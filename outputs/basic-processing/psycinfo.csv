We aimed to investigate the prevalence of FOC among Chinese population and its impact on mode of delivery, postpartum mental health and breastfeeding. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study, wherein pregnant women in their third trimester who underwent antenatal assessments at Shanghai Changning Maternity and Infant Health Hospital between September 2020 and March 2021 were recruited. Sociodemographic data of the participants were gathered by self-administered questionnaire, and their FOC was assessed using the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire. Participants were followed up to 42 days postpartum. Information regarding their modes of delivery was retrieved from medical records, and data regarding postpartum mental health symptoms and one-month postpartum breastfeeding were obtained through self-administered questionnaires. Results: Among 1287 participants, 461 (35.8 %) had high-level FOC (W-DEQ >= 66). Logistic regressions showed that women with high-level of FOC had higher rates of caesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR) (aOR = 1.55, 95 % CI: 1.00-2.41, p = 0.049), a higher incidence of postpartum mental health symptoms (aOR = 1.68, 95 % CI: 1.09-2.59, p = 0.018), lower rates of one-month postpartum exclusive breastfeeding (aOR = 0.33, 95 % CI: 0.16-0.69, p = 0.003) and mixed feeding (aOR = 0.44, 95 % CI: 0.21-0.91, p = 0.028). Limitations: The long-term implications of FOC beyond the immediate postpartum period were not explored in the study. Conclusions: High-level FOC during the third trimester was associated with increased CDMR and postpartum mental health symptoms and reduced breastfeeding establishment. These results underscore the significance of FOC screening and tailored interventions for affected women.

cesareansectionandchilddevelopmentat3years:aprospectivecohortstudyoffirstbirthsinpennsylvania;2022;sznajder,cesarean section and child development at 3 years: a prospective cohort study of first births in pennsylvania,2022.0,"Sznajder, Kristin, K.;Teti, Douglas;Hackman, Nicole, M.;Massare, Brittany;Kjerulff, Kristen, H.","ObjectivesThe rising cesarean birth rate globally has led to increasing concern about long-term unintended consequences, with particular focus on child neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study investigated the association between cesarean birth and early child neurodevelopment, measured at 3 years of age.MethodsThis was a large multicenter longitudinal prospective cohort study of first-time mothers and their offspring in Pennsylvania. Mothers completed adapted versions of two measures of child development at 36- months postpartum: the modified Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (M-PEDS) and a shortened Ages and Stages Questionnaire (S-ASQ). Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between mode of delivery and delayed child development, controlling for confounding variables.ResultsThere were 695 (29.3%) children born by cesarean delivery and 1676 (70.7) born vaginally. Children born by cesarean had increased odds of scoring as developmentally delayed on both measures of child development: the M-PEDS (8.9% cesarean and 5.1% vaginal, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-2.24)) and the S-ASQ (6.3% cesarean and 3.3% vaginal, aOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.09-2.54). Additional factors associated with developmental delay were male sex, and the maternal factors of high pre-pregnancy body mass index, thyroid disorder, and diabetes.ConclusionIn this large prospective cohort study of first-time mothers and their offspring, cesarean delivery was found to be associated with an elevated risk of delayed child development at age 3 years. This analysis highlights the importance of continued research to understand the impact of cesarean delivery on child development.

This study evaluated the interactive effects of preoperative beta-endorphin (BE) concentrations (a key analgesic endogenous opioid) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and ECs (CSF and plasma 2-arachidonoylglycerol and plasma anandamide) on postoperative opioid use and pain intensity in a prospective cohort of n = 112 pregnant patients undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery. Maternal blood and CSF samples were collected preoperatively for BE and EC assays. Patients completed measures of outpatient opioid use (number of tablets used and days of use) and average pain intensity at 2 weeks postoperatively. Results of general linear model analyses controlling for maternal age, body mass index at time of delivery, and race revealed significant multiplicative interactions between EC and BE concentrations on number of opioid tablets used (based on pill count), days of opioid use, and total milligram morphine equivalents used in the 2-week follow-up period. Elevated preoperative plasma and CSF 2-arachidonoylglycerol predicted reduced outpatient opioid analgesic use, particularly for patients low in CSF BE. Similar analyses for pain intensity at 2-week follow-up indicated a significant interaction (P < .02) characterized by higher preoperative BE concentrations being associated with lower subsequent pain only for individuals with low preoperative plasma anandamide concentrations. Further exploration of interactions between EC and endogenous opioid inhibitory systems as they influence responses to opioid analgesics in other clinical pain populations may help guide the development of precision pain management approaches. PERSPECTIVE: In the postoperative setting of patients undergoing cesarean delivery, elevated ECs were linked to reduced outpatient opioid analgesic use in individuals who had low endogenous opioid concentrations in CSF. Further exploration of interactions between these 2 inhibitory systems as they impact responses to pain management interventions appears warranted.

Although it has been prescribed during pregnancy for decades, the safety for neonates and obstetric outcomes are a topic of ongoing scientific debate as previous research has yielded contradicting outcomes. Our study aims to compare (re)admission rates and reasons for admissions in neonates born to women with bipolar disorders (BD) with and without lithium exposure. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a Dutch secondary hospital (two locations in Amsterdam). Women with BD who gave birth after a singleton pregnancy between January 2011 and March 2021 and their neonates were included. Outcomes were obtained by medical chart review of mothers and neonates and compared between neonates with and without lithium exposure. The primary outcome was admission to a neonatal ward with monitoring, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), 5-minute Apgar scores, neonatal asphyxia, and readmission <= 28 days. Results: We included 93 women with BD, who gave birth to 117 live-born neonates: 42 (36%) exposed and 75 (64%) non-exposed to lithium. There were no significant differences in neonatal admission with monitoring (16.7 vs. 20.0%, p = 0.844). Additionally, preterm birth (7.1 vs. 5.3%), SGA (0.0 vs. 8.0%), 5-minute Apgar scores (means 9.50 vs. 9.51), neonatal asphyxia (4.8 vs. 2.7%) and readmission (4.8 vs. 5.3%) were comparable. Overall, 18.8% of BD offspring was admitted. Women with BD had high rates of caesarean section ( 29.1%), gestational diabetes (12.8%) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (8.5%). Conclusions: In a sample of neonates all born to women with BD using various other psychotropic drugs, exposure to lithium was not associated with greater risk of neonatal admission to a ward with monitoring compared to non-exposure to lithium, questioning the necessity for special measures after lithium exposure. However, offspring of women with BD was admitted regularly and women with BD have high obstetric risk which require clinical and scientific attention.

Previous research implicates associations between maternal prenatal symptoms of depression and infants' glucocorticoid (GC) levels shortly after birth. To date, associations have not been investigated in the early postnatal period. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of maternal perinatal symptoms of depression on infants' neonatal and postnatal hair GCs providing a retrospective reflection of integrated cortisol secretion in the intrauterine and early postnatal period, respectively. Methods: As part of a prospective cohort study, hair samples of infants were taken up to two weeks after delivery (N = 152) and again eight weeks after delivery (N = 165). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine hair cortisol and cortisone in scalp-near 2-cm hair segments. Maternal symptoms of depression were assessed during pregnancy and eight weeks postnatally based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Results: Higher maternal prenatal symptoms of depression showed a significant association with higher infants' neonatal hair cortisol, when controlling for confounding variables (i.e., gestational age, mode of delivery, parity, storage time, pregnancy complications). A non-significant trend for this effect was found for the hair cortisol-to-cortisone ratio while no effect occurred for hair cortisone. No association of maternal postnatal symptoms of depression with infants' postnatal hair GCs was observed. Further exploratory analyses revealed no relationship between a change of maternal prenatal to postnatal symptoms of depression with the change from infants' neonatal to postnatal hair GC levels or postnatal hair GCs. Conclusion: Our results suggest that maternal prenatal symptoms of depression are associated with dysregulated infants' hair cortisol levels mainly incorporated in the intrauterine period which, in turn, might contribute to increased susceptibility for later diseases. However, no relationship was observed in infants' hair samples additionally reflecting hair GCs of the early postnatal period. Future studies should consider research on associations between maternal symptoms of depression and infants' hair GCs also later in life and take into account additional risk factors with potential impacts on GC secretion during early infancy.

Their equal contribution has been noted in the online manuscript, which should remain unchanged.] Maternal prenatal depression is associated with child sleep. We investigated whether maternal depression comorbid with anxiety worsens toddler's sleep problems in a prospective cohort study. A total of 1583 mother-infant pairs from the China-Anhui Birth Cohort study were examined. The participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) at 30-34 weeks of gestation, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3-month postpartum. Toddler's sleep was assessed by the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) at 30 months old. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between prenatal depression and anxiety and toddler's sleep, while adjusting for maternal gestational age, education, family income, alcohol use, premature birth, fetal growth restriction, mode of delivery, postnatal depression, and 3-month breastfeeding. In total, 9.0% of participants reported prenatal depression comorbid with anxiety symptoms, and the prevalence of depression, anxiety was 6.7% and 7.3%, respectively. Compared with mothers without depression and anxiety, maternal depression combined with anxiety were significantly associated with shorter total sleep duration (11.16 +- 1.06 h), longer settling time (29.25 +- 23.57 min), and higher risk of toddlers' sleep problems assessed by BISQ (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.22-3.57) or parental report (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.22-2.77). However, there was no significant association between maternal postnatal depression and toddler sleep behaviors. Maternal prenatal depression comorbid with anxiety significantly associated with poorer toddler's sleep. Strategies to regulate prenatal mood status should be considered during prenatal health care to improve children's sleep development.

Methods: Pregnant women were recruited at the antenatal care in Sweden and 1832 women were included after exclusion of miscarriages, terminated pregnancies and missing data on vitamin D status. Mode of delivery was retrieved from medical records. EMCS was defined as caesarean section after onset of labour. Birth asphyxia was defined as either 5 min Apgar score < 7 or arterial umbilical cord pH < 7.1. Serum was sampled in the third trimester of pregnancy (T3) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25OHD < 30 nmol/L, and associations were studied using logistic regression analysis and expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AOR). Results: In total, 141 (7.7%) women had an EMCS and 58 (3.2%) children were born with birth asphyxia. Vitamin D deficiency was only associated with higher odds of EMCS in women without epidural anaesthesia (AOR = 2.01, p = 0.044). Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with higher odds of birth asphyxia (AOR = 2.22, p = 0.044). Conclusions for Practice: In this Swedish prospective population-based cohort study, vitamin D deficiency in late pregnancy was associated with doubled odds of birth asphyxia and with EMCS in deliveries not aided by epidural anaesthesia. Prevention of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women may reduce the incidence of EMCS and birth asphyxia. The mechanism behind the findings require further investigation.

In this study, we investigated the association between mode of delivery at first childbirth and birth experience, using a new scale developed specifically to measure women's affective response. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of 3006 women who were interviewed during pregnancy and 1-month postpartum. The First Baby Study Birth Experience Scale was used to measure the association between mode of delivery and women's postpartum feelings about their childbirth, taking into account relevant confounders, including maternal age, race, education, pregnancy intendedness, depression, social support, and maternal and newborn complications by way of linear and logistic regression models. Results: Women who had unplanned cesarean delivery had the least positive feelings overall about their first childbirth, in comparison to those whose deliveries were spontaneous vaginal (P < .001), instrumental vaginal (P = .001), and planned cesarean (P < .001). In addition, those who delivered by unplanned cesarean were more likely to feel disappointed (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.62-8.35]) and like a failure (adjusted OR 5.09 [95% CI 3.65-7.09]) in comparison to women who had spontaneous vaginal delivery; and less likely to feel extremely or quite a bit proud of themselves (adjusted OR 2.70 [95% CI 2.20-3.30]).

However, previous study results were inconsistent, especially in the low- and middle- income countries. We aimed to study the association between antenatal depression and adverse perinatal outcomes in a Chinese population. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study and enrolled pregnant women from January 2020 to January 2021. Antenatal depressive symptoms in the third trimester of pregnancy were evaluated by the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). Baseline characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were recorded. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, occupation, education level, and annual income), multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the associations between antenatal depression and pregnancy outcomes. Results: Among the 5209 participants, 1448 (27.7 %) pregnant women were positive for depression. After adjusting for potential confounders, women with antenatal depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to deliver prematurely [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.404, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.020-1.933, P = 0.037] and receive cesarean section (OR = 1.154, 95 % CI = 1.002-1.331, P = 0.048). Limitations: EPDS, not a structured diagnostic interview, was used for psychological assessment. In addition, we only screened the women in their third trimester in a single research center.

Prebiotics have been demonstrated to suppress appetite in both adults and children. Therefore, HMOs may affect infant eating behaviour. Objective: To determine if HMOs in breast milk are associated with eating behaviour in Hispanic infants. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort of Hispanic mother-infant dyads (1-month, n = 157; 6-months, n = 69). Breast milk samples were screened for 19 HMOs using high pressure liquid chromatography, and eating behaviour was assessed using the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (BEBQ). We conducted multiple linear regressions to examine associations between HMOs and BEBQ scores, adjusted for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, infant sex, birthweight, delivery mode and number of breastfeedings per day. We stratified by HMO secretor status--a genetic determinant of the types of HMOs produced. Results: At 1 month, LNnT (lacto-N-neotetraose; P = .04) was negatively associated with food responsiveness in the total sample, while DFLNT (difucosyllacto-N-tetrose; P = .03) and DSLNT (disialyl-LNT; P = .04) were negatively associated with food responsiveness in secretors only.

H., D.;van Lith, Jan M., M.;Wijma, Barbro","Purpose: This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the interrelation between preferred/actual mode of delivery and pre- and postpartum fear of childbirth (FOC). Material and methods: Participants from 13 midwifery practices and four hospitals in Southwest Netherlands filled out questionnaires at 30 weeks' gestation (n = 561) and two months postpartum (n = 463), including questions on preferred mode of delivery, the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Results were related to obstetric data. Results: Both severe FOC (OR 7.0, p < .001) and previous Cesarean section (CS) (OR 16.6, p < .001) predicted preference for CS. Severe prepartum FOC also predicted actual CS. Preferring a vaginal delivery (VD) and actually having a CS predicted higher postpartum W-DEQ scores (partial r = 0.107, p < .05). Other significant predictors for high postpartum W-DEQ scores were high prepartum W-DEQ (partial r = 0.357) and HADS anxiety scores (partial r = 0.143) and the newborn in need of medical assistance (partial r = -0.169). Conclusions: Women preferring a VD but ending up with a CS are at risk for severe FOC postpartum, while the same risk was not demonstrated for women who preferred a CS but had a VD. Prepartum FOC is strongly associated with postpartum FOC, regardless of congruence between preferred and actual mode of delivery.

However, we lack brief measures to reliably identify individuals who experience childbirth trauma and who may be at greater prospective risk for PPD. To address this gap, we used data from a racially diverse prospective cohort (n=1082). We collected survey data during pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum, as well as clinician-reported data from medical records. A new three-item measure of patient-reported childbirth trauma was a robust and independent risk factor for PPD, above and beyond other known risk factors for PPD, including prenatal anxiety and depression. Cesarean birth, greater blood loss, and preterm birth were each associated with greater patient-reported childbirth trauma. Finally, there were prospective indirect pathways whereby cesarean birth and higher blood loss were related to higher patient-reported childbirth trauma, in turn predicting greater risk for PPD. Early universal postpartum screening for childbirth trauma, targeted attention to individuals with childbirth complications, and continued screening for depression and anxiety can identify individuals at risk for PPD. Such efforts can inform targeted interventions to improve maternal mental health, which plays a vital role in infant development.

The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of developing adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes between pregnant women with moderate-severe depression and those who had mild depression. Methods: Our study was performed in a prospective cohort of 360 depressed pregnant women, recruited and followed up to delivery at the Adventist Hospital in Bekwai Municipality, Ghana. The research began in February 2020 and the follow-up was completed in August 2020. The pregnant women who had depression were classified into two groups: those who had moderate-severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaires-9 (PHQ-9) score >=15) and those who had mild depression (PHQ-9 score <15). Crude and adjusted relative risk (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for women with moderate-severe depression as compared with women with mild depression were then estimated. Result: Out of a total of 360 pregnant women, 43 (11.9%) screened positive for moderate-severe depression. After adjusting for potential confounders, women with moderate-severe depression during pregnancy, as compared with women who had mild depression had an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (RR adjusted = 2.01; 95% CI:1.21-3.33); Caesarean section (RR adjusted = 1.78; 95% CI:1.18-2.70); and episiotomy (RR adjusted = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.06-2.60). On the other hand, no statistically significant association of severity of depression and perinatal outcomes was observed. Conclusion: Compared with mild depression, symptoms of moderate-severe depression in pregnancy significantly increased risks of adverse maternal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, caesarean section delivery, and episiotomy.

There is, however, little research integrating these variables into one model to analyze their interrelations. The aim of this observational prospective longitudinal study is to examine whether the effect of CS on postpartum depressive symptoms is mediated by difficulties with breastfeeding. Methods: The participants were recruited in 5 maternity hospitals during their prenatal medical check-ups. Breastfeeding status was self-reported by the mothers six weeks postpartum. Screening for depressive symptoms was performed at six weeks (N = 404) and nine months (N = 234) postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Path analysis was used to model the relations between CS, breastfeeding, and depressive symptoms. Results: No direct effects of CS on depressive symptoms at six weeks or nine months postpartum were found. CS was associated with a lower probability of exclusive breastfeeding, which was, in turn, associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms six weeks postpartum. The analysis stratified by type of CS revealed that the effect on breastfeeding only occurred with emergency, not planned, CS. The effect of CS on breastfeeding was noticeably stronger in women without versus with a history of depression. Conclusion: Emergency CS predicts breastfeeding difficulties, which are, in turn, associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Support should be provided to mothers with emergency CS and breastfeeding problems to reduce the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period.

We aimed to examine the risk of gestational weight gain for PPDS at 1 month postpartum based on the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Methods: A prospective cohort study recruited 80 927 Japanese women 2011-2014. They categorized according to their pre-pregnancy BMI into group 1 (<18.5 kg/m2), group 2 (18.5 to <20.0 kg/m2), group 3 (20.0 to <23.0 kg/m2), group 4 (23.0 to <25.0 kg/m2), and group 5 (>= 25.0 kg/m2). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for each BMI category to identify potential risk factors of insufficient or excessive gestational weight gain associated with PPDS, following adjustments for maternal age, education, annual household income, smoking, parity, mode of delivery, cessation of breast feeding, psychological stress, and daily energy intakes during pregnancy. Results: Among participants in group 3, insufficient gestational weight gain was a risk factor for PPDS (adjusted odds ratio: 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.14-1.36). This result was not modified by intermediate factors. Limitations: The criteria of appropriate gestational weight gain were determined from the adverse pregnancy outcomes not validated for PPDS. Other confounding factors for PPDS like psychotic disorders were not examined. Conclusions: For women with a pre-pregnancy BMI between 20.0 and <23.0 kg/m2, insufficient gestational weight gain is a risk factor for PPDS. Therefore, monitoring gestational weight gain is recommended for the early detection of PPDS in these women.

Pregnant women with BD have shown an increased rate of caesarean section (C-Section) in comparison with women without BD. Because specific differentiated profiles between mothers with BD that require C-Section and those that do not require C-Section have not been largely discussed, we aim to explore the risk factors associated with the type of delivery in pregnant women with BD. A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Perinatal Mental Health Unit. 100 pregnant women with BD were followed throughout their pregnancy by obstetric and psychiatric services at the same hospital. The cohort was developed in order to compare psychiatric and obstetric outcomes between women with BD that required C-Section (N = 40) versus women that did not require C-Section (N = 60). Final regression models showed an increased risk for obstetric complications during labour (OR 4,52, 95% CI 1,66-12,29), higher rates of hypothyroidism (OR 3,73, 95% CI 1,04-13,73) and treatment with lithium + antidepressant (OR 4,24, 95% CI 1,34-13,40) amongst the C-Section group when compared to the non-C-Section group. In our sample, women with BD treated with lithium plus antidepressant, with hypothyroidism and without obstetric complications have a 70,5% probability of C-Section. In conclusion, psychopharmacology and thyroid function might help understanding which women with BD will have more probability of C-Section. The implementation of more targeted interventions in selected patients might be useful to avoid complications during delivery.

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies greater than 34 weeks' gestation powered to evaluate a difference in mode of delivery. Maternal characteristics, antenatal factors, neonatal characteristics, and patient satisfaction measures were compared between groups. Differences between groups were analyzed using chi-squared for categorical variables, Fisher exact test for dichotomous variables, and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous or ordinal variables. Results: Three hundred women were recruited: 143 (48%) had a birth plan. There was no significant difference in the risk of cesarean delivery for women with a birth plan compared with those without a birth plan (21% vs 16%, adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-2.04]). Women with a birth plan were 28% less likely to receive oxytocin (P < .01), 29% less likely to undergo artificial rupture of membranes (P < .01), and 31% less likely to have an epidural (P < .01). There was no difference in the length of labor (P = .12). Women with a birth plan were less satisfied (P < .01) and felt less in control (P < .01) of their birth experience than those without a birth plan. Conclusion: Women with and without a birth plan had similar odds of cesarean delivery. Though they had fewer obstetrical interventions, they were less satisfied with their birth experience, compared with women without birth plans. Further research is needed to understand how to improve childbirth-related patient satisfaction.

Despite guidelines describing women's rights to make an informed choice, trial of labor and VBAC rates vary greatly worldwide. Many women are inadequately informed due to caregivers' fear of an increase in CS rates in a high VBAC rate setting. We compared counseling with a decision aid (DA) including a prediction model on VBAC to care as usual. We hypothesize that counselling with the DA does not decrease VBAC rates. In addition, we aimed to study the effects on unplanned CS rate, patient involvement in decision- making and elective repeat CS rates. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study. From 2012 to 2014, 483 women in six hospitals, where the DA was used (intervention group), were compared with 441 women in six matched hospitals (control group). Women with one previous CS, pregnant of a singleton in cephalic presentation, delivering after 37 weeks 0 days were eligible for inclusion. Results: There was no significant difference in VBAC rates between the intervention (45%) and control group (46%) (adjusted odds ratio 0,92 (95% Confidence interval 0.69-1.23)). In the intervention group more women (42%) chose an elective repeat CS compared to the control group (31%) (adjusted odds ratio 1.6 (95% Confidence interval 1.18-2.17)). Of women choosing trial of labor, in the intervention group 77% delivered vaginally compared to 67% in the control group, resulting in an unplanned CS adjusted odds ratio of 0,57 (0.40-0.82) in the intervention group. In the intervention group, more women reported to be involved in decision-making (98% vs. 68%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Implementing a decision aid with a prediction model for risk selection suggests unchanged VBAC rates, but 40% reduction in unplanned CS rates, increase in elective repeat CS and improved patient involvement in decision-making.

therelationshipbetweenneutrophil-lymphocyteratioandonsetoflactationamongpostpartumwomen:aprospectiveobservationalcohortstudy;2019;he,the relationship between neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and onset of lactation among postpartum women: a prospective observational cohort study,2019.0,"He, Shenghong;Xia, Haiou","Background: Delayed onset of lactation is a key factor in the low rate of exclusive breast-feeding in 6 months after caesarean section. The mechanism of delayed onset of lactation is not clear. Milk production depends largely on mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is closely related to mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid copy number and adenosine triphosphate production. Presently, it is unclear whether a difference in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio exists between those undergoing vaginal delivery and those undergoing caesarean delivery and, if so, whether the difference correlates to the time of onset of lactation. Objectives: To identify whether the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio at 24 hours after delivery is different between mothers delivering by caesarean section and those giving birth vaginally and whether the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is related to the delayed onset of lactation. Design: The study adopted a prospective cohort study design. Settings: Maternity units of an Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital. Participants: 327 mother-infant pairs who met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were followed up to the time of onset of lactation. Methods: Mother-infant pairs were allocated to the vaginal birth group or the caesarean section group according to birth method. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was calculated as the absolute value of neutrophils divided by the absolute value of lymphocytes based on full blood counts. Before delivery, full blood counts were obtained from medical records. After delivery, blood samples were drawn 24 hours postpartum, and blood cells were classified and counted. The onset of lactation was confirmed by the maternal perception of breast fullness. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and its relationship with lactation onset were analyzed by multivariable regression. Results: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios of both groups were elevated after delivery. Based on the covariance analysis, after adjusting for baseline full blood counts before delivery, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in the caesarean group was higher than the ratio in the vaginal group after delivery (p = .000). In addition, after adjustment for confounding factors, multivariable regression analyses showed that an increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was correlated with delayed onset of lactation (95% confidence interval 0.285-1.646). Conclusions: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in the caesarean section group was higher than that in the vaginal delivery group and was related to a delayed onset of lactation. Given the decreased mitochondrial copy number in the elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and therefore the associated reduction in adenosine triphosphate synthesis, these findings may elucidate the mechanism for delayed onset of lactation in caesarean section births.

We investigated the potential causality between ADHD and two surrogate markers for changes in children's microbiota: birth delivery mode and early childhood antibiotic use. Method: This population-based, prospective cohort study linked nationwide registers of data for native Danish singleton live births in Denmark from 1997 to 2010. Exposure variables were delivery mode and antibiotic use during the first 2 years of life. The main outcome measure was ADHD diagnosis or redeemed ADHD medication prescriptions. For statistical analysis, we used both advanced sibling models and a more traditional approach. Results: We included 671,592 children, followed from their second birthday in the period 1999-2014 for 7,300,522 person-years. ADHD was diagnosed in 17,971. In total, 17.5% were born by cesarean delivery, and 72% received antibiotic treatment within their first 2 years of life. In the adjusted between-within sibling survival model, mode of delivery or antibiotics had no effect on ADHD when compared with vaginal delivery or no antibiotic treatment as hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.97-1.24) for intrapartum cesarean, 1.03 (0.91-1.16) for prelabor cesarean, 0.98 (0.90-1.07) for penicillin, and 0.99 (0.92-1.06) for broader spectrum antibiotics. In a sibling-stratified Cox regression, intrapartum cesarean was associated with increased ADHD risk, but other exposures were not. In a descriptive, nonstratified Cox model, we found increased risk for ADHD for all exposures. Conclusions: Detailed family confounder control using the superior between-within model indicates that cesarean delivery or use of antibiotics during the first 2 years of life does not increase ADHD risk. Therefore, our study suggests that changes in children's microbiota related to cesarean delivery or antibiotic use, do not cause ADHD.

In light of the gut-brain axis hypothesis, cesarean section may influence risk of affective disorders. Methods: Population based prospective cohort study included Danish children born 1982 through 2001, with follow-up until 2015. The effect of delivery mode on the risk of affective disorders was assessed using a standard Cox model and two types of Cox sibling models. Diagnostic codes or prescriptions for antidepressants and lithium were used to define cases of affective disorders. Results: 1,009,444 children were followed for 8,880,794 person-years from the age of 13 years, with relevant covariates available from birth. There are strong calendar time trends in the occurrence of affective disorders with an increasingly younger age at first diagnosis and with a hotspot between the years 2007-2012. Fully adjusted standard Cox models showed an increased risk of affective disorders for both pre-labor (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.15) and intrapartum (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10) cesarean section, compared to vaginal delivery.

Aim of our study was to compare the characteristics, satisfaction, continuation rates, and adverse effects between users of the high-dose LNG-IUS (52 mg) and of the low dose LNG-IUS (13.5 mg and 19.5 mg). Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed in two Services for Family Planning in normal menstruating women with the inclusion of all new prescriptions of LNG-IUS for contraception. Women were followed for a mean of 9.1 +- 2.6 months after placement. Results: 109 women (mean age of 39.8 +- 8.7 years old) were included, 69.7% using a high dose LNG-IUS and 30.3% using a low dose LNG-IUS. Women with a low dose LNG-IUS were significantly younger, thinner, more nulliparous, with fewer vaginal deliveries and C-sections, with a lower menstrual flow length and with more previous use of short-acting reversible contraceptives (p < 0.05). LNG-IUS continuation was similar and very high at the last follow-up: 100 vs. 94.7% in the low and high dose LNG-IUS groups, respectively (p = 0.18). Satisfaction with treatment at the end of the study was similar between different LNG-IUS doses (p = 0.85), with 78.9% being satisfied/very satisfied. Bleeding patterns were significantly different between the two LNG-IUS doses (p < 0.0001). Diagnosis of dysfunctional cysts was more frequent in women with high dose compared to low dose LNG-IUS (22.2 vs. 12.1%), albeit not significantly. Conclusions: We have shown a clear differential use of available LNG-IUS in clinical practice, both as baseline characteristics and as different outcomes, primarily for bleeding patterns. However, all these systems were associated with a very high rate of satisfaction and continuation.

Our objectives were to: determine if sources of information influencing a pregnant woman's preferred delivery mode and knowledge of cesarean indications differ by sociodemographic characteristics; to conduct a factor analysis of items related to information sources influencing this preference; and to determine if knowledge differs by information sources influencing this preference or their underlying latent constructs. Methods: Data from a prospective cohort study conducted in Buenos Aires was analyzed. Healthy nulliparous women aged 18-35, at > 32 weeks of gestation and with live, singleton pregnancies participated. The primary research questions were evaluated using Chi-square tests, factor analysis, logistic regression, and generalized estimating equations. Results: A total of 382 women participated in the study. Women of lower socioeconomic status were more influenced by people, magazines and TV/movies in their mode of delivery preferences, and had poorer knowledge of cesarean indications. Sources of influence for preferred delivery mode and factors derived in factor analysis were not associated with knowledge level when considered individually or together, or when adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, or when accounting for clustering by the hospital sector (public or private). Conclusions: Higher socioeconomic status is associated with being less influenced by people and with better knowledge of indications for cesarean delivery. Knowledge of cesarean indications was not associated with the source of information about mode of delivery preferences.

Methods: A prospective cohort study of 2851 nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies who attempted vaginal delivery at hospitals in Pennsylvania, 2009-2011, was conducted. We used nested logistic regression models and multiple mediational analyses to investigate the role of three groups of variables in explaining the association between labor induction and unplanned cesarean delivery--the confounders of maternal characteristics and indications for induction, and the mediating (intrapartum) factors--including cervical dilatation, labor augmentation, epidural analgesia, dysfunctional labor, dystocia, fetal intolerance of labor, and maternal request of cesarean during labor. Results: More than a third of the women were induced (34.3%) and 24.8% underwent cesarean delivery. Induced women were more likely to deliver by cesarean (35.9%) than women in spontaneous labor (18.9%), unadjusted OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.97-2.79). The intrapartum factors significantly mediated the association between labor induction and cesarean delivery (explaining 76.7% of this association), particularly cervical dilatation < 3 cm at hospital admission, fetal intolerance of labor, and dystocia. The indications for labor induction only explained 6.2%. Conclusions: Increased risk of cesarean delivery after labor induction among nulliparous women is attributable mainly to lower cervical dilatation at hospital admission and higher rates of labor complications.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study between June and September 2018 in 210 women who opted for IUD placement for contraception. Sixty-six women who had previously had only vaginal delivery under epidural analgesia were allocated to the epidural delivery group; 60 women who had previously had at least one vaginal delivery without epidural analgesia were allocated to the vaginal delivery group; and 84 women who had previously had only caesarean delivery were allocated to the caesarean delivery group. Participants' levels of anxiety before insertion were measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory; participants' levels of pain (anticipated pain and pain at the various stages of IUD insertion and 15 min after the procedure) were assessed using a visual analogue scale. Results: While the experience of caesarean delivery and pre-procedure anxiety were found to be associated with higher pain scores, the presence of negative perceptions of IUDs was the most significant predictor of pain during IUD insertion (p < .001). Experience of vaginal delivery under epidural analgesia was associated with lower pain scores at IUD insertion (p < .001). Conclusion: Fear of IUD insertion pain, pre-procedure anxiety and negative perceptions of IUDs may lead women to anticipate or feel a higher level of pain. Patient education to correct negative perceptions of IUDs and counselling to inform women of the true benefits and risks of IUDs and lower pre-procedure anxiety are a suggested strategy to manage IUD insertion pain in parous women.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created substantial stress for pregnant women. Purpose To understand whether stress experienced by women pregnant at the beginning of the pandemic was associated with a greater prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Methods: Pregnant women across the USA aged >=18 years old enrolled in a prospective cohort study during the pandemic onset (T1) in April-May 2020. This report focuses on the 1,367 participants who gave birth prior to July-August 2020 (T2). Hierarchical logistic regression models predicted preterm birth, small for gestational age infants, and unplanned operative delivery from T1 stress, sociodemographic, and medical factors. Results: After controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors, preterm birth was predicted by high prenatal maternal stress, delivering an infant small for gestational age was predicted by interpersonal violence and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic, and unplanned cesarean or operative vaginal delivery was predicted by prenatal appointment alterations, experiencing a major stressful life event, and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic. Independent of these associations, African American women were more likely than other groups to deliver preterm. Conclusion: Pregnant women who are experiencing high stress during the COVID-19 pandemic are at risk of poorer perinatal outcomes. A longitudinal investigation is critical to determine whether prenatal maternal stress and resulting outcomes have longer-term consequences for the health and well-being of children born in the midst of the current pandemic. Pregnant women who experienced greater stress during the COVID-19 pandemic onset were more likely to have a preterm birth, to deliver a small-for-gestational-age infant, and to have an unplanned operative delivery.

Methods: In this prospective cohort study 3006 nulliparous women living in Pennsylvania, USA, were asked about CR-PTSD at 1-month postpartum, and maternal-infant bonding at 1, 6 and 12-months postpartum. Multivariable logistic regression models identified risk factors for CR-PTSD and associations between CR-PTSD and maternal-infant bonding at 1, 6 and 12-months postpartum, controlling for confounding variables - including postpartum depression, stress and social support. Results: Nearly half (47.5%) of the women reported that during labor and delivery they were afraid that they or their baby might be hurt or die, and 225 women (7.5%) reported experiencing one or more CR-PTSD symptoms at 1-month postpartum. Depression, stress and low social support during pregnancy were associated with CR-PTSD, as well as labor induction, delivery complications, poor pain control, and unplanned cesarean delivery. Women with CR-PTSD reported a less positive childbirth experience, less shared decision-making, and were more likely to score in the bottom third on maternal-infant bonding at 1-month postpartum (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.5, 95% CI 1.8-3.3, p < 0.001); at 6-months postpartum (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-2.8, p < 0.001); and at 12-months postpartum (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.0, p < 0.001).

Aims: To assess feelings towards newborn infants in mothers who delivered by cesarean delivery, elective (ElCD) or emergency (EmCD). Study design: This observational prospective study took place at the Division of Perinatal Medicine, Policlinico Abano Terme, Abano Terme, Italy, from September 2014 to April 2015. Subjects: The sample included 573 puerperae divided into three groups: women undergone ElCD (n = 73; 12.73%), women undergone EmCD (n = 81; 14.13%) and women who underwent vaginal delivery (VD) (n = 419; 73.12%). Outcome measures: The instrument used was the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS; Taylor et al., 2005), a self-report test to measure mother's feelings towards her baby. High scores indicate worse mother-to-infant bonding and a score >= 2, established as cut-off, indicates an altered bonding. Results: The mean MIBS global score was 0.50 +- 1.05 in the VD mothers, 0.67 (+-1.14) for ElCD mothers and 0.92 (+-1.05) for EmCD mothers, resulting significantly higher in EmCD mothers (p < 0.001). The percentage of altered bonding (Score >= 2) in the three groups was of 11.21% (n = 47) in VD, 17.80% (n = 13) in ElCD and 23.45% (n = 19) in EmCD, significantly higher in EmCD women (p < 0.006). In addition, EmCD mothers scored significantly higher Joyful (0.074 +- 0.26 vs 0.185 +- 0.39; p < 0.005) and Disappointed (0.063 +- 0.25 vs 0.123 +- 0.36; p < 0.008) subscales. Conclusions: It was found that EmCD negatively affects mother bonding and opening emotions, and originates in mother feelings like sadness and disappointment for the unplanned delivery evolution.

Nevertheless, there is conflicting evidence about the influence of mode of delivery (MD). Aim: To prospectively evaluate the relationship between MD and sexual health outcomes after childbirth. Methods: A prospective cohort study conducted between May 2005 and March 2007 included 831 pregnant women recruited from primary care clinics of the public sector in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The exposure variable was MD: uncomplicated vaginal delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery without episiotomy or any kind of perineal laceration); complicated vaginal delivery (either forceps or normal, with episiotomy or any kind of perineal laceration) and cesarean delivery. Socio-demographic and obstetric data were obtained through a questionnaire applied during the antenatal and postnatal period. Crude and adjusted risk ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using Poisson regression to examine the associations between MD and sexual health outcomes. Main Outcome Measures: The three main sexual health outcomes were later resumption of sexual life, self-perception of decline of sexual life (DSL), and presence of sexual desire. Results: One hundred and forty-one women (21.9%) resumed sexual life 3 or more months after delivery. Although 87.1% of women had desire, DSL occurred in 21.1% of the cohort. No associations were found between MD and sexual health outcomes. Conclusions: Women's sexuality after childbirth were not influenced by the type of delivery. Efforts to improve the treatment of sexual problems after childbirth should focus beyond MD.

Background: Women experience many physiologic and psychological changes during postpartum period, which is considered a vital transitional time. Exploring and meeting women's needs help woman to pass this period with little complications and enhance healthcare provider's ability to provide appropriate care following childbirth. Design: A prospective cohort design was employed in this study. Methods: A prospective cohort design was employed. A convenience sample of 150 postpartum women have completed perceived leaning needs scale prior to hospital discharge, at southern region of Jordan, and have completed perceived met learning needs scale at 6-8 weeks after giving birth. Results: Women reported a high level of concern across all eight learning needs subscales. The most common concerns were related to new baby care, episiotomy care and breastfeeding. At 6-8 weeks postpartum, the primary unmet learning needs postpartum were danger signs post-Caesarean section, physical changes, breastfeeding and new baby care. Attending postpartum check-up clinic was found as a significant predictor for postpartum meeting women's needs, particularly emotional changes and family planning-related information. Conclusions: The current maternal health services are not at the optimum level to meet women's individual needs and concerns, which could increase the risk for postpartum complications. Some women's characteristics, such as employment status and educational level, have increased women's concerns and unmet needs in some of the learning needs. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare providers and policymakers should consider women's concerns and needs at early postpartum period to establish patient-centred postpartum care that is based on women's needs and concerns during this transitional period, with a focus on newborn baby care, episiotomy care and breastfeeding.

Two groups considered at-risk for PTSD were included (i.e., women giving birth to a LBW infant requiring NICU admission, and those who experienced an EmCB) and two low-risk groups (i.e., women who had a vaginal birth (VB) and those who had a planned caesarean birth (PCB)). This study examined four main hypotheses. We expected that: 1) at each time women in the two at-risk groups would experience greater PTSD symptoms compared to women in the low-risk groups, 2) the decrease in mean PTSD symptom levels for at-risk groups would be less than in the low-risk groups from 5 to 8, and 8 to 26 weeks postpartum, 3) the at-risk groups would have poorer maternal interactive behavior compared low-risk groups; and 4) regardless of group, women with clinically important PTSD symptom levels (e.g., scores in the clinical range) would exhibit poorer interactive behavior compared to women without; and women with co-morbidity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, would also have poorer interactive behavior. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted. Associations between PTSD symptoms and interactive behaviors were examined. The proportion of women in the clinical range in the different groups was explored. Lastly, we also investigated the proportion of women who had symptom levels in the clinical range on the self-report measure of PTSD compared to the more rigorous structured interview; and the concordance between these two measures with respect to classification of women in the clinical range.

While having a caesarean section (C-section) is known to be a significant risk factor for postpartum PTSD, it is currently unknown whether coexisting anaesthesia-related factors are also associated to the disorder. The aim of this study was to assess anaesthesia-linked factors in the development of acute postpartum PTSD. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study on women having a C-section in a tertiary hospital in Switzerland. Patients were followed up six weeks postpartum. Patient and procedure characteristics, past morbidity or traumatic events, psychosocial status and stressful perinatal events were measured. Outcome was divided into two categories: full PTSD disease and PTSD profile. This was based on the number of DSM-IV criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) present. The PTSD Checklist Scale and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale were used for measurement. Results: Of the 280 patients included, 217 (77.5%) answered the questionnaires and 175 (62.5%) answered to an additional phone interview. Twenty (9.2%) had a PTSD profile and six (2.7%) a PTSD. When a full predictive model of risk factors for PTSD profile was built using logistic regression, maternal prepartum and intrapartum complications, anaesthetic complications and dissociative experiences during C-section were found to be the significant predictors for PTSD profile. Conclusion: This is the first study to show in parturients having a C-section that an anaesthesia complication is an independent risk factor for postpartum PTSD and PTSD profile development, in addition to known perinatal and maternal risk factors.

Despite the high rates of Cesarean section worldwide, the incidence of CPSP and the risk factors for this condition remain relatively unknown. The objective of this study was to calculate the incidence of CPSP in women submitted to Cesarean section and to analyze the associated risk factors. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort of 621 women undergoing Cesarean section was recruited preoperatively. Potential presurgical (sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle-related characteristics) and post-surgical risk factors (the presence and intensity of pain) risk factors were analyzed. Pain was measured at 24 hours and 7, 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery. Following discharge from hospital, data were collected by telephone. The outcome measure was self-reported pain three months after a Cesarean section. The risk factors for chronic pain were analyzed using the log-binomial regression model (a generalized linear model). Results: A total of 462 women were successfully contacted 90 days following surgery. The incidence of CPSP was 25.5% (95%CI: 21.8-29.7). Risk factors included presurgical anxiety (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.03; 95%CI: 1.01-1.05), smoking (adjusted RR 2.22; 95%CI: 1.27-3.88) and severe pain in the early postoperative period (adjusted RR 2.79; 95%CI: 1.29-6.00). Conclusion: One in four women submitted to Cesarean section may develop CPSP; however, the risk factors identified here are modifiable and preventable. Preventive strategies directed towards controlling anxiety, reducing smoking during pregnancy and managing pain soon after hospital discharge are recommended.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate relationship between type of delivery and maternal depression, between 6 to 16 months after childbirth. We performed a prospective cohort study of 558 low-socioeconomic status pregnant women without depression. All participants were recruited from primary care clinics of the public sector in three administrative districts in the Western area of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Type of delivery was classified as uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery (UVD) (no episiotomy and no more than a first-degree perineal laceration), complicated vaginal delivery (CVD) (episiotomy or more than a second-degree perineal laceration), and cesarean delivery (CD). Data about type of delivery were extracted from medical charts. Crude and adjusted risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance estimates to examine the association between type of delivery with maternal depression.

Results showed that post-traumatic stress symptoms were more frequently observed in black women and in women who had a higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared to those with a lower BMI. Women who have a history of mental illness as well as those who gave birth before arriving at the hospital, underwent an emergency caesarean section or experienced severe maternal morbidity or neonatal complications also showed symptoms. Women's perceived control during labour and birth significantly reduced the effects of some risk factors. A higher level of perceived social support during the postnatal period also reduced the risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms. From the perspective of clinical practice, improving women's sense of control during labour and birth appears to be important, as does providing social support following the birth.

Women's preferences may vary across countries for psychosocial or obstetric reasons. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 6549 women in routine antenatal care giving birth in Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway or Sweden. Preference for mode of birth was self-reported in mid-pregnancy. Birth outcome data were collected from hospital records. Results: A CS was preferred by 3.5% of primiparous women and 8.7% of the multiparous women. Preference for CS was associated with severe fear of childbirth (FOC), with a negative birth experience in multiparous women and with depressive symptoms in the primiparous. Women were somewhat more prone to prefer a cesarean in Iceland, odd ratio (OR) 1.70 (1.02-2.83), adjusted for age, education, depression, FOC, history of abuse, previous cesarean and negative birth experience. Out of the 404 women who preferred CS during pregnancy, 286 (70.8%) delivered by CS, mostly for a medical indication. A total of 9% of the cesareans in the cohort had a non-medical indication only. Conclusions: Women's preference for CS often seems to be due to health concerns. Both medical and psychological factors need to be addressed in antenatal counseling. Obstetricians need to convey accurately to women the risks and benefits of CS in her specific case. Maternity professionals should identify and explore psychosocial reasons for women's preferences.

Methods: A prospective cohort of 229 primiparous women was recruited antenatally from a public and a private maternity hospital, Melbourne, Australia, between 2009 and 2011. Data were collected by self-report questionnaires at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. Main outcome measures were a checklist of maternal health symptoms and a standardized assessment of fatigue symptoms. Results: Birth-related pain was common at week 1 (n = 80/88, 91% cesarean delivery pain; n = 92/125, 74% perineal pain), and still present for one in five women who had a cesarean birth (n = 17, 18%) at week 8. Back pain was reported by approximately half the sample at each study interval, with 25 percent (n = 48) reporting a later onset at week 2 or beyond. Fatigue was not relieved between 4 and 8 weeks. Conclusions: Women experience significant morbidity in the early weeks postpartum, the extent of which may have been underestimated in previous research relying on retrospective recall. Findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that supports early identification, treatment, and support for women's physical health problems in the postpartum.

It is unknown if a larger infant head circumference or smaller maternal perineal anatomy are risk factors for perineal trauma after vaginal delivery. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of low-risk nulliparous women. Data collected included maternal characteristics, antepartum Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification measurements of the perineal body and genital hiatus, labor characteristics, perineal trauma, and infant head circumference. Perineal trauma was defined as trauma that extended into the muscles of the perineum (second-degree or deeper). Univariate and multivariate logistic models were created to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI). Results We observed 448 vaginal births. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between infant head circumference at birth and perineal trauma: OR 1.22 for each increase of 1 cm in head circumference (95% CI 1.05-1.43). There was no association between perineal body or genital hiatus length and perineal trauma. Conclusions In nulliparous low-risk women a larger infant head circumference at birth increases the likelihood of perineal trauma, although the effect is modest. Antenatal perineal body and genital hiatus measurements do not predict perineal trauma. These results do not support alteration in mode of delivery or other obstetric practices.

Only a few large population-based studies of PPD have used clinical diagnoses of depression and no study has examined how a maternal depression history interacts with known risk factors. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of a depression history on PPD and pre- and perinatal risk factors. Methods: A nationwide prospective cohort study of all women with live singleton births in Sweden from 1997 through 2008 was conducted. Relative risk (RR) of clinical depression within the first year postpartum and two-sided 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Results: The RR of PPD in women with a history of depression was estimated at 21.03 (confidence interval: 19.72-22.42), compared to those without. Among all women, PPD risk increased with advanced age (1.25 (1.13-1.37)) and gestational diabetes (1.70 (1.36-2.13)). Among women with a history of depression, pregestational diabetes (1.49 (1.01-2.21)) and mild preterm delivery also increased risk (1.20 (1.06-1.36)). Among women with no depression history, young age (2.14 (1.79-2.57)), undergoing instrument-assisted (1.23 (1.09-1.38)) or cesarean (1.64(1.07- 2.50)) delivery, and moderate preterm delivery increased risk (1.36 (1.05-1.75)). Rates of PPD decreased considerably after the first postpartum month (RR = 0.27). Conclusion: In the largest population-based study to date, the risk of PPD was more than 20 times higher for women with a depression history, compared to women without. Gestational diabetes was independently associated with a modestly increased PPD risk. Maternal depression history also had a modifying effect on pre- and perinatal PPD risk factors.

Perioperative data were collected and specialized questionnaires were completed to assess reports of pain at the site of surgery. Three dependent outcomes were considered: pain at the third month after surgery (M3, n = 268; risk = 28%), pain at the sixth month after surgery (M6, n = 239; risk = 19%), and the cumulative incidence (up to M6) of neuropathic pain, as assessed using the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire (n = 218; risk = 24.5%). The neuropathic aspect of reported pain changed over time in more than 60% of cases, pain being more intense if associated with neuropathic features. Whatever the dependent outcome, a high mental component of quality of life (SF-36) was protective. Pain at M3 was also predicted by pain reported during current pregnancy and a history of miscarriage. Pain at M6 was also predicted by report of a postoperative complication. Incident neuropathic pain was predicted by pain reported during current pregnancy, a previous history of a peripheral neuropathic event, and preoperative anxiety. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00812734. Perspective: Persistent pain after cesarean delivery has a relatively frequent neuropathic aspect but this is less stable than that after other surgeries. When comparing the risk factor analyses with published data for hysterectomy, the influence of preoperative psychological factors seems less important, possibly because of the different context and environment.

Methods: A prospective cohort study of 1,000 women in Accra, Ghana (2012-2014), was conducted. Women were classified as having overweight (BMI 25-30) and obesity (BMI >=30), and their obstetric and infant outcomes were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: The analysis included 824 women, average 28 years (SD 5.1); 313 (31.3%) had overweight and 169 (16.9%) obesity. Women with obesity had a two-fold increased risk for cesarean sections (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.21-4.02) and more than a six-fold higher risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension (RR 6.17, 95% CI 2.90-13.13) and chronic hypertension (RR 6.00, 95% CI 1.40-25.76). Infants of women with overweight or obesity were more likely to be macrosomic (RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.13-4.97). Conclusions: The global obesity epidemic has reached women in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with important adverse consequences for maternal and infant health.

Our hypothesis was that the delivery mode may influence mainly the naive T cell subpopulation. Aims: Particular focus was set on the proportions and peripheral replicative history of naive T cells and cord blood serum concentrations of IL-7, a cytokine involved in peripheral naive T cell homeostasis. Study design, subjects and outcome measures: In a prospective cohort study, proportions of lymphocyte populations were measured in mothers and newborns delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery (SD), vacuum extraction (VE), primary (PCS) and secondary Cesarean sections (SCS) by flow cytometry. T-cell-receptor-excision-circles (TRECs) and relative telomere lengths (RTLs) were used to estimate the replicative history of peripheral naive T cells. The cytokine profile was assessed by ELISA. Results: The study demonstrated that leukocytes, neutrophils and NK cells were increased in spontaneously delivered newborns compared to PCS, whereas circulating T cells were relatively lower. TRECs and RTLs were not significantly influenced by the delivery mode. IL-2, IL-8 and IFN-g were increased in VD. IL-7 production tends to be increased in more stress-associated delivery modes, such as VE and SCS. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate proportional changes in newborns delivered by PCS and diminished cytokine production. It has to be proven whether these alterations may be of disadvantage regarding early defense of infectious diseases. Understanding the physiological role of these changes may help to find preventive strategies for neonatal infectious risks and the development of atopy or other immune diseases.

These women have been shown to be more vulnerable to post-partum depression. This study aimed to identify factors for predicting post-partum depressive symptoms during hospitalization after childbirth in Japanese primiparas aged 35 years and over. Methods: The present authors used the data of 479 primiparas aged 35 years and over from a prospective cohort study. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires on the day before hospital discharge. The questionnaire consisted of: demographics and background information; depressive symptoms; fatigue; maternal confidence and maternal satisfaction; child-care values; physical symptoms; perceptions of daily life during hospitalization; concerns about child care and daily life; and infant feeding. Additionally, vital records data were obtained from the hospitals. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed on the binary outcome variable of depressive symptoms, measured by the Japanese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Women who scored 9 or more were considered to be at high risk for post-partum depression. The authors obtained informed consent from all participants and institutional ethics approvals before initiating the study. Results: The following six variables reliably predicted the risk of post-partum depression: emergency cesarean section, lower satisfaction with birth experience, higher physical burden in daily life, long-term complications with the newborn, more concerns about newborn caretaking after discharge, and more concerns about one's own life after discharge. Conclusion: Recognition of women with these factors will help nurses to identify those at risk for developing post-partum depression and to provide appropriate care during hospitalization after childbirth.

Besides perioperative data collection, postoperative postal questionnaires built to assess the existence, intensity, and neuropathic features (with the Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions [DN4]) of pain at the site of surgery were sent at the third and sixth months after surgery. In the 2,397 patients who completed follow-up, the cumulative risk of N-PSPP within the 6 months ranged from 3.2% (laparoscopic herniorrhaphy) to 37.1% (breast cancer surgery). Pain intensity was greater if DN4 was positive and decreased with time since surgery; it depended on the type of surgery. In pain-reporting patients, the response to the DN4 changed from time to time in about 1:4 of the cases. Older age and a low anxiety score were independent protective factors of N-PSPP, whereas a recent negative event, a low preoperative quality of life, and previous history of peripheral neuropathy were risk factors.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for 6 months and recently extended its recommendation for continuing to breastfeed with supplementation of solid foods from one to two years. Studies consistently identify lower breastfeeding rates among US infants, with regional and demographic variability. We examined breastfeeding in birthing person-infant pairs among healthy, term pregnancies enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study between 2010 and 2017 (n = 1176). Methods Birthing persons 18-45 years old were enrolled during prenatal care visits at ~ 24-28 weeks gestation and have been followed since enrollment. Breastfeeding status was obtained from postpartum questionnaires. Birthing person and infant health and sociodemographic information was abstracted from medical records and prenatal and postpartum questionnaires. We evaluated the effects of birthing person age, education, relationship status, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain (GWG), smoking and parity, and infant sex, ponderal index, gestational age and delivery mode on breastfeeding initiation and duration using modified Poisson and multivariable linear regression. Results Among healthy, term pregnancies, 96% of infants were breastfed at least once. Only 29% and 28% were exclusively breastfed at 6-months or received any breastmilk at 12-months, respectively. Higher birthing person age, education, and parity, being married, excessive GWG, and older gestational age at delivery were associated with better breastfeeding outcomes. Smoking, obesity, and cesarean delivery were negatively associated with breastfeeding outcomes. Conclusions Given the public health importance of breastfeeding for infants and birthing persons, interventions are needed to support birthing persons to extend their breastfeeding duration. Significance What is already known? The benefits of breastfeeding to child and birthing person health are well-documented, however, rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration continue to fall short of health-based guidelines. Regional differences exist and certain rural New England states tend to have amongst the highest breastfeeding rates in the US. What this study adds? This study of n = 1176 birthing persons-infant pairs enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, a rural, general population pregnancy cohort, suggests that factors influencing breastfeeding outcomes align closely with studies conducted in urban settings and using nationally-representative surveys.

Methods: We analysed data gathering from the Massachusetts General Hospital Maternal Child Cohort (MMCC) of children born between 1998 and 2016. Data included the mode of delivery, maternal pregnancy and their offspring characteristics. We searched for CD cases by using diagnosis billing codes. Cox proportional hazard regression models were created to identify variables associated with CD. Results: We identified 44 539 mother-child pairs who had at least one encounter by 5 years old and identified 173 children (0.4%) with CD diagnosis; median age at the diagnosis was 6 years.

The study's aim was to identify predictive and protective factors for in-hospital formula supplementation in individuals documented as wanting to exclusively breastfeed and residing in a geographic region with adverse social determinants of health and low breastfeeding rates. Additionally, we wished to determine if lactation consultation served as a protective factor against supplementation. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we retrospectively reviewed 500 randomly selected charts of newborns born in a 12 month period at a regional tertiary care hospital. We included healthy, full-term neonates having a recorded maternal decision to exclusively breastfeed. Maternal-newborn dyad characteristics were compared between those exclusively breastfeeding and those with in-hospital formula supplementation. Results Of the 500 charts, 70% of individuals desired to exclusively breastfeed. Overall, 41% of breastfed newborns were supplemented with formula before discharge, and 32% of women met with lactation consultants prior to supplementation. No statistically significant association was present between exclusive breastfeeding at discharge and meeting with a hospital lactation consultant (p = 0.55). When controlling for the confounders of maternal demographics and lactation consultation, significant associations with formula supplementation included Cesarean delivery (odd ratio: 2.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-4.16), primiparity (2.48, 1.27-4.87), and high school level of education (2.78, 1.33-5.78). Conclusions Maternal characteristics of high school level educational, primiparity, and Caesarean delivery place individuals at risk for in-hospital formula supplementation in individuals wishing to exclusively breastfeed. Addressing barriers to exclusive breastfeeding is essential to enhance maternal and newborn health equity.

M., W.;van Pampus, Maria, G.;van den Heuvel, Odile, A.;Broekman, Birit F., P.","Background: Studies have identified adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes for women with psychiatric disorders. Additionally, psychiatric disorders may pose an increased risk for unintended pregnancies (UPs) which in turn may also impact negatively on outcomes. The present study aims to compare the incidence of UPs in women with versus without current/past psychiatric diagnoses and investigates whether psychiatric history modifies the relation between delivery outcomes in women with and without UPs. Methods: A retrospective cohort was compiled of women who gave birth in a large hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Women >=18 years old with singleton pregnancies and birth registrations in the electronic patient file during January 1, 2015 to March 1, 2020 were included. Patient characteristics (including pregnancy intention and psychiatric history), maternal (gestational diabetes, mode of delivery) and neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age [GA], birthweight and Apgar scores) were registered by health care providers in hospital charts. Incidence of UPs was compared between women with versus without current/past psychiatric diagnoses. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between women with versus without UPs with linear or logistic regression models adjusted for relevant confounders with an interaction term for UP with current/past psychiatric diagnoses. Results: We included 1219 women with and 1093 women without current/ past psychiatric diagnoses. Current/past psychiatric diagnoses were significantly associated with UPs after adjustment for confounders (39.0% vs. 29.6%, OR 1.56, CI 1.23-2.00, p < 0.001). In sub-analyses, women with depressive (OR 1.67, CI 1.24-2.26, p = 0.001), personality (OR 2.64, CI 1.38-5.11, p = 0.004) and substance-related and addictive disorders (OR 4.29, CI 1.90- 10.03, p = 0.001) had higher odds of UPs compared to women without current/past psychiatric diagnoses. Amongst women with UPs, current/past psychiatric diagnoses did not modify maternal or neonatal outcomes, except for GA at delivery as women with both UPs and current/past psychiatric diagnosis had a 2.21-day higher mean GA at delivery than women in the reference group (p-value interaction = 0.001). Conclusions: Current/past psychiatric diagnoses are associated with a higher odd of UPs. In our sample, maternal and neonatal outcomes were comparable for women with and without UPs and these results were similar for women with and without current/past psychiatric diagnoses, except for GA at delivery. Although our study is limited by several factors, we found that women with current/past psychiatric diagnoses, irrespective of pregnancy planning status, do not have more adverse maternal or pregnancy outcomes. Increased efforts are needed to ensure that psychoeducation and conversations about pregnancy planning and UPs are available for women with current/past psychiatric diagnoses.

Additionally, we sought to examine modification by the scheduled status of the cesarean.Study DesignWe used data from a multi-site cohort study of patients who delivered in 2018-2019 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Illinois, MetroHealth Medical System in Ohio, or University of Alabama at Birmingham in Alabama. All patients had permanent contraception as their contraceptive plan in their medical chart during delivery hospitalization. We used logistic regression to model the association between insurance type, scheduled status of cesarean and permanent contraception fulfillment by hospital discharge. The scheduled status of cesarean delivery was examined as an effect modifier.ResultsCompared to patients with private insurance, those with Medicaid were less likely to have their desired permanent contraception procedure fulfilled by hospital discharge (89.3% vs. 96.8%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for covariates, patients with Medicaid had a lower odds of permanent contraception fulfillment by hospital discharge (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.77). This association was stronger among those who had unscheduled cesarean deliveries (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.74) than those with scheduled cesarean deliveries (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.88).Conclusions for PracticeCompared to patients with private insurance undergoing a cesarean delivery, those with Medicaid insurance were less likely to have their desired permanent contraception fulfilled. Physicians and hospitals must examine their practices surrounding Medicaid forms to ensure that patients have valid consent forms available at the time of delivery.

There is a lack of research focusing on social, linguistic, and medical factors related to being DHH which may identify groups of DHH people who experience more inequity. OBJECTIVE: Examine difference in prevalence of cesarean and adverse birth outcomes among diverse sub-groups of DHH people. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of DHH birthing people in the U.S. who gave birth within the past 10 years. The sample was predominantly white, college educated, and married. We assessed cesarean birth and three adverse birth outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, and NICU admission post-delivery. DHH-specific variables were genetic etiology of hearing loss, preferred language (i.e., American Sign Language, English, or bilingual), severity of hearing loss, age of onset of hearing loss, and self-reported quality of perinatal care communication. We estimated prevalence, 95 % confidence intervals, and unadjusted prevalence ratios. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of our sample reported a cesarean birth. Overall, there were no significant differences in prevalence across the outcome variables with respect to preferred language, genetic etiology, severity, and age of onset. Poorer perinatal care communication quality was associated with higher prevalence of preterm birth (PR = 2.37) and NICU admission (PR = 1.91). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found no evidence supporting differences in obstetric outcomes among DHH birthing people across medical factors related to deafness. Findings support the important role of communication access for DHH people in healthcare environments.

The present study was conducted to determine the relationship between spiritual health and anxiety and fear of childbirth in pregnant women. This correlational cross-sectional study was performed on 426 pregnant women who were referred to Yahyanejad Hospital in Babol, Iran, during 2018-2021. These pregnant women were hospitalized in the maternity ward for vaginal delivery. Convenience sampling bases on inclusion criteria were done to select the subjects. The questionnaires used in this study included Demographic and Obstetric Questionnaire, Anxiety and Fear of Childbirth Questionnaire by Pirdel et al., and Palutzian & Ellison Spiritual Well-being Scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 using descriptive and analytical indicators and linear and multiple correlation tests. The results of the study showed that all pregnant women experienced moderate (23.1) or severe (76.9) fear and anxiety, and none of the women had low fear and anxiety. Moreover, all women in this study had moderate (50.5) or high (49.5) spiritual health. The results of linear regression test showed that there is a significant and inverse relationship between spiritual health and anxiety and fear of childbirth (R: - 0.12, CI - 0.14, - 0.019, P = 0.011). Furthermore, the results of multivariate linear regression test after adjustments for intervening demographic and midwifery variables showed a significant relationship between spiritual health (R: - 0.12, CI - 0.14, - 0.02, P = 0.009), education level and number of pregnancies, and anxiety and fear of childbirth. The results of the study showed that with the increase in spiritual health, anxiety and fear of childbirth decreases. Therefore, it can be inferred that women need spiritual care in addition to medical care to deal with fear and anxiety during pregnancy and childbirth.

Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional vital records data on singleton live births in Louisiana (2016-2022). Same-sex relationships (SSR) vs. different-sex relationships (DSR) were classified based on the sex of the parents listed on the birth certificate. Using modified Poisson regression, we estimated adjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals among birthing persons in SSR vs. DSR for preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), spontaneous labor, Cesarean delivery, gestational hypertension, and gestational diabetes. We examined within and across group disparities in models stratified by sexual orientation and race/ethnicity. Results: In the total birthing population, those in SSR experienced higher risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes and were less likely to have spontaneous labor compared with persons in DSR. The risk of PTB and LBW was two-fold higher among Black birthing people in SSR compared with White birthing people in SSR and DSR. Latine birthing people in SSR experienced higher risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes compared with their peers in DSR and White people in DSR. Some of these disparities were partially explained by including socioeconomic and health risk factors. Conclusion: Sexual orientation-related disparities exist across and within racial/ethnic groups among birthing people in Louisiana. Adopting an intersectional approach that considers the mutually constituted nature of heterosexism and racism is critical to addressing sexual orientation-related inequities in reproductive and perinatal health.

The Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised (BSS-R) is a brief and psychometrically robust multi-dimensional self-report tool designed to assess birth experience. The current investigation sought to translate and validate a Czech Republic version of the BSS-R (CZ-BSS-R). Methods: Following translation psychometric assessment of the CZ-BSS-R was undertaken using a cross-sectional design. A between-subjects design was incorporated in order to evaluate known-groups validity evaluation of the translated measure. Four hundred and sixty-five Czech-speaking women within the Czech Republic took part in the study. Confirmatory factor analysis was undertaken and divergent and convergent validity and internal consistency characteristics also evaluated. Results: The CZ-BSS-R was observed to have excellent psychometric properties and conceptually and measurement faithful to the original English-language measure. Consistent with previous investigations using the BSS-R significant differences were found in scores as a function of delivery type. Conclusions: The CZ-BSS-R is a valid, robust and reliable measure of birth experience and suitable for use with Czech-speaking women in the Czech Republic. The study highlighted that instrument and emergency Caesarean section were associated with a lower level of birth satisfaction compared to vaginal delivery.

Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted by distribution of an open anonymous questionnaire on social media platforms during March 2022, targeting respondents with a history of cesarean delivery. The primary outcome was patients' experience of 'being disturbed by professional and casual conversations of the personnel', rated on a 1-5 Likert scale. Results 1203 participants completed the questionnaire, with 97.6% reporting intraoperative conversations among personnel. Casual conversations were perceived as 'disturbing' by more respondents vs. professional talk (33.4% vs. 27.6%, respectively, p = 0.0077). Logistic regression analysis revealed associations between feeling disturbed and higher intraoperative stress and pain - adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-4.5, and OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.8-4.0, respectively, for professional conversations; OR 3.0, 95%CI 2.0-4.4, and OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.1-2.7, respectively, for casual conversations. Feeling disturbed by professional conversations was also associated with urgent vs. elective operations (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.4-3.0). Direct personnel-patient communication was associated with significantly lower stress levels (60.8% vs. 72.5% in the remaining cohort, p < 0.001). Discussion Intraoperative conversations of the personnel occur during vast majority of cesarean deliveries. Given that a substantial proportion of patients find these conversations disturbing, it is advisable to conduct a preliminary assessment of maternal preferences. This proactive step can help tailor communication strategies to individual patient comfort and preferences, ultimately enhancing the birthing experience and maternal well-being.

Methods: A longitudinal cohort study with 3009 first-time mothers giving birth in Ireland collected physical and mental health data in pregnancy and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum. Mental health was measured using the depression and anxiety subscales of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Experience of eight common physical health issues (e.g. severe headaches/migraines, back pain) were assessed in pregnancy, with an additional six assessed at each postpartum data collection point. Results: 2.4 % of women reported depression alone in pregnancy and 4 % reported depression across the first postpartum year. Anxiety alone was reported by 3.0 % of women in pregnancy, and 2 % in the first year postpartum. Prevalence of comorbid anxiety/depression (CAD) was 1.5 % in pregnancy and almost 2 % postpartum. A higher proportion of women reporting, compared to women not reporting, postpartum CAD were younger, not partnered, not in paid employment in pregnancy, have fewer years of education, and had a caesarean birth. Extreme tiredness/exhaustion and back pain were the most common physical health issues in pregnancy and postpartum. Constipation, haemorrhoids, bowel issues, breast issues, infection and pain in the perineum or caesarean wound, pelvic pain and urinary tract infections were highest at three months postpartum and gradually decreased thereafter. Women reporting depression alone or anxiety alone were equivalent in terms of physical health issues. However, women without mental health symptoms reported significantly fewer physical health issues than women reporting depressive or anxiety symptoms alone or CAD at every time point. Women with CAD reported a significantly higher number of health issues than women reporting depression alone or anxiety alone at 9 and 12 months postpartum. Conclusion: Reports of mental health symptoms are associated with higher physical health burden demonstrating a need for integrated approaches in mental and physical health care pathways in perinatal services.

This study aimed to examine the association between obstetric mode of delivery and emotional and behavioural problems in offspring aged 3-16 years.MethodsThe sample for this study comprised participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in the United Kingdom. The study cohort ranged from 7074 (at 3 years of age) to 4071 (at 16 years of age) mother-offspring pairs. Data on obstetric mode of delivery were abstracted from obstetric records by trained research midwives and classified as spontaneous vaginal delivery, assisted vaginal delivery and caesarean delivery (elective and emergency). Offspring emotional and behavioural problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when the child was 3, 7, 9, 11, and 16 years. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations.ResultsAssisted vaginal delivery was associated with an increased risk of emotional problems at age 11 years (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.11-1.81).

However, this practice is insufficient worldwide and the factors influencing it are still unknown. The study aimed at determining the proportion of pregnant women involved in shared decision-making and its associated factors in Dar es Salaam. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study among 350 pregnant women with one prior cesarean section. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire and SPSS 23 was used for analysis. A score of 80 or higher on the nine-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDMQ9) was used to calculate the proportion of women, and the associated factors were obtained using a logistic regression model. P value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The proportion of pregnant women involved in shared decision making was 38%. Factors that were significantly associated with sharing decision making were; having low level of education (AOR 0.55 95% CI 0.33-0.91), being married/having partner (AOR 2.58 95% CI 1.43-4.63), having a companion who had active participation (AOR 3.31 95% CI 1.03-10.6) and being familiar with the clinician (AOR 5.01 95% CI 1.30-19.2). Conclusion: To promote practice of shared decision making in our setting, encouragement of socially vulnerable pregnant women's participation in decision-making by health care professionals, encouragement of companion participation during antenatal care and promotion of personal continuity of care to improve familiarity to clinicians are needed.

Both low- and high-risk groups adopted preventive approaches such as mask-wearing and handwashing to slow down and prevent viral transmission during critical periods that may affect mother-child interactions.MethodsA longitudinal observational study was conducted with primiparous women recruited using convenience sampling from the postpartum care ward of Afzalipour Teaching Hospital in Kerman from August 1, 2020 to March 30, 2021. The research questionnaires included demographic information, preventive behaviors, breastfeeding intention and practices, postpartum distress, and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. All the questionnaires were self-reported online in three stages: before discharge from the postpartum ward, the first month after delivery, and the third month after delivery.ResultsA Total of 160 primiparous women were included. The results showed significant changes in preventive behaviors and postpartum distress levels during the study. Breastfeeding intention and practices were negatively affected by postpartum distress (P = 0.034), unwanted pregnancies (P = 0.009), and cesarean delivery (P < 0.001). Postpartum distress was directly affected by the presence of depression (P < 0.001). Preventive behaviors at discharge were significantly associated with postpartum distress three months after delivery (P = 0.013). The study also found an association between women's and partner's education, unwanted pregnancy, and cesarean delivery that determined postpartum distress.ConclusionsPandemic restrictions did not affect breastfeeding intentions or practices, possibly due to sufficient social and family support during the pandemic. However, robust guidelines are required to increase enable women's access to specializede care to cope with future pandemics, particularly during the first few weeks after childbirth.

Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study among 2,059,578 non-malformed singleton live-births in Sweden born 1983-2004. Using national registries with prospectively recorded information, we followed participants for a BPD diagnosis from 13 up to 34 years of age. We compared BPD risks between exposure categories using hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from adjusted Cox models. We also conducted sibling-controlled analyses among 1,467,819 full siblings. Results: There were 14,998 BPD diagnoses. Risk of BPD was 0.74% through 25 years of age.

Methods Data for this case-control study was collected from June 2019 till February 2020. All women in the Gynecology Department of Lady Willingdon Hospital, Lahore, who had delivered a baby within the last 24 h were invited to participate. Women who delivered babies less than 2.5 kg were considered as 'cases' (having low birth weight - LBW - infants) and those having babies of 2.5 kg or more were categorized as 'controls' (normal birth weight infants). The selected sample was matched for age, general health (indicated by mean upper arm circumference) and Hemoglobin levels. Intraoral examination was conducted and gingival color and appearance; calculus, bleeding on probing, CPITN (Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs) and CAL (clinical attachment loss) were recorded.

Here, we examined this association by exploiting a large dataset. Methods: Participants were 65,235 mothers participating in the Japan Environment and Children's Study, an ongoing nationwide birth cohort. Outcome variables were parenting stress assessed as total score and subscale scores (representing the difficult child, parental distress, and spouse factors) on the Japanese 19-item version of the Parenting Stress Index Short Form (J-PSI-SF). Exposures were the mode of delivery, the timing of the J-PSI-SF assessment (1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 years postpartum), and the interaction between them. Multivariate regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted b coefficients and standard error of the means (SEMs). Results: The J-PSI-SF total score was higher in the cesarean section group than in the vaginal delivery group (adjusted b = 0.24, SEM = 0.09). This increase was primarily due to higher scores for the difficult child factor (adjusted b = 0.18, SEM = 0.05) and not to higher scores for the parental distress or spouse factor. Conclusions: Cesarean section was associated with higher parenting stress, especially in relation to the difficult child factor.

Methods: Using UK Biobank cohort, the logistic regression model was first applied to evaluate the associations of adult anxiety and self-harm with birth by CS. Using birth by CS as exposure variables, genome-wide by environment interaction study (GWEIS) was then applied by PLINK2.0 to identify associated genes interacting with birth by CS for anxiety and self-harm. Results: In the observational study, significant associations were observed between birth by CS and anxiety (odds ratio (OR) = 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-1.38; P = 4.86 x 10-5), and self-harm (OR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.24; P = 2.90 x 10-2). GWEIS revealed multiple suggestive genes interacted with birth by CS for anxiety, such as DKK2 (rs13137764, P = 1.24 x 10-9, adjusted P = 2.68 x 10-7) and ATXN1 (rs62389045, P = 4.38 x 10-8, adjusted P = 3.55 x 10-6). For self-harm, significant gene-environment interactions of birth by CS on self-harm were detected, such as ALDH1A2 (rs77828167, P = 1.62 x 10-8; rs116899929, P = 1.92 x 10-8) and DAB1 (rs116124269, P = 3.20 x 10-8; rs191070006, P = 3.63 x 10-8). Conclusions: Our results suggested that birth by CS was associated with the risk of adult anxiety and self-harm. We also discovered some genes interacted with birth by CS might influence the risk of anxiety and self-harm, which may provide novel clues for the pathogenesis of those mental disorders.

During late pregnancy, mothers showed lower cortical volume than controls across all functional networks. These cortical differences attenuated in the early postpartum session. Default mode and frontoparietal networks showed below-expected volume increases during peripartum, suggesting that their reductions may persist longer. Results also pointed to different cortical trajectories in mothers who delivered by scheduled C-section. The main findings were replicated in an independent sample of 29 mothers and 24 nulliparous women.

Without adequate care or prevention, this frequently results in adulthood-long distress and impairment at large societal costs. Determining the prevalence of ADHD cases among preschoolers as well as some associated maternal and child risk factors was the aim of this study. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study including 1048 preschool children aged 3-6 years was carried out in Tanta City, Gharbia Governorate. From March to April 2022, a proportionate stratified cluster random sample of them was picked. Data were gathered using a predesigned instrument that included sociodemographic information, family history, maternal and child risk factors, and the Arabic version of the ADHD Rating Scale IV questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of ADHD among preschoolers was 10.5%. The inattention type was the most common (5.3%), followed by the hyperactivity type (3.4%). There were statistically significant associations regarding positive family history of psychological and neurological symptoms (17.9% positive vs. 9.7% negative), family history of ADHD symptoms (24.5% positive vs. 9.4% negative), active smoking by the mother (21.1% positive vs. 5.3% negative), cesarean section delivery (66.4% positive vs. 53.9% negative), elevated blood pressure during pregnancy (19.1% positive vs. 12.4% negative), and history of taking drugs during pregnancy (43.6% positive vs. 31.7% negative). Significant child risk factors were: exposure to any source containing lead that causes slow poisoning (25.5% positive vs. 12.3% negative), children with cardiac health problems (38.2% positive vs. 16.6% negative), and hours spent by a child in front of the TV or mobile phone (any screens) per day (60.0% of those with positive screening spent more than 2 h/day vs. 45.7% negative). Conclusion: In the Gharbia governorate, 10.5% of preschoolers suffer from ADHD. Significant maternal risk factors for ADHD included a positive family history of psychiatric and neurological symptoms, a family history of ADHD symptoms, active maternal smoking, caesarean section delivery, increased blood pressure during pregnancy, and a history of drug use during pregnancy. Youngsters who had cardiac health issues and who spent more time each day watching TV or using a mobile device (screen use) were at substantial risk.

Studies have demonstrated an association between antipsychotic medications and metabolic problems such as weight gain and diabetes mellitus in non-pregnant patients with psychiatric disorders. GDM increases the risk of adverse maternal outcomes, including pregnancy-induced hypertension, antepartum and postpartum haemorrhage, and caesarean delivery. The National Register of Antipsychotic Medication in Pregnancy (NRAMP) is a prospective Australian cohort study that observed women who took antipsychotics during pregnancy. Data from 205 women were extracted for the final analysis and included women who took first or second-generation antipsychotics (FGA,SGA) during the first trimester of pregnancy (at minimum) and had a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (n = 180). The comparison (non-exposed) group (n = 25) were women with psychosis who chose not to take any antipsychotic during the first trimester (at minimum). The comparison groups were not matched, although groups were homogenous in terms of sex, age range, diagnosis and perinatal status. The results of logistic regression analysis revealed that women who were exposed to FGAs, SGAs were seven and five times, respectively, more likely to develop GDM compared to non-exposed groups. When adjusted for confounding variables such as BMI and family history of diabetes, the potential of developing GDM decreased for women taking SGAs. In conclusion, the risk of developing GDM is lower in women taking SGAs compared with women taking FDAs. In addition, family history of diabetes and BMI adds to the risk.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study of all live-born infants at our academic research institution from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016, was conducted. EMR data were used to determine whether each infant received mother's own milk (MOM), PDHM, or formula. These data were stratified based on whether the infant received treatment in the Neonatal Critical Care Center. Generalized estimating equation models were used to calculate the odds of receiving PDHM by maternal race-ethnicity, adjusting for gestational age, birth weight, insurance, preferred language, nulliparity, and mode of delivery. Results: Infant feeding data were available for 7097 infants, of whom 49% were fed only MOM during their postpartum hospitalization. Among the 15.9% of infants admitted to neonatal critical care, infants of non-Hispanic Black (odds ratio [OR] 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.72), Hispanic (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36-1019), and Other (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32-1.26) mothers had lower rates of PDHM feedings than infants of non-Hispanic White mothers in the adjusted models. Among well infants, the use of PDHM was lower among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic mothers (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.18-0.36, and OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26-0.56) compared with non- Hispanic White mothers. Conclusions: Inequities in exclusive human milk feeding and use of PDHM by maternal race-ethnicity were identified. Antiracist interventions are needed to promote equitable access to skilled lactation support and counseling for PDHM use.

This study evaluated whether maternal MG is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. Methods: We conducted a nationwide Swedish register-based cohort study of women who gave birth to singleton infants (>=22 gestational weeks) during 1987-2019. Exposed women were diagnosed with MG before or during the index pregnancy (N = 443). Unexposed women comprised 4249 women without a diagnosis of MG, matched for age, parity, hospital, and year of childbirth. The risks of adverse pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes for women with MG were estimated using regression modeling and presented as adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Results: There was no increased risk of pregnancy complications in women with MG. Women with MG had a spontaneous onset of labor less often than women without MG (69.8% vs. 79.5%; aOR 0.59; p < 0.001) as well as higher labor induction rates and elective cesarean section deliveries (16.0% vs. 12.3%, aOR 1.42; p = 0.02 and 12.0% vs. 8.1%, aOR 1.59; p = 0.009). Infants of women with MG were born on average 2 days earlier (p = 0.002); however, these infants did not have a higher risk of having low APGAR, being small for gestational age, or having a congenital malformation. Conclusion: This first nationwide study of pregnancy in women with MG in Sweden demonstrates reassuring results overall, suggesting generally safe pregnancy outcomes for women with MG and their infants.

Methods: Nationwide Danish cohort study of 2,196,687 births was conducted between 1980 and 2015, with 38.5 million observation-years. Exposure was 'Caesarean Section' and outcome was the child's risk of any mental disorder. Absolute and relative risks (RRs) were estimated using inverse probability weighting to adjust for age, calendar time and confounding variables while accounting for the competing risk of death. Results: Caesarean section (n = 364,908, 16.6%), compared to vaginal birth, was associated with a small RR increase of 8% (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.13; n = 44,352) for the development of any in-patient psychiatric admission at age 36 for the offspring and with a small absolute risk difference of 0.47% (95% CI, 0.23-0.76). When looking at all in-patient, out-patient and emergency room psychiatric contacts among people born after 1995, the effect was diminished (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99-1.09; n = 15,211). The risk was comparable when comparing prelabour versus intrapartum caesarean section (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90-1.08) and acute versus planned caesarean section (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.29). Conclusion: Birth by caesarean section was associated with only a very slightly increased risk of any in-patient psychiatric admission for the offspring and diminished even further when including all psychiatric contacts. The very small associations observed may be explained by unmeasured confounding and is unlikely to be of substantial clinical relevance.

Despite the potential for this choice to influence women's mental health, evidence about the associated effect to counsel women and identify potential targets for intervention is limited. This study investigated the association between planned mode of birth after previous caesarean and women's subsequent use of psychotropic medications. Methods: A population-based cohort study of 31 131 women with one or more previous caesarean sections who gave birth to a term singleton in Scotland between 2010 and 2015 with no prior psychotropic medications in the year before birth was conducted using linked Scottish national datasets. Cox regression was used to investigate the association between planned mode of birth and being dispensed psychotropic medications in the first year postpartum adjusted for socio-demographic, medical, pregnancy-related factors and breastfeeding. Results: Planned VBAC (n = 10 220) compared to ERCS (n = 20 911) was associated with a reduced risk of the mother being dispensed any psychotropic medication [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.92], an antidepressant (aHR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.90), and at least two consecutive antidepressants (aHR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.91) in the first year postpartum. Conclusions: Women giving birth by ERCS were more likely than those having a planned VBAC to be dispensed psychotropic medication including antidepressants in the first year postpartum.

A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the association between C-section delivery and subsequent reproductive behaviour in women in India. Data were from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). The study sample comprised 255,726 currently married women in the age group of 15-49 years. The results showed a strong positive relationship between C-section births and female sterilization. The predicted probabilities (PP) from the multivariate regression model indicated a higher chance of female sterilization in women with C-section births (PP = 0.39, p<0.01) compared with those with non-C-section births (PP = 0.20, p<0.01). Both state-level correlation plots and Poisson regression estimates showed a strong negative relationship between C-section births and mean children ever born (CEB). Based on the results, it may be concluded that the use of C-sections and sterilization were strongly correlated in India at the time of the NFHS-4, thus together contributing to fertility decline. A strong negative association was found between the occurrence of C-sections and CEB. The increased and undesired use of C-section births and consequent female sterilization is a regressive socio-demographic process that often violates women's rights. Fertility decline should happen through informed choice of family planning and must protect the reproductive rights of women.

theeffectsofaccompanimentonmaternalanxietyduringelectivecesareandelivery:aquasi-experimentalstudy;2023;gutierrez,the effects of accompaniment on maternal anxiety during elective cesarean delivery: a quasi-experimental study,2023.0,"Gutierrez, Noemi, Obregon;Cobo, Jesus;Calsina, Salut, Puig;Esteve, Yolanda, Canet;Oliva, Joan, Carles;Tricas, Josefina, Goberna","Background In Spain, allowing women to be accompanied by their partners during cesarean deliveries is a poorly consolidated practice. Going through this experience alone, not only deprives women from the opportunity of sharing the birth with their partners, but also, forces them to face, on their own, one of the most stressful experiences during pregnancy. Objective To analyze whether significant differences exist in levels of anxiety of women who receive an elective cesarean delivery, according to whether they are allowed to be accompanied by their partners. Design Quasi-experimental, longitudinal, prospective study, comparing a group of 31 women receiving elective cesarean deliveries, without the presence of their partners, with a group of 33 women with elective cesarean deliveries who were accompanied by their partners. Anxiety levels were assessed using the STAI-State/Trait scale. Participants were given a questionnaire to assess their level of satisfaction with the care received. Results Anxiety measured via total scores on the STAI-S scale was significantly lower (p < 0.004) among the women who were accompanied by their partners during the elective cesarean delivery (median = 25), compared to the group who were not (median = 50). The differences were also significant (p < 0.003) considering the impact of accompaniment upon the group with high scores in the STAI-S (> 31) and continue to be significant when using the cut-off point of very high scores on the STAI-S (> 45). Conclusions Presence of partners during elective cesareans is a key factor for decreasing the anxiety caused by the surgery and for improving the overall experience of cesarean deliveries. Significance What is already known on this subject? Cesarean deliveries are one of the most stressful life experiences. Allowing women to be accompanied by their partners during cesarean deliveries is a poorly consolidated practice in some countries. Otherwise relevant international institutions recommend allowing an accompanying adult, present with the mother in the operating room during the entire process. What this study adds? Presence of partners during elective cesareans is a key factor for decreasing deliveries' anxiety, improving the overall experience, but it needs a mentality change in the obstetric and surgical team. These results could change the services organization in a more humane delivery, with overall positive impact in the patients' care.

Animal studies have shown there are enduring psychological processes in C-section born mice. However, the long-term impact of microbiota-gut-brain axis disruptions due to birth by C-section on psychological processes in humans is unknown. Forty age matched healthy young male university students born vaginally and 36 C-section delivered male students were recruited. Participants underwent an acute stressor, the Trier social stress test (TSST), during a term-time study visit. A subset of participants also completed a study visit during the university exam period, representing a naturalistic stressor. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests and self-report measures assessing mood, anxiety, and perceived stress. Saliva, blood, and stool samples were collected for analysis of cortisol, peripheral immune profile, and the gut microbiota. Young adults born by C-section exhibit increased psychological vulnerability to acute stress and a prolonged period of exam-related stress. They did not exhibit an altered salivary cortisol awakening response to the TSST, but their measures of positive affect were significantly lower than controls throughout the procedure. Both C-section and vaginally-delivered participants performed equally well on cognitive assessments. Most of the initial effects of delivery mode on the gut microbiome did not persist into adulthood as the gut microbiota profile showed modest changes in composition in adult vaginally-delivered and C-sectioned delivered subjects. From an immune perspective, concentrations of IL-1b and 1L-10 were higher in C-section participants. These data confirm that there is a potential enduring effect of delivery mode on the psychological responses to acute stress during early adulthood. The mental health implications of these observations require further study regarding policies on C-section use.

Studying these experiences is important for understanding the psychological mechanisms behind different childbirth experiences and their impact on maternal mental well-being.MethodsThis was a longitudinal mixed methods study. Descriptions of the birth experiences of 113 Finnish participants were gathered in a survey at 4-8 weeks postpartum and analysed with content analysis. Fear of childbirth was determined antenatally with the Wijma Delivery Expectations scale (W-DEQ A).The number of success and failure expressions were compared between people with FOC and others and between primiparous and multiparous people.ResultsThe contents of the childbirth-related experiences of success and failure were categorised into 12 subcategories, organised under three higher-order categories that were named personal factors, course of childbirth, and support. The most typical expressions of success were in the categories of mode of birth, staff, and mental factors, and the most typical expressions of failure in the categories of staff and mental factors. Experiences of failure were more often expressed by primiparous than multiparous people, but there were no statistically significant differences by FOC. Expressions of success were equally common regardless of parity or FOC.ConclusionPostpartum people categorise aspects of their birth experiences in terms of success and failure. Primiparous people are more susceptible to experiencing failure at childbirth, but possible differences between people with FOC and other people warrant further investigation.

The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate pregnancy and fetal/neonatal outcomes among women with a TBI diagnosis recorded during their delivery hospitalization compared with women without TBI. Setting: In this cross-sectional study, we identified women with delivery hospitalizations using 2004-2014 data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Health Care and Cost Utilization Project. Participants: We identified deliveries to women with a TBI diagnosis on hospital discharge records, which included all diagnoses recorded during the delivery, and compared them with deliveries of women without a TBI diagnosis. Main Measures: Pregnancy outcomes included gestational diabetes; preeclampsia/eclampsia; placental abruption; cesarean delivery; and others. Fetal/neonatal outcomes included preterm birth; stillbirth; and small or large gestational age. Design: We modeled risk for each outcome among deliveries to women with TBI compared with women without TBI, using multivariate Poisson regression. Models included sociodemographic and hospital characteristics; secondary models added clinical characteristics (eg, psychiatric disorders) that may be influenced by TBI. Results: We identified 3 597 deliveries to women with a TBI diagnosis and 9 106 312 deliveries to women without TBI. Women with TBI were at an increased risk for placental abruption (relative risk [RR] = 2.73; 95% CI, 2.26-3.30) and associated sequelae (ie, antepartum hemorrhage, cesarean delivery). Women with TBI were at an increased risk for stillbirth (RR = 2.55; 95% CI, 1.97-3.29) and having a baby large for gestational age (RR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09-1.56). Findings persisted after controlling for clinical characteristics. Conclusions: Risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including placental abruption and stillbirth, were increased among women with TBI. Future research is needed to examine the association between TBI and pregnancy outcomes using longitudinal and prospective data and to investigate potential mechanisms that may heighten risk for adverse outcomes.

Study design: This was a retrospective and observational study. Methods: Data were analysed from the Wuhan Maternal and Child Health Management Information System, which included all pregnant women who were at 24-42 weeks' gestation, with singleton pregnancies and who lived in Wuhan between 2010 and 2017. Joinpoint regression was used to analyse the trends in mean maternal age and the proportion of women with advanced maternal age. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) disorder, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), caesarean delivery, postpartum haemorrhage, preterm birth, small for gestational age, large for gestational age (LGA) and 5-min Apgar score <7 among women aged <20, 20-24, 30-35 and >=40 years were compared with women aged 25-29 years using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis and stratified analysis. Results: Among the 583,571 women included in this study, 1.2% were aged <20 years, 20.8% were aged 20-24 years, 47.9% were aged 25-29 years, 22.0% were aged 30-34 years, 6.9% were aged 35-39 years and 1.2% were aged >=40 years. Between 2010 and 2017, the mean maternal age increased from 27.1 years to 29.7 years, and the proportion of women aged >=35 years increased from 4.3% to 13.9%. Relative to women aged 25-29 years, women aged >=30 years carried higher risks of PIH, GDM, caesarean delivery, preterm birth, LGA and 5-min Apgar score <7. Relative to older multiparous women, older nulliparous women were more likely to experience caesarean delivery, preterm birth and 5-min Apgar score <7. Conclusions: The average maternal age and the proportion of advanced maternal age showed increasing trends between 2010 and 2017, which may be related to the relaxation of the one-child policy in China. Older maternal age (>=30 years) is independently associated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes may occur earlier than the commonly used definition of advanced maternal age (>=35 years) and may also differ by parity. Ensuring age- and parity-specific clinical counselling, antenatal surveillance and health interventions may significantly improve pregnancy outcomes in older mothers.

This is a single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial, in which we applied the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. The study was conducted in a city in Turkey's Central Anatolia region, and the data collection process was made between April and September 2019. One hundred and twenty primiparous pregnant women were assigned to either the antenatal education group (n = 60) or the control group (n = 60) via randomized block assignment. A total of 112 women were evaluated at the end of the study. Pregnant women in the antenatal education group were given two 2-hr sessions (240 min) twice a week for 4 weeks. It was found that those in the antenatal education group had less birth fear, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and increased childbirth self-efficacy compared to controls (p < 0.05). Those in the antenatal education group had significantly lower postnatal birth fear, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms compared to controls (p < 0.001). More vaginal births occurred in the antenatal education group compared to controls (p = 0.043). According to the outcome of this evidence-based study: antenatal education has important clinical benefits for women both during pregnancy and in the postpartum period and all pregnant women should receive this education.

Although biopsychosocial factors are known to modulate many types of chronic pain, their contribution to late pregnancy pain has not been comprehensively studied. We aimed to identify biopsychosocial factors associated with greater pain severity and interference during the last week of pregnancy. Methods: In this prospective, observational study, 662 pregnant women scheduled for cesarean delivery provided demographic and clinical information and completed validated psychological and pain assessments. Multivariable hierarchical linear regressions assessed independent associations of demographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics with pain severity and pain interference during the last week of pregnancy. Results: Women in the study had a mean age of 34 years, and 73% identified as White, 11% as African American, 10% as Hispanic/Latina, and 6% as Asian. Most women (66%) were scheduled for repeat cesarean delivery. Significant independent predictors of worse pain outcomes included identifying as African American or Hispanic/Latina and having greater depression, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing. Exploratory analyses showed that women scheduled for primary (versus repeat) cesarean delivery reported higher levels of anxiety and pain catastrophizing. Conclusions: Independent of demographic or clinical factors, psychological factors, including depression, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing, conferred a greater risk of late pregnancy pain. These findings suggest that women at higher risk of pain during late pregnancy could benefit from earlier nonpharmacological interventions that concurrently focus on psychological and pain symptoms.

As a result, SMM is currently used as a measure of maternity care level. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of SMM surrounding childbirth.MethodsA nested case-control study was performed between the years 2013-2018. SMM was defined as peripartum hospitalization involving intensive care unit (ICU). A comparison was conducted between parturient with SMM to those without, randomly matched for delivery mode and date of birth in a 1:1 ratio. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the independent association between SMM and different maternal and pregnancy characteristics.ResultsDuring the study period, 96,017 live births took place, of which 144 (1.5 per 1,000 live births-0.15%) involved SMM with ICU admissions. Parturient with SMM were more likely to have a history of 2 or more pregnancy losses (18.2% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.004), deliver preterm (48.9% vs. 8.8%, p < 0.001), and suffer from placenta previa (11.9% vs. 1.5%, p < 0.001), and/or placenta accreta (9.7% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.003). Several significant and independent risk factors for SMM were noted in the multivariable regression models: preterm delivery, history of >= 2 pregnancy losses, grand-multiparity, Jewish ethnicity, and abnormal placentation (previa or accreta).Conclusions for PracticeSMM rates in our cohort were lower than reported in developed countries. An independent association exists between peripartum maternal ICU admissions and several demographic and clinical risk factors, including preterm birth and abnormal placentation.

Therefore, every family member should acknowledge these processes, especially in an extended family set-up like in Indonesia. The general study objective was to predict several socio-demographic factors associated with mother-infant bonding in Indonesian samples. Method: This is a cross-sectional study. The participants included 168 mothers who had infants aged 0 to 36 months and willingly joined the study by signing the informed consent form. The Indonesian version of mother-infant bonding scale and a socio-demographic questionnaire were administered to all mothers. Logistic regression was applied to identify the socio-demographic factors that had any association with the mother-infant bonding scale. The data were analyzed using the SPSS program version 21 for Mac. Results: The study showed that 13.1% of the participants were categorized as having a moderate-to-high level of impaired mother-infant bonding. Logistic regression analysis showed that vaginal or normal delivery mode was 4.07 (95% CI [1.27, 13.09]) times more likely to exhibit low levels of impaired mother-infant bonding compared to a cesarean section. The model explained 18.6% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in impaired mother-infant bonding and accurately classified 86.9% of cases. Conclusion: The findings support prior studies that have been conducted in several countries. Psychoeducation on supporting mother-infant bonding may consist of several topics, such as the advantages of vaginal delivery mode and the importance of family support. It may be delivered in the early adulthood period and, hopefully, basic knowledge during those periods may help strengthen the understanding of mother-infant dyad issues among all family members.

This study sought to estimate the incidence of perinatal mental health disorders and the associated increased risk of leading pregnancy and infant complications. Methods: A population-based retrospective birth cohort of childbirth hospitalizations and readmissions was constructed for women in South Carolina, 1999 to 2017. Prevalence rates were calculated for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), severe mental illness, and mental disorders of pregnancy (MDP). Poisson regression models using generalized estimating equations were used to estimate adjusted relative risks for the association between mental health conditions and severe maternal morbidity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, cesarean section, preterm birth, and low birthweight. Results: The most prevalent maternal mental condition was MDP (3.9%), followed by PMAD (2.7%) and severe mental illness (0.13%). PMAD was associated with a higher risk of severe maternal morbidity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and cesarean section, as well as a higher risk of preterm birth and low birthweight infants. Severe mental illness was associated with low birthweight, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and cesarean section. Pregnant populations with MDP were more at risk for severe maternal morbidity, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, low birthweight, and cesarean section. Each maternal mental health outcome was associated with an increased risk for hospital readmissions up to 45 days after childbirth. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the escalating burden of PMAD and MDP for pregnant populations over time, with important consequences related to maternal and infant morbidity.

Data on mode of delivery were collected when children were 9 months and categorised as spontaneous vaginal delivery, assisted vaginal delivery, induced vaginal delivery, emergency caesarean section, planned caesarean section and caesarean section after induction of labor. Data on behavioural outcomes were collected at ages 3, 5, 7, 11, 14 and 17 years using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Crude and adjusted logistic regression examined mode of delivery-behavioural difficulties relationship, using validated SDQ cut-off points (total SDQ >= 17, emotional >= 5, conduct >= 4, hyperactivity >= 7, peer problems >= 4 and prosocial behaviour <= 4). Multilevel models with linear splines examined the association between mode of delivery and repeated measures of SDQ.ResultsThere were 18,213 singleton mother-child pairs included at baseline, 13,600 at age 3; 13,831 at age 5; 12,687 at age 7; 11,055 at age 11; 10,745 at age 14 and 8839 at age 17. Adjusted logistic regression suggested few associations between mode of delivery and behavioural outcomes at ages 3, 5, 11, 14 and 17 years using validated SDQ cut-off points. After correction for multiple testing, only the protective association between planned caesarean section-Conduct difficulties at age 5 years (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46, 0.85) and positive association between caesarean section after induction-Emotional difficulties at age 11 years (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19, 2.07) remained statistically significant.

Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the developmental trajectories of toddlers' emotional and behavioral problems and the predictive role of psycho-social, childbirth, and maternal characteristics. Method: Participants were 258 mothers and their children who took part in a longitudinal study from birth till the age of 30 months. Self-report instruments were used for the assessment of mothers' infant rearing attitudes, the quality of relationship with the partner, maternal emotional distress, and maternal self-efficacy. The Child Behavior Checklist (1 1/2-5) was used for the assessment of children's behavioral and emotional problems. Results: Latent class analysis for emotional and behavioral problems ended in 3-class solutions. In regard to emotional problems, 83% of children were classified as having a stable low, 11% an increasing, and 6% a decreasing level of emotional problems. In regard to behavioral problems, 86% of children showed a stable low, 5% an increasing, and 9% a stable high level of behavioral problems. Children's gender in combination with maternal education and maternal infant rearing attitudes predict children's membership in the increasing and decreasing emotional problem classes. Children's gender and maternal age in combination with emergency caesarean section, the quality of the relationship with the partner, and maternal self-efficacy explain children's membership in the classes of high and increasing behavioral problems. Conclusions: A combination of such factors as emergency caesarean section, child's gender, maternal age and level of education, maternal infant rearing attitudes, maternal self-efficacy, and inter-parental relationships predict developmental trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in toddlers.

Mean (SD) was computed for quantitative variables, while relative and absolute frequencies were determined for categorical variables. Additionally, confidence intervals were estimated.ResultsAmong pregnant women 18.3% were adolescents (<= 19 years) and 14.5% had advanced maternal age (>= 35 years). Illiteracy was reported by 8.2%. One in three (33.6%) had a short stature (< 1.55 m). Malaria was the most frequent infection during pregnancy (16.3%).

Methods: Data on a cohort of 1195 pregnant WWE from an epilepsy center in Poland from 2000 to 2019 were prospectively collected. Mann-Whitney U and ch2 tests -based comparisons between lactating and non-lactating WWE according to age, week of delivery, Apgar score, birth weight, type of epilepsy, seizure control, major congenital malformation (MCM), mode of delivery, type and dose of antiseizure medication (ASM) were performed. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify predictors of breastfeeding initiation. Results: Among 921 WWE, who gave birth to a living child, 709 (77%) initiated breastfeeding. The annual rate did not significantly change over the study period. Higher breastfeeding initiation rates were associated with vaginal birth (OR = 0.66) and lack of MCM (OR = 0.23). Breastfeeding initiation was less frequent with old-generation ASM monotherapy (OR = 0.36) or polytherapy (OR = 0.33) compared to no ASM treatment. The rate of breastfeeding initiation was positively associated with gestational week and the newborn's condition. At 6 months, about 1/3 of WWE maintained lactation. Conclusion: Approximately  3/4 of the WWE cohort initiated breastfeeding. Breastfeeding initiation was associated with delivery mode, treatment type, and the newborn's condition but was not associated with seizures during pregnancy or the individual ASM dose. Further studies are needed to identify additional factors that may negatively affect breastfeeding.

The present study examines the association between different maternal obstetric factors and PTB. In addition, this study estimates the risk of neonatal mortality among children born preterm. Study design: Retrospective two-stage stratified sample design. Methods: The weighted prevalence of PTB was estimated using data on 148,746 most recent institutional births from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4, 2015-16. The Poisson regression model was used to investigate the association between maternal obstetric factors and PTB. Using Cox's proportional hazard model, the risk of neonatal mortality among PTBs was estimated. Results: Maternal obstetric factors, such as minimal antenatal care, delivery complications, history of previous caesarean delivery and delivery at private health facilities, were significantly associated with an increased risk of PTB. The survival probability of preterm babies sharply declined in the first week of life and thereafter was found to stabilise. The risk of mortality in the first 28 days of life increased 2.5-fold if the baby was born preterm. Optimising antenatal care was found to lower the likelihood of PTB and improve their chances of survival. Conclusion: Antenatal care services and delivery care practices in private facilities were strongly associated with the incidence and survival of PTB. Evaluating associations of history of caesarean births on future pregnancies can help understand their deleterious effects on PTB. Affordable, accessible and available antenatal care services, in both public and private facilities, can increase the survival rates of PTBs.

However, little is known about how postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) influences postpartum depressive symptoms. This study explored the relationship between PPH and postpartum depressive symptoms in the Chinese population. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Baoan Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 2016 to June 2020. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess postpartum depressive symptoms. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) between PPH and risk of postpartum depressive symptoms. Results: Of the 7734 respondents, 293 (3.8%) and 7441 were in the PPH and control groups, respectively. Puerperal women with PPH were more likely to screen positive for postpartum depressive symptoms than those without PPH (16.4% vs. 11.7%, p = .016). Adjusting for other covariates, women with PPH still had higher risk of postpartum depressive symptoms (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.16-2.42). Stratification analyses revealed no interaction between PPH and maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index, mode of delivery, and fetal sex in developing depressive symptoms (p for interaction > .05). Conclusions: PPH may increase the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms. Therefore, women with PPH should be actively screened for depressive symptoms in the immediate postpartum period.

However, it is not clear the prevalence and risk factors of FOC among pregnant women in a region with a moderate level of economic development in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of FOC among pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy in Lianyungang city, Eastern China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2022 to February 2023 among pregnant women in the third trimester who met the inclusion criteria and visited Lianyungang Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Jiangsu Province, Eastern China. A structured questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, FOC, family function, doctor-patient communication, social support, general self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, insomnia symptoms, and quality of life was used to collect data. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify predictors of FOC. Results: This study included 535 pregnant women in the third trimester. The mean score of FOC was 30.67 +- 10.18, and the median score was 29.00. The prevalence of FOC was 56.64%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that pregnant women with electronic screen exposure time more than 5 h per day (b = 2.02, 95%CI: 0.50-3.53, P < 0.05), no history of cesarean section (b = 2.66, 95%CI: 0.61-4.71, P < 0.05), likes sour food or hates greasy food (b = 1.75, 95%CI: 0.00-3.50, P < 0.05), anxiety (b = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.21-0.80, P < 0.05) and depression (b = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.04-0.57, P < 0.05) were more likely to have a greater level of FOC than their counterparts. However, a significantly lower level of FOC was observed in pregnant women who were multipara (b=-1.64, 95%CI: -3.27-0.01, P < 0.05), not worrying about delivery without family members (b=-3.75, 95%CI: -5.26-2.25, P < 0.001), had good family function (b=-0.32, 95%CI: -0.64-0.00, P < 0.05) and doctor-patient communication (b=-0.33, 95%CI: -0.64-0.02, P < 0.05). Conclusions: The prevalence of FOC was high in Lianyungang city, Eastern China. FOC is influenced by multiple factors. There is an urgent need to develop interventions to reduce the prevalence of FOC in the third trimester of pregnancy, and to pay attention to pregnant women with risk factors for FOC.

Many studies have examined from a medical and physiological point of view, but research from a women's standpoint is lacking. Our aim was to develop a model of the emerging expectations of giving birth and the subsequent experiences of healthy primigravid women, across four cantons in Switzerland. This longitudinal study included 30 primigravidae from the German speaking, 14 from the French speaking and 14 from the Italian speaking cantons who were purposively selected. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews taking place around 22 and 36 weeks of pregnancy and six weeks and six months postnatally. Following Gadamer's hermeneutic, which in this study comprised 5 stages, a model was developed. Four major themes emerged: Decisions, Care, Influences and Emotions. Their meandering paths and evolution demonstrate the complexity of the expectations and experiences of women becoming mothers. In this study, women's narrated mode of birth expectations did not foretell how they gave birth and their lived experiences. A hermeneutic discontinuity arises at the 6 week postnatal interview mark. This temporary gap illustrates the bridge between women's expectations of birth and their actual lived experiences, highlighting the importance of informed consent, parent education and ensuring women have a positive birth and immediate postnatal experiences. Other factors than women's preferences should be considered to explain the increasing caesarean section rates.

Methods: A cross-sectional study is survey based using an online survey platform. Three hundred pregnant women were included between 16 May and 12 June 2020 in Turkey. Sociodemographic features, obstetric features, concerns about COVID-19, delivery method preferences, and Brief Measure of Worry Severity were evaluated. Results: It was determined that the concerns of pregnant women about the pandemic were moderate (12.73 +- 6.838) and did not alter their delivery method preferences. However, the concerns of the pregnant women who planned to perform their delivery by caesarean section before COVID-19 and whose delivery method preferences changed during the pandemic process were higher (p < 0.05). Additionally, during the COVID-19 period, pregnant women often harbour concerns such as 'not knowing how it would affect my baby if I have to take medications for COVID-19 (90.3%)' 'getting infected by COVID-19 during my pregnancy (89.7%)' 'not having a healthy pregnancy until birth (89%)'. Conclusions: Delivery method preferences of pregnant women did not change in the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, COVID- 19 pandemic is impacting on the pregnant women experiencing moderate concerns about their pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period, and their baby.

This study explored the potential dependence of these two bariatric surgery-related risks. Subjects/Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study with adult women (18-45) who underwent bariatric surgery between 1996 and 2016 and who gave birth after surgery between 1996 and 2018. The study population consisted of 1849 post-bariatric surgery women with 3010 reported post-surgical births. Subjects with post-surgical, prenatal SUD were identified based on diagnosis codes extracted within the 10 months prior to delivery. Using random-effects logistic regression with retrospective cohort data, preterm birth, low birth weight, macrosomia, Caesarian delivery, congenital anomalies, and neonatal intensive care unit admission were considered as outcomes. Results: About 10% (n = 289) of women had an SUD diagnosis within 10 months prior to child delivery. Women with SUD during pregnancy had significantly more pregnancy and birth complications compared to women without SUD: preterm birth (OR = 2.08, p = 0.03, 95% CI: 1.07-4.03), low birth weight (OR = 3.41, p < 0.01, 95% CI: 1.99-5.84), Caesarian delivery (OR = 9.71, p < 0.01, 95% CI: 2.69-35.05), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (OR = 3.87, p < 0.01, 95% CI: 2.04-7.34). Women with SUD had lower risk for macrosomia than women without SUD (OR = 0.07, p = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01-0.70). Conclusion: Results from this study demonstrated that post-bariatric surgery women who had SUD during pregnancy had significantly more pregnancy- and birth-related complications than post-surgery pregnant women without SUD, despite the reduction in macrosomia. Where possible, greater prenatal surveillance of post-surgery women with SUD should be considered.

Lower autonomy of women affects the socio-economic, emotional, fertility decision, contraceptive use, and sexual life of the women. Thus, this study aimed to assess maternal autonomy and associated factors in making a decision to utilize health services for themselves and neonates in south Ethiopia. Methods: Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from January 1 to March 2, 2021, in Shashamane town. Four hundred ten postpartum mothers were selected using a stratified random sampling technique and interviewed for the survey using questions composed of decision-making autonomy components (decision-making power, control over finances, and freedom of movement). The data were checked for consistency, coded, and entered using EpiData Manager (version 4.6.0.4) and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 26. Descriptive statistics, composite score analysis, and binary and multivariate logistic regression were done to capture the objectives. Result: 410 postpartum mothers were interviewed while the mean and standard deviation of the participants' age was 26.96 +- 5.38. About 48.5% of mothers had high decision-making autonomy for their own and their neonates' health service utilization. Being in monogamous marriage (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.74), and mode of delivery (Cesarean section) (AOR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.18, 3.07) were significantly associated with having high maternal decision-making autonomy. Conclusions: More than half of the study participants had low maternal decision-making autonomy for their own and their neonates' health service utilization. Being in monogamous marriage, and mode of delivery (Cesarean section) were factors significantly associated with high maternal decision-making autonomy. Encouraging mothers to use facility delivery was recommended.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed claims data from a single-payer Preferred Provider Organization from June 2014 to May 2019 in 84 hospitals in a statewide quality collaborative. All patients aged 12-55 years, undergoing childbirth, with continuous enrollment in pregnancy were included. The primary outcome was the predicted rate of postpartum opioid fills from 7 days before birth to 3 days after discharge. Secondary outcomes included postpartum opioid prescription size in oral morphine equivalents, a standardized measure that includes the number of pills prescribed times the strength of the medication. Multilevel regression models accounted for clustering. We calculated attributable variation in opioid fills using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Of 41,427 births, 15,459 patients (37.2%) filled a postpartum opioid prescription (vaginal, 4,624/27,536 [16.8%]; cesarean, 10,835/13,891 [78.0%]). The median postpartum prescription size was 150 oral morphine equivalents (interquartile range [IQR], 30) (vaginal, 135; [IQR, 45]; cesarean, 150 [IQR, 75]). In adjusted models, the rates of opioid prescribing after vaginal birth differed from cesarean birth (vaginal median, 12.1% [range, 1.1%-60.0%]; cesarean median, 80.4% [range, 43.6%-90.2%]). More variation in postpartum opioid fills was attributable to providers and hospitals for vaginal (provider, 29%; hospital, 24%) than cesarean birth (provider, 8%; hospital, 6%). Variation in prescription size was driven by providers for vaginal birth (provider, 27%; hospital, 6%) and providers and hospitals for cesarean birth (provider, 29%; hospital, 21%). Conclusions: Across a statewide quality collaborative, variation in postpartum opioid prescribing is attributable to providers and hospitals. Future efforts at the provider and hospital levels are needed to implement best practices for postpartum opioid prescribing.

It occurs when blood loss exceeds 1000mL regardless of the delivery route. Careful assessment of various causes and risk factors of PPH is essential to reduce and prevent further complications, avoid maternal morbidity and mortality, and better manage PPH. This study aimed to examine the associations of hospital characteristics and regions of hospital locations across the United States with PPH risk, as the outcomes of such an assessment may contribute to practice-relevant scientific evidence to improve policies and protocols regarding effective PPH management. Methods: This retrospective study used the 2018 National Inpatient Sample database from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) to examine the associations of PPH risk with characteristics and regions of hospital lections. Results: After controlling for clinical risk factors, the results showed that hospitals owned by private investors had significant associations with decreased risk of PPH. Conversely, large bed size, urban teaching status, and West and Midwest location were associated with an increased risk of PPH. Conclusion: Additional research is needed to determine whether these variations across regions and hospital characteristics are due to differences in obstetric practice and management.

Methods: This is an ongoing cohort designed study to measure the effect of environmental factors on children's health with the use of data from the Japan Environment and Children's Study. We investigated mother-infant bonding at 1 year old according to parity and mode of delivery. Results: A total of 82,540 participants, including 36,662 primipara mothers and 45,878 multipara mothers, were analyzed in the present study. Exclusive breastfeeding, marriage, and non-working factors were higher in multipara mothers than in primipara mothers. The total Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale Japanese version (MIBS-J) score was higher (worse) in primipara than multipara (mean total: 1.129 vs. 0.897, p < 0.001). Primipara mothers also had higher anger and rejection scores than multipara mothers. When we analyzed only multipara mothers without any history of previous Cesarean section (CS), MIBS-J scores were higher in Cesarean delivery mothers than vaginal delivery mothers (p = 0.038). Limitations: We used a self-reported bonding measure. Although a self-report measure is convenient and important, an observer rating may be less susceptible to bias in perception. We did not distinguish elective CS from emergency CS, which may have different influences on mother-infant bonding. Conclusions: Primipara mothers showed worse mother-infant bonding than multipara mothers, regardless of mode of delivery. Caesarian delivery itself appears to have little effect on mother-infant bonding.

However, no research has assessed how length of stay may differ for women with different types of disability while also considering mode of delivery. Objective: To examine the association of disability status and disability type with length of stay, taking into account disability-related differences in mode of delivery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked maternal and infant hospital discharge and vital records data for all births in California between 2000 and 2012 (n = 6,745,201). We used multivariable regression analyses to assess association of disability status and type with prolonged length of stay (> 2 days for vaginal delivery or > 4 days for cesarean) while controlling for covariates. Results: Women with disabilities had significantly elevated adjusted odds of prolonged length of stay compared to women without disabilities (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.32-1.49). Adjusted odds were highest for women with vision disabilities (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.46-1.90), followed by women with IDD (aOR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.30-1.80), and women with physical disabilities (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.32-1.50). Women with hearing disability had the lowest adjusted odds of prolonged length of stay (aOR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.03-1.33). Conclusions: Prolonged length of stay did not appear to be due solely to the higher proportion of cesarean deliveries in this population.

The establishment of an effective PPD prediction model helps to distinguish high-risk groups, and verifying whether such high-risk groups can benefit from drug intervention is very important for clinical guidance. Methods: We collected data of parturients that underwent a cesarean delivery. The Control group was divided into a training cohort and a testing cohort. Six different ML models were constructed and we compared their prediction performance in the testing cohort. For model interpretation, we introduced SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Then, training cohort, ketamine group and dexmedetomidine (DEX) group were classified as high or low risk for PPD by the model. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare the incidence of PPD between two groups in different risk cohorts. Results: Extreme gradient enhancement (XGB) had the best recognition effect, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.789 (95 % CI 0.742-0.836) in the training cohort and 0.744 (95 % CI 0.655-0.823) in the testing cohort, respectively. A threshold of 21.5 % PPD risk probability was determined. After PSM, the results showed that the incidence of PPD in the two intervention groups was significantly different from the control group in the high-risk cohort (P < 0.001) but not in the low-risk cohort (P > 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the XGB algorithm provided a more accurate in prediction of PPD risk, and it was beneficial to receive early intervention for the high-risk groups distinguished by the model.

Although pregnancy-related changes in anatomy and metabolism return to their prepregnancy state, female sexual function may not be at the level it was before birth because of physical and psychological changes. Aim: The goal of our study was to explore the influence of the mode of delivery, perineal injury, and peripartum expectations on postpartum sexual function. Methods: Between 2013 and 2018, 522 women were enrolled in this prospective investigation. At time of recruitment during the peripartum hospitalization, patients completed a standardized questionnaire addressing expectations concerning postpartum sexuality with focus on expected influence of the mode of delivery. Sexual function was evaluated using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ) at time of recruitment to evaluate baseline sexual function (4 weeks before pregnancy). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Outcomes: Peripartum expectations, influence of the mode of delivery, and perineal injury were analyzed for their impact on women's sexual function within 12 months postpartum by repetitive FSFI and SAQ assessments. Results: A total of 522 women with 263 spontaneous vaginal deliveries, 41 operative vaginal deliveries, and 218 cesarean sections were analyzed. Although the data demonstrate a significant postpartum decline in sexual function at 3 and 6 months postpartum, sexual functioning converges to baseline prepregnancy values 12 months postpartum. This observation was independent of the mode of delivery and perineal injuries with no significant between-group differences at any of the analyzed time points. Apart from breastfeeding, for which negative anticipations resulted in impaired sexuality, women's expectations (pertaining to quantity and quality of female orgasm, partner's sexuality, fear of altered sexuality, frequency of intercourse, the mode of delivery) do not influence female sexual function at 12 months postpartum. Clinical Implications: Deciphering the potential influence of patient expectations as well as pregnancy- and childbirth-related aspects on female postpartum sexuality will help in the effort to improve women's postpartum sexual health. Strengths & Limitations: As a strength of this study, postpartum sexuality was independently assessed with 2 different scoring systems (FSFI and SAQ). Limitations include that our follow-up is incomplete and amounts to about 2-thirds of patients who were initially recruited. Conclusion: The mode of delivery and perineal trauma do not influence women's postpartum sexual function. With the exception of breastfeeding, peripartum expectations do not result in altered sexual functioning at 12 months postpartum.

Design: Repeated cross-sectional design. Setting: Online surveys. Participants: Clinicians (883 nurses and 201 physicians in the before-ARRIVE group and 1,741 nurses and 574 physicians in the after-ARRIVE group) who provided intrapartum care at 35 hospitals in California in 2017 and 57 hospitals in Michigan in 2020 and participated in statewide quality improvement efforts to reduce use of cesarean. Methods: We used annual nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex cesarean rates to stratify hospitals into performance quartiles. We used cumulative proportional odds logistic regression to examine induction attitudes before and after ARRIVE by role and hospital performance quartile as well as induction attitudes and patient safety culture among clinicians. We used content analysis to examine qualitative data. Results: After ARRIVE, physicians' attitudes shifted in favor of induction at hospitals within the top three performance categories (top quartile: M = 3.48 vs. 2.81, p < .0001), whereas nurses' attitudes did not change (p = .388). After ARRIVE, attitudes among clinicians were more aligned at hospitals with stronger patient safety cultures. Qualitative themes included The Timing of Induction is Important, Who Should Have Inductions, Need for Clear Protocols and More Staff, and Ideas to Improve the Induction of Labor Process. Conclusion: Physician attitudes about induction were significantly different before versus after ARRIVE, whereas nurse attitudes were not. Differences in attitudes may erode the quality of team-based care; intentional interdisciplinary engagement is essential when implementing ARRIVE findings.

This study explored the association of caesarean section vs. vaginal birth with childhood overweight in Vietnam. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study explored the association of delivery mode with overweight, obesity, and overweight/or obesity at 8 years of age in children (n = 1937) across 20 sites in Vietnam, using Young Lives longitudinal cohort study data. Categories were defined using BMI z-scores in relationship to the World Health Organization (WHO) reference median: overweight >1 and <2 standard deviations (SD) above WHO reference median, obese >2 SD, and overweight/or obese >1 SD. Individual questionnaire data collected sociodemographic information and pregnancy/birth information through face-to-face interviews with mothers/caregivers. Anthropometric measurements for mother and child were collected at baseline and at 8 years for children. Results: Adjusted multivariable logistic models revealed a twofold increase in odds at age 8 years of overweight [odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.03-3.2, p = 0.039], obese (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.0, p = 0.014), or overweight/or obese (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.3, p = 0.002) for children born through caesarean section compared with vaginal birth. Children born through planned caesarean section (adjusted OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, p < 0.001) and unplanned caesarean section (adjusted OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.5, p = 0.03) had similar increased odds of overweight/or obesity compared with children born through vaginal birth. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there may be an association between caesarean section and childhood overweight even after adjustment for confounders. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of this finding.

MethodsData from 1305 mother-child pairs from the MINA-Brazil population-based birth cohort study were used. GWG was classified according to two methods, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and INTERGROWTH-21st standards. Poisson and linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations with perinatal outcomes.ResultsFollowing IOM guidelines (n = 1305), the rates of insufficient and excessive GWG were found to be similar (32%). Excessive GWG was associated with higher new-born birthweight (BW) z-scores; increased risks of macrosomia, large for gestational age (LGA), and caesarean delivery; and lower risks of low birthweight (LBW) and being small for gestational age (SGA). Insufficient GWG was associated with lower new-born BW z-scores. Among women with normal pre-pregnancy body mass indices (BMIs, n = 658), inappropriate GWG was high following both methods (IOM: 41.2% insufficient, 24.8% excessive; INTERGROWTH-21st: 25.2% below - 1 z-score, 16.9% above 1 z-score). Both methods also indicated that new-borns of women with excessive GWG had higher BW z-scores and increased risk of macrosomia and LGA. Women with GWG below the INTERGROWTH-21st standards were more likely to deliver an infant SGA and with lower BW z-scores.ConclusionsInappropriate GWG remains a health concern irrespective of the method used to classify weight gain. GWG above the recommendations of both methods and below the INTERGROWTH-21st standard was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Therefore, INTERGROWTH-21st standards seem to be a better fit for healthy women in this population.

The side effects of these drugs, for example weight gain and increased blood sugar, are well described for the general population. In particular, olanzapine, quetiapine and clozapine are known to cause these effects. Studies on their effects on blood sugar control in pregnant women have however been conflicting. Pregnancy itself also imposes a risk for increased blood sugar levels and gestational diabetes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of gestational diabetes connected to the use of antipsychotics during pregnancy. The study was nationwide and register based including 1.3 million births in Sweden between July 2006 and December 2017. The rates of gestational diabetes and the infants being small for gestational age or large for gestational age amongst women treated with antipsychotics were compared to the rates in pregnant women who did not receive antipsychotics and to rates in a control group of women treated with antipsychotics before/after but not during pregnancy. Antipsychotics were divided into three groups: (i) first-generation antipsychotics, (ii) high-risk second-generation antipsychotics including olanzapine, quetiapine and clozapine, and (iii) other second-generation antipsychotics. Women treated with high-risk second-generation antipsychotics were found to have an increased risk of gestational diabetes and giving birth to an infant being large for gestational age, both when compared with untreated pregnant women and with the control group. Other antipsychotics were not connected to increased risks of these outcomes. Hence, pregnant women treated with olanzapine, quetiapine or clozapine should be monitored regarding blood sugar levels.

We sought to examine the association between pregnant women with OCD and obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in the USA. A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using data provided by pregnant women from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative database of hospitalizations in the USA, from 1999 to 2015. Using diagnostic and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), we identified births and classified women by OCD status. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared for women with and without OCD and multivariate logistic regressions were used to obtain odds ratios (OR) to compare obstetrical and neonatal outcomes between the two groups, adjusting for relevant demographic and clinical variables. Between 1999 and 2015, there were 3365 births to women with OCD, corresponding to an overall prevalence of 24.40 per 100,000 births. Women with OCD were more likely to be older than 25, Caucasian, of higher socioeconomic status, smokers or used drugs and alcohol, and have other comorbid psychiatric conditions. In adjusted models, OCD was associated with a higher risk of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, premature rupture of membranes, caesarean and instrumental deliveries, venous thromboembolisms and preterm birth. Pregnancies in women with OCD are at high risk of adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach should be used to identify high risk behaviours and ensure adequate prenatal follow-up and care be available for those with high risk pregnancies.

This study was designed to assess suboptimal breastfeeding practice and its associated factors among children age less than two years in South Wollo, northeast Ethiopia. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 636 women-child pairs. The study participants were selected by a multi sage random sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, then it was entered into Epi-Data version 3.1, and exported into SPSS version 24.0 for analysis. A Binary Logistic Regression Model with a backward elimination method was used to determine the association of factors and suboptimal breastfeeding practice of babies at a 95% confidence interval. Result Six hundred and thirty-six participants were included with a response rate of 99.7%. The study showed that 36.3% babies age less than 2 years were received suboptimal breastfeeding. Cesarean delivery [AOR: 8.81; 95% CI (4.92-15.77)], lack of breastfeeding counseling [AOR: 3.22; 95% CI (1.93-5.36)], maternal feeding less than 5 times/day during breastfeeding [AOR: 2.01; 95% CI (1.20-3.34)], child health problems [AOR: 3.57; 95%CI (2.17-5.85)], and babies age less than 6 months [AOR:1.92; 95%CI (1.24-2.97)] were positively associated with suboptimal breastfeeding practice. Conclusion Suboptimal breastfeeding practice is highly prevalent in Ethiopia. Health service-related and socio-cultural factors were associated with the high prevalence of suboptimal breastfeeding practice. Emphasis should be given to the breastfeeding practices of children age less than years in Ethiopia. Moreover, counseling regarding the importance of breastfeeding practices should be strengthened. Significance The finding of this study provides essential information to the zonal health office, regional health bureau, and other health care organizations which helped to design interventional measures for promoting breastfeeding practice in the study area. The study could also provide insight for healthcare professionals to work on improving breastfeeding status in children aged less than two years. Finally, the finding could support the improvement of child health by improving the breastfeeding status.

These relationships are considerably stronger between population-based caesarean section rates and socio-economic characteristics with poorest households experiencing significant unmet needs persistently. Objective: To explore the characteristics of women receiving emergency C-section using a new, validated definition in Ghana and the Dominican Republic. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Ghana and the Dominican Republic. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine women's characteristics associated with emergency C-section. Results: This analysis included 2166 women who had recently delivered via C-section comprising 653 and 1513 participants from Accra and Santo Domingo, DR, respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that women, both in Ghana and the DR, were more likely to have an emergency C-section if they did not have a previous C-Section (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 2.45, 95% CI [1.57-3.81]; and aOR: 15.5, 95% CI [10.5-22.90], respectively) and if they were having their first childbirth, compared to women with previous childbirth (aOR: 1.77, 95%CI [1.13-2.79]; and aOR: 1.46, 95%CI [1.04-2.04], respectively). Also, preterm birth was associated with significantly decreased likelihood of emergency C-section compared with childbirth occurring at term in both Ghana and the DR (aOR: 0.31, 95%CI [0.20-0.48]; and aOR: 0.43, 95%CI [0.32-0.58], respectively). Among the Ghanaian participants, having an emergency C-section was positively associated with being referred and negatively associated with being older than 35 years of age. Characteristics such as education, religion, marital status, and residence did not differ between women's emergency versus non-emergency C-section status. Conclusion: Emergency C-section was found to be significantly higher in women with no prior C-section or those having their first births but lower in those with preterm birth in both Ghana and the DR. Data from additional countries are needed to confirm the relationship between emergency C-section status and socio-economic and obstetric characteristics, given that the types of interventions required to assure equitable access to potentially life-saving C-section will be determined by how and when access to care is being denied or not available.

The aim was to investigate the prevalence of pre-established reasons in relation to fear, and to identify profiles of women based on their reported reasons behind fear of birth. Methods: A cross-sectional Swedish study of women with self-reported fear of birth who completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used in the analysis of pre-established reasons in relation to self-reported severe fear. A Kappa-means cluster analysis was performed in order to group reasons, that were further investigated in relation to women's background variables. Results: A total of 1419 women completed the survey. The strongest reason behind fear of birth was to be forced to give birth vaginally. Four clusters were identified and labeled: minor complexity (reference group), relative minor complexity, relative major complexity, and major complexity. Cesarean section preference, previous mental health problems, being younger, primiparity, and exposure to domestic violence were factors related to cluster grouping. Conclusions: Women with fear of birth have various reasons and diverse complexities behind their fear. Health care providers need to investigate these reasons and support pregnant women with childbirth fear, based on their needs.

The study was conducted between September 2019 and February 2020 in the obstetric clinic. Data were collected using a Data Collection Form, the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF), and the LATCH Breastfeeding Evaluation Tool. Throughout the study, we followed the STROBE Checklist. Mothers who gave birth via spontaneous vaginal delivery had a statistically higher mean Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy score (54.92 +- 7.72; p < .001) than those who gave birth under spinal anesthesia (43.21 +- 10.04; p < .001) and then those who gave birth via cesarean section under general anesthesia (37.39 +- 10.64; p < .001). The difference between the delivery modes in terms of breastfeeding self-efficacy and breastfeeding success scores was statistically significant (respectively, KW = 40.168, p < .001 and KW = 52.420, p < .001). In order to increase the breastfeeding success of mothers who give birth via cesarean section under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, lactation nurses need to strengthen the perception of breastfeeding self-efficacy and provide more breastfeeding support to them compared to mothers who give birth via SVD.

During a longitudinal evaluation for 2018-2022 of an interprofessional learning (IPL) curriculum, nearly 7000 students from health, social care, and teacher education programs completed indicator questions concerning learning about child-related topics and skills required for IPC during their first, second, and third curriculum years of study. The students worked in student-led IPL groups according to a case-based learning approach. Online IPL yielded lower mean scores than in-person IPL. The decreased learning outcomes from year 2 to year 3 for the IPL initiative are not due to the online delivery mode. The lack of reported progress in the IPL courses is more likely due to students not experiencing a gain in IPL learning outcomes. Significant differences were found between teacher education and child welfare students and health and social care students, reflecting IPC challenges in working life. We conclude that online IPL is forward-looking because candidates must be prepared for online IPC and for helping users, such as children, online. Although our data support that IPL is complex, the learning experience has tremendous transfer value to welfare services because we assume that the same issues will appear in IPC.

Outcomes Measurement: A validated questionnaire was applied, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Score, to evaluate effects of operative delivery on sexual health. Sexual dysfunction was defined by FSFI score <26.55. Results: 211 women answered at least one questionnaire. Overall rate of sexual dysfunction was 62%, 43% and 48% at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. At 3 months, total FSFI score was significantly lower in operative vaginal delivery group (mean+-SD, 21.3+-8.6 vs 24.9+-7.9, P = 0.015). Arousal (P = 0.028), orgasm (P = 0.029), satisfaction (P = 0.015) and pain (P = 0.007) FSFI domains were also significantly inferior. At this time, 44% women in spontaneous delivery group and 70% in operative delivery group had sexual dysfunction (P = 0.0002). At 6 months, there were no differences in FSFI scores according the type of delivery. At 12 months, total FSFI score was similar in both groups, but pain domain was significantly lower in operative delivery (P = 0.004). Considering type of instrument (Thierry's Spatulas or Kiwi Vacuum), no differences were found regarding episiotomy, perineal trauma, obstetric anal sphincter injury or postpartum complications. FSFI scores did not differ between the two instruments at any time point. A logistic regression showed that, when controlled for perineal trauma, mode of delivery was independently associated with sexual dysfunction at 3 months (P = 0.02). Clinical Implications: Clinicians should assess women's sexual health during pregnancy and postpartum period in order to enhance their wellbeing. Strengths/Limitations: Strengths include its prospective design, standardized questionnaire and the new perspectives about a different obstetrical instrument (Thierry's spatulas). Limitations include the absence of pre-pregnancy sexual function data and considerable drop-out rate. Conclusion: Sexual dysfunction affects a great proportion of newly mothers and in postpartum period mode of delivery and perineal trauma seem to play an important role. Although there was a progressive reduction over time, prevalence of sexual dysfunction at 6 months and 1 year postpartum was still considerable. The type of obstetrical instrument does not seem to influence short or long-term sexual function.

The antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of plasma oxytocin are well-documented, but it is still disputable whether synthetic oxytocin (synOT) may protect women against postpartum mood alterations. The current study examined the association between synOT intrapartum and maternal mood postpartum using a prospective design. Two hundred sixty women were screened for depressive symptoms in the last trimester of pregnancy and then again 6 weeks and 9 months postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. They also completed Maternity Blues Questionnaire in the first postpartum week. The data concerning the intrapartum interventions and health status of the newborn were extracted from the medical records. Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for a history of depression, mode of delivery, and childbirth experience showed that synOT predicted a significantly lower risk of PPD (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.95, p = 0.025). The risk factors for PPD included a history of depression (HR = 3.20, 95% CI 2.33-4.40, p < 0.001) and negative childbirth experience (HR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.01-1.90, p = 0.040). Logistic regression adjusted for the same covariates found no significant effect of synOT on maternity blues (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.31-1.32, p = 0.23). While synOT administered intrapartum does not affect maternal mood immediately, it may come to effect some weeks after childbirth to protect mothers from developing PPD symptoms.

Caesarean Section (C-Section) is an intervention to reduce complications associated with childbirth, but it also has risks, including maternal infections, anaesthetic and psychological complications. There are few studies that analyse the C-Section rates in women with BD compared to the general population. Methods: : A case-control study was conducted in a general university hospital. 100 pregnant women with BD matched with 100 controls without psychiatric illness who were attending the same hospital at delivery. We compared obstetrical outcomes during pregnancy, Pre/During Labour, onset of labour and mode of delivery specifying the type of C-Section. Results: : Rate of C-Section was significantly higher in BD group compared to the control group (OR=2, 95% CI 1,4-1,6). Case group had more somatic illness (SI) without treatment (P < , 001). BD (P = ,021), primiparity (P = , 003), obstetric complications during pregnancy (P < , 001), obstetric complications during labour (P < ,001), and SI with and without treatment (P < ,001 and P = ,007, respectively) were higher in women that required C- section. Conclusion: : Women with Bipolar Disorder have near two-fold increased risk of C-section than women without Bipolar Disorder of similar age, gestational age and parity. Somatic illness was more prevalent in BD group that required C-section and this relation probably is related to high probability of having somatic comorbidities in patients with BD.

There is little information available about its incidence, risk factors and physician perception. Methods: Parturients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean delivery were enrolled. Before surgery, parturients were asked about preoperative anxiety on a verbal numerical scale (VNS), anticipated analgesic requirement, postoperative pain levels, Spielberger STATE-TRAIT inventory index, Pain Catastrophizing Scale. After surgery, parturients were asked to answer questions (intraoperative VNS pain). The anaesthesiologist and obstetrician were asked to fill out a questionnaire asking about perceived intraoperative pain. Influence of preoperative anxiety on intraoperative pain (yes/no) was assessed using logistic regression. Mc Fadden's R2 was calculated. The agreement in physician perception of intraoperative pain with reported pain by the parturient was examined by calculating Cohen's kappa and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Results: We included 193 parturients in our analysis. Incidence of intraoperative pain was 11.9%. Median intraoperative VNS pain of parturients with pain was 4.0 (1st quartile 4.0; 3rd quartile 9.0). Preoperative anxiety was not a good predictor of intraoperative pain (p-value of b-coefficient = 0.43, Mc Fadden's R2 = 0.01). Including further preoperative variables did not result in a good prediction model. Cohen's kappa between reported pain by parturient and by the obstetrician was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.41) and by the anaesthesiologist was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.48). Conclusions: We found a substantial incidence (11.9%) of intraoperative pain during caesarean delivery. Preoperative anxiety did not predict intraoperative pain. Physicians did not accurately identify parturients' intraoperative pain. Significance: Intraoperative pain occurred in 11.9% and severe intraoperative pain occurred in 1.11% of parturients undergoing elective caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia. We did not find any preoperative variables that could reliably predict intraoperative pain. Obstetricians and anaesthesiologists underestimated the incidence of intraoperative pain in our cohort and thus, more attention must be put to parturients' pain.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. KAP towards COVID-19 was assessed using 21-item questionnaires. A score for each category was calculated and points were summed. The outcome variables of KAP were compared with demographic characteristics. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 19. Results: A total of 377 patients participated in the study. The majority of the patients were multiparous (36.8%) in the age group of 30-40years (42.4%). More than 90% of patients were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and mode of transmission. They were aware of no cure for disease and optimum social distance. Although < 50% of patients truly answered the questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the risk of congenital malformation, vertical transmission, and the effect of infection on the mode of delivery. Regarding attitude and practices,> 90% of patients were anxious about fetal and personal safety, they are using a facemask, sanitizing their hands regularly, and avoiding social gatherings. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis showed statistically significant results among demographic variables (age, parity, family members, occupational status, and source of information). Conclusion: Pregnant patients demonstrated inadequate knowledge regarding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy. However positive attitude and practices on preventive measures were good.

However, the effect that mood and anxiety disorders have on opioid use postpartum has received little attention in the literature. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association of mood and anxiety disorders with filling opioid prescriptions within the first 3 months postpartum. Methods: A retrospective cohort study (n = 25 279) was completed using claims data for a sample of privately insured women who gave birth in the state of Iowa. The interactive effects of mood and anxiety disorders and delivery mode on filling at least one and two or more opioid prescriptions were examined in logistic regression models. Results: The presence of mood and anxiety disorders among women who delivered vaginally increased their odds of filling at least one opioid fill by nearly 50% (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-1.63) and by 20% (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00-1.43) among women with cesarean delivery. Discussion and Conclusion: Postpartum women with mood and anxiety disorders were more likely to fill opioid prescriptions postpartum compared to women without these conditions. Scientific Significance: This study extends prior research by examining the intersection of risk of mood and anxiety disorders and opioid use postpartum. Findings from this study support the need for future research to identify the drivers of increased opioid use among postpartum women with mood and anxiety disorders.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of nulliparous women delivering term, singleton, vertex neonates at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 1/1/2016 to 6/30/2017. Women with cesarean for elective, malpresentation, or previa were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for maternal, neonatal, and facility factors were used to assess the likelihood of cesarean by race/ethnicity. Further modeling was performed to examine odds of cesarean for the indications of failure to progress and fetal intolerance by race/ethnicity. Results: The cohort of 16,587 racially/ethnically diverse women meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria consisted of 41.62% White, 27.73% Asian, 22.11% Hispanic, 5.32% Black, and 3.21% multiple race/other women. In adjusted logistic regression models, all race and ethnic categories had higher odds of cesarean deliveries in comparison to White women. Black women had the highest odds of cesarean delivery (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.45-2.06), followed by Asian (aOR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.45-2.06), multiple race/other (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.17-1.80), and Hispanic (aOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.28-1.59) women. Compared with White women, Asian (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.22-1.74) and Hispanic (aOR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03-1.52) women had higher odds of failure to progress as the indication. Among women with failure to progress, Black (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30-0.81), Hispanic (aOR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53-0.87), and Asian (aOR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61-0.96) women were less likely than White women to reach 10 cm dilation. Compared with White women, Black women were more likely to have cesarean delivery for fetal intolerance (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10-2.07). Among women with fetal intolerance of labor, there were no significant differences by race/ethnicity for Apgar score or neonatal intensive care unit admission. Conclusions: Race/ethnicity was significantly associated with the odds of cesarean and indication. All other race/ethnicity groups had higher odds of cesarean compared with White women. Compared with White women, Black women had greater odds of fetal intolerance as an indication, while Hispanic and Asian women had greater odds of failure to progress.

Our objective was to assess feasibility of three designs (preference trial [PCT], randomized controlled trial [RCT], partially randomized patient preference trial [PRPPT]) for a trial comparing planned delivery mode in low-risk women. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of low-risk, nulliparous pregnant women (N = 416) and healthcare providers (N = 168) providing prenatal care and/or labor/delivery services was conducted in Argentina (2 public, 2 private hospitals). Proportion of pregnant women and providers willing to participate in each design and reasons for not participating were determined. Results: Few women (< 15%) or professionals (33.3%) would participate in an RCT, though more would participate in PCTs (88% women; 65.9% professionals) or PRPPTs (44.4% public, 63.4% private sector women; 44.0% professionals). However, most women would choose vaginal delivery in the PCT and PRPPT (> 85%). Believing randomization unacceptable (RCT, PRPPT) and desiring choice of delivery mode (RCT) were women's reasons for not participating. For providers, commonly cited reasons for not participating included unacceptability of performing CS without medical indication, difficulty obtaining informed consent, discomfort enrolling patients (all designs), and violating women's right to choose (RCT). Conclusions for Practice: Important limitations were found for each trial design evaluated. The necessity of stronger evidence regarding delivery mode in low-risk women suggests consideration of additional designs, such as a rigorously designed cohort study or an RCT within an obstetric population with equivocal CS indications.

Although there are many benefits of kangaroo care (KC) intervention between the mother and the newborn, there is a limited number of studies on the KC intervention between the newborn and the father after caesarean section in international literature, and there are none in Turkey. This study was carried out to determine the effect of fathers and infants who participated in KC, immediately after birth by caesarean section, on paternal-infant attachment and the fathers' involvement in infant care in the 12th month. The study was conducted as a longitudinal study with a control group. Initially, the sample consisted of 60 fathers. However, the study was completed with 48 fathers. KC intervention was practised to the couple of the father and the infant in the experimental group, while no practice was given to the control group. Fathers in the experimental group were told that they should continue to practice KC intervention at least two times a week until their baby will be 1-year-old. The data collection forms were given to fathers face-to-face in the first interview, and then through phone calls and emails after 12 months. The status of the fathers in the experimental group fathers' involvement in infant care of the baby (p = .005) was significantly higher than the control group. The mean score for the Postnatal Paternal-Infant Attachment Questionnaire (PPAQ), in fathers who participated in KC intervention, was higher than that of fathers who did not participate in the KC intervention (p < .005). The results of this study demonstrated that the paternal-infant attachment and the fathers' participation in infant care were more positive in fathers and babies who performed the KC intervention.

After delivery and 4 weeks later, 311 women filled out two questionnaires of our design related to risk factors for PPD. Immune Power Personality Questionnaire, Walsh Family Resilience Questionnaire, and Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale were also applied. The predictors of PPD identified at two time points included: use of antidepressants, previous depressive episodes, family history of depression, risk of preterm delivery, anxiety about child's health, and breastfeeding and sleep problems. Risk factors for PPD found only after delivery were: suicidal ideation before pregnancy, stressful life events, premature rupture of the membranes, and cesarean section. Inhalation analgesia during labor reduced the PPD frequency. At 4 weeks' postpartum, regular physical activity was also predictive of PPD, while breastfeeding, financial satisfaction, and sufficient sleep duration were protective factors. PPD after delivery was negatively correlated with capacity to confide, hardiness, assertiveness, self-complexity, and communication. PPD at 4 weeks postpartum decreased belief systems, organization patterns, and communication. Two proposed self-designed questionnaires can be useful for effectively screening PPD in the Polish population.

The Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised, subscale Satisfaction with Delivery from the Childbirth Perception Questionnaire, and a set of questions on demographic and obstetric data were administered. The results showed the excellent fit of both the three-factor model (Stress experienced during labour, Women's personal attributes, Quality of care) and two-factor model (with Stress and Women's attributes combined into one factor), with no significant difference between the two models. Furthermore, bi-factor modeling revealed a general factor of childbirth experience, which explains the variance of items from Stress and Women's attributes subscales. The internal consistency was high for the total scale and Quality of care, while acceptable for the other two subscales. Convergent and divergent validity was high. Known-group discriminant validity showed that women who gave birth by unassisted vaginal birth and planned caesarean section reported higher levels of birth satisfaction. In conclusion, both empirical findings and theoretical background suggest a three-factor model as the better solution for the Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised conceptualization.

Studies have documented associations between cesarean section deliveries and autism spectrum disorder but have not comprehensively accounted for medical risks. This study evaluates the extent to which cesarean section and induced deliveries are associated with autism spectrum disorder in low-risk births. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, California's birth records (1992-2012) were linked to hospital discharge records to identify low-risk births using a stringent algorithm based on Joint Commission guidelines. Autism spectrum disorder status was based on California Department of Developmental Service data. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between autism spectrum disorder and induced vaginal deliveries, cesarean section deliveries not following induction, and cesarean section deliveries following induction, with noninduced vaginal deliveries as the reference category. Results: A total of 1,488,425 low-risk births took place in California from 1992 to 2012. The adjusted odds of autism spectrum disorder were 7% higher for induced vaginal deliveries (AOR=1.07, 95% CI=1.01, 1.14), 26% higher for cesarean section deliveries not following induction (AOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.19, 1.33), and 31% higher for cesarean section deliveries following induction (AOR=1.31, 95% CI=1.18, 1.45) than for noninduced vaginal deliveries. Lower gestational age and neonatal morbidities did not appear to be important underlying pathways. The associations were insensitive to alternative model specifications and across subpopulations. These results suggest that, in low-risk pregnancies, up to 10% of autism spectrum disorder cases are potentially preventable by avoiding cesarean section deliveries. Conclusions: After accounting for medical risks, elective deliveries--particularly cesarean section deliveries--were associated with a substantially increased risk of autism spectrum disorder.

To address this question, we compared pain scores and opioid analgesic utilization during delivery hospitalization in women taking their pre-hospital dose of buprenorphine who delivered by cesarean section to matched controls. To inform future research efforts, we also began to explore opioid analgesic utilization and pain scores by type of anesthesia as this variable is often not included in related literature. Methods: Retrospective matched cohort study of 46 women prescribed buprenorphine during pregnancy who delivered by cesarean section during a 7-year period. Results: When compared to matched controls, women taking their pre-hospital dose of buprenorphine undergoing cesarean section utilized more opioid analgesics as measured by morphine milligram equivalents (MME) (mean MME first 48 hours 153.0 mg vs 175.1 mg, respectively, P < .01) but had similar pain scores during delivery hospitalization. There was no difference in MME utilization by maternal dose of buprenorphine though sample sizes were small. Women on buprenorphine who received spinal anesthesia with morphine had mean pain scores that were 1.4 points lower (P = .01) during the first 48 hours than women on buprenorphine receiving other methods of anesthesia. Discussion And Conclusions: Pregnant women taking their pre-hospital dose of buprenorphine throughout their surgical delivery hospitalization were able to achieve pain relief similar to women not on MOUD but had higher MME requirements. Our results add to the emerging body of evidence suggesting that individuals on MOUD can achieve adequate post-surgical pain management without adjusting their pre-hospital dose of buprenorphine. Further research is required to fully understand the optimal buprenorphine dosing regimen during surgical hospitalizations. Our results also provide important preliminary evidence that spinal anesthesia containing opioids can be used effectively in individuals with OUD requiring surgical intervention.

The serotonin transporter (SERT) may be involved in the emergence of depressive symptoms postpartum and during other sex-hormone transitions. It may be associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the main serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA). In 100 healthy pregnant women, who were scheduled to deliver by cesarean section (C-section), we evaluated 5-HIAA and estradiol contributions to mental distress 5 weeks postpartum. Methods: Eighty-two women completed the study. CSF collected at C-section was analyzed for 5-HIAA, with high performance liquid chromatography. Serum estradiol concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before C-section and postpartum. Postpartum mental distress was evaluated with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Associations between EPDS, 5-HIAA, and Destradiol were evaluated in linear regression models adjusted for age, parity and SERT genotype. Results: Higher levels of postpartum mental distress symptoms were negatively associated with a large decrease in estradiol concentrations (bDE2 = 0.73, p = 0.007) and, on a trend level, positively associated with high antepartum 5-HIAA levels (b5-HIAA = 0.002, p = 0.06). Conclusion: In a cohort of healthy pregnant women, postpartum mental distress was higher in women with high antepartum 5-HIAA (trend) and lower in women with a large perinatal estradiol decrease. We speculate that high antepartum 5-HIAA is a proxy of SERT levels, that carry over to the postpartum period and convey susceptibility to mental distress. In healthy women, the postpartum return to lower estradiol concentrations may promote mental wellbeing.

The place, where expectant mothers choose to deliver their babies has a direct effect on maternal health outcomes. In sub-Saharan Africa, existing literature has shown that some women attend antenatal care during pregnancy but choose to deliver their babies at home. Using the Andersen and Newman Behavioural Model, this study explored the institutional and socio-cultural factors motivating women to deliver at home after attending antenatal care. Methods: A qualitative, exploratory, cross-sectional design was deployed. Data were collected from a purposive sample of 23 women, who attended antenatal care during pregnancy but delivered their babies at home, 10 health workers and 17 other community-level stakeholders. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Results: In line with the Andersen and Newman Model, the study discovered that traditional and religious belief systems about marital fidelity and the role of the gods in childbirth, myths about consequences of facility-based delivery, illiteracy, and weak women's autonomy in healthcare decision-making, predisposed women to home delivery. Home delivery was also enabled by inadequate midwives at health facilities, the unfriendly attitude of health workers, hidden charges for facility-based delivery, and long distances to healthcare facilities. The fear of caesarean section, also created the need for women who attended antenatal care to deliver at home. Conclusion: The study has established that socio-cultural and institutional level factors influenced women's decisions to deliver at home. We recommend a general improvement in the service delivery capacity of health facilities, and the implementation of collaborative educational and women empowerment programmes by stakeholders, to strengthen women's autonomy and reshape existing traditional and religious beliefs facilitating home delivery.

OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe subgroups of pregnant women with IDD according to social, health, and disability-related factors and examine the risks of perinatal complications in these subgroups compared to women without IDD. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, of women with (n = 1922) and without (n = 1,126,854) IDD, with a singleton birth in 2003-2018. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subgroups of women according to social (e.g., age), health (e.g., chronic medical conditions), and disability-related (e.g., IDD type) characteristics. Modified Poisson regression was then used to compare the risks of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, and preterm birth across identified subgroups to women without IDD. RESULTS: The LCA identified 4 classes of women with IDD: (1) young women who were mostly healthy and had little primary care before pregnancy (n = 253); (2) older women who were mostly healthy (n = 795); (3) young to mid-aged women who had significant comorbidities (n = 181); and (4) young women, many of whom were autistic, who had some medical comorbidities and significant psychiatric comorbidities (n = 693). Class 3 consistently had the greatest risks of perinatal complications, across all IDD groups, compared to women without IDD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of multidisciplinary care approaches tailored to the needs of at-risk women with IDD, in the preconception and perinatal periods.

We evaluated prospectively the association between CS and infant temperament across the first 9 postpartum months, controlling for indications for CS and investigating parity and infant sex as moderators. Methods: The sample consisted of mothers and their healthy infants. Infant temperament was measured using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire completed by the mothers at 6 weeks (n = 452) and 9 months (n = 258) postpartum. Mode of birth was classified into spontaneous vaginal birth (n = 347 for 6 weeks sample; 197 for 9 months sample), CS planned for medical reasons (n = 55; 28) and emergency CS (n = 50; 33). Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed no main effects of birth mode, but showed a significant interaction between birth mode and parity indicating that emergency CS in firstborn infants was associated with more difficult temperament at 6 weeks. There were no significant associations between indications for CS and infant temperament, although breech presentation predicted difficult temperament at 9 months. Conclusion: We largely failed to support the association between CS and infant temperament. Although our results suggest that emergency CS may be associated with temperament in firstborns, further research is needed to replicate this finding, preferably using observational measures to assess child temperament.

Systematic reviews on these associations lack consistent findings, which is why further research is required. We examined the associations between psychological distress, mode of birth, epidural analgesia, and duration of labor. Data from 3619 women with singleton pregnancies, from the population-based FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were analyzed. Maternal psychological distress was measured during pregnancy at 24 and 34 weeks, using the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised 2 (PRAQ-R2) and its subscale 'Fear of Giving Birth' (FOC), the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Mode of birth, epidural analgesia, and labor duration were obtained from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Maternal psychological distress, when captured with PRAQ-R2, FOC, and SCL-90, increased the likelihood of women having an elective cesarean section (OR: 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p = .003; OR: 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.20, p < .001; OR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.10, p = .001), but no association was detected for instrumental delivery or emergency cesarean section. A rise in both the PRAQ-R2, and FOC measurements increased the likelihood of an epidural analgesia (OR: 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p = .003; OR: 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.12, p < .001) and predicted longer second stage of labor (OR: 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01, p = .023; OR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05, p < .001). EPDS did not predict any of the analyzed outcomes. The results indicate that maternal anxiety symptoms (measured using PRAQ-R2, FOC, and SCL-90) are associated with elective cesarean section. Psychological distress increases the use of epidural analgesia, but is not associated with complicated vaginal birth.

The data were analyzed using measures of central tendency and risk assessed using odds ratio. Data on 1607 admissions were used to describe the spectrum of morbidity in hospitalized infants. Eight hundred and seven (50%) male and 754 (48%) female neonates were admitted. There was a 15% (240) readmission rate during the neonatal period. Infants of diabetic mothers were almost three times as likely to be admitted as infants whose mothers were not diabetic OR 2.89 (CI 1.96 - 4.13). Infants of women who were hypertensive were 1.5 times more likely to be admitted than infants of non-hypertensive women OR 1.56 (CI 1.56-1.9). The odds ratio for admission of an infant born to a woman delivered by caesarean section was 2.1 (CI: 1.67-2.38). Premature infants constituted 50% of admissions. The most prevalent discharge diagnosis included presumed sepsis, respiratory distress and neonatal jaundice in both preterm and term neonates. In the extreme preterm infant respiratory distress syndrome was the most predominant discharge diagnosis. Multiple gestation was a significant risk for admission OR 2.7 (CI 1.8 to 3.9). Prematurity, multiple gestation, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, maternal hypertension and low 5 minute Apgar score < 7 were all found to be independent predictors of neonatal admission in a logistic regression model (p < 0.001).

Este riesgo se ha incrementado durante la pandemia de COVID-19, habiendo diferencias en los sintomas psicologicos en el embarazo y el puerperio antes y despues de la pandemia. Los problemas de salud mental pueden tener efectos perjudiciales tanto en la mujer como en el recien nacido, como abortos espontaneos, partos prematuros, bajo peso al nacer y tasas mas altas de cesareas y partos asistidos. Objetivo: Evaluar la prevalencia de sintomas psicologicos de gestantes antes y durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Metodo: Se realizo un estudio transversal para evaluar el perfil psicologico en una muestra de mujeres embarazadas seleccionadas antes de la pandemia y una muestra de mujeres estudiadas durante la primera ola de la pandemia. Se selecciono un total de 122 mujeres antes de la pandemia y 181 mujeres durante el brote de COVID-19. Se utilizo la Inventario de Verificacion de Sintomas-90 Revisada (SCL-90-R) para evaluar la depresion y la ansiedad durante el embarazo y el puerperio. Resultados: La prevalencia de sintomas de depresion y ansiedad durante el embarazo fue mayor en la muestra de mujeres estudiadas durante la pandemia (SCL-90-R: M = 54.6 vs. 42.6 y M = 62.6 vs. 51.7 respectivamente).

Methods: A cohort of 181 women with live births was followed up for 6 months after delivery. Enquiry about the time of first intercourse after childbirth, associated dyspareunia, use of contraception, etc was made during the postnatal clinic visits and/or by telephone contact. Results: Fifty (27.6%) had coitus within six weeks of childbirth, it increased to 115 (63.3%) at three months and 127 (70.2%) by six months post-delivery. Prevalence of dyspareunia was 36.2%.

Aiming to fill this gap, we proposed and examined a process model through which maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact after birth reduces PTSS-FC by decreasing negative emotions, especially for women who had operative births. Method: In this longitudinal study, pregnant women (N = 1833) were recruited at community and hospital medical centres in the center of Israel and through internet forums. At Time 1, during pregnancy, they rated their prenatal depressive symptoms which served as an indicator for prenatal vulnerabilities. At Time 2, two-months postpartum (N = 1371, 75% of the sample), they reported their mode of birth, whether they had skin-to-skin contact with their newborn after birth, their emotions during birth, and rated their current PTSS-FC. A moderated mediation analysis was used to examine the proposed model. Results: Guilt and fear during birth mediated the association between mode of birth (instrumental or cesarean versus vaginal) and PTSS-FC. Skin-to-skin contact was related to reduced feelings of guilt and fear during birth, especially for women who had a cesarean section. Conclusions: Our results recognize the specific emotions that contribute to the development of PTSS-FC following operative births and show how skin-to-skin contact can possibly reduce them. As such they emphasize the importance of the implementation of skin-to-skin contact following childbirth, and especially following a cesarean section as recommended by the Baby Friendly Health Initiative (World Health Organization & UNICEF, 2009).

Because of the lack of a laboratory-based diagnostic strategy, antenatal depression is mainly determined by a psychologist's subjective judgment based on a structured clinical interview for established diagnostic criteria. However, the diagnostic accuracy rate for depression by non-psychiatrists is relatively low. Thus, this study aimed to use lipidomics to identify potential biomarkers related to antenatal depression in women who have undergone caesarean section. Methods: The study was designed as a matched prospective observational study. Singleton pregnant women scheduled to receive elective caesarean section, were screened for eligibility. Women diagnosed with major antenatal depression were matched with non-antenatal depression controls in terms of age (+-1 year) and BMI (+- 1 kg/m2), and blood samples of the included matched pairs were collected. Subsequently, lipidomics of the plasma samples were performed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to explore the differentially expressed lipids in women with or without antenatal depression. Results: In total, 484 pregnant women were screened; 66 subjects were recruited, including 33 subjects with major antenatal depression and 33 matched controls without antenatal depression. Thirty-five differentially expressed lipid metabolites were identified (P < 0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of these lipid metabolites was 0.7 or larger; the area under curve for cholesterol sulfate was 0.823 (95% CI: 0.716-0.930), and that of PC (18:2 (2E, 4E)/0:0) was 0.778 (95%CI: 0.662-0.895). In the conditional logistic stepwise regression analysis, cholesterol sulfate (P = 0.009) and PC (18:2 (2E, 4E)/0:0) (P = 0.035) were also identified as effective predictive risk factors for antenatal depression. Conclusions: Women who had undergone caesarean section and experienced antenatal depression presented a significantly differentially expressed profile of plasma lipidomics compared to those who did not experience antenatal depression. Cholesterol sulfate and PC (18:2 (2E, 4E)/0:0) may be effective and specific lipidic biomarkers for the prediction of antenatal depression.

Maternal-infant dyads with dual burden of severe maternal morbidity and preterm birth experience high physical and psychological morbidity, and the risk of dual burden varies by insurance type. We examined whether sociodemographic and perinatal risk factors of dual burden differed by insurance type. Methods: We estimated relative risks of dual burden by maternal sociodemographic and perinatal characteristics in the 2007-2012 California birth cohort dataset stratified by insurance type and compared effects across insurance types using Wald Z-statistics. Results: Dual burden ranged from 0.36% of privately insured births to 0.41% of uninsured births. Obstetric comorbidities, multiple gestation, parity, and birth mode conferred the largest risks across all insurance types, but effect magnitude differed. The adjusted relative risk of dual burden associated with preeclampsia superimposed on preexisting hypertension ranged from 9.1 (95% CI 7.6-10.9) for privately insured to 15.9 (95% CI 9.1-27.6) among uninsured. The adjusted relative risk of dual burden associated with cesarean birth ranged from 3.1 (95% CI 2.7-3.5) for women with Medi-Cal to 5.4 (95% CI 3.5-8.2) for women with other insurance among primiparas, and 7.0 (95% CI 6.0-8.3) to 19.4 (95% CI 10.3-36.3), respectively, among multiparas. Conclusions: Risk factors of dual burden differed by insurance type across sociodemographic and perinatal factors, suggesting that care quality may differ by insurance type. Attention to peripartum care access and care quality provided by insurance type is needed to improve maternal and neonatal health.

However, little research exists on whether positive factors such as social support and the happiness of the mother-partner relationship are associated with lower rates of infant fussiness or colic. Objectives: We investigated the association between infant colic and three types of maternal support: general maternal social support (during pregnancy and post partum), the happiness of the mother-partner relationship (during pregnancy and post partum) and partner involvement in caring for the newborn. Methods: Participants were 3006 women in the First Baby Study, a prospective study of the effect of mode of first delivery on subsequent childbearing. Women were interviewed by telephone during pregnancy and 1 month after first childbirth and asked about social support and if their baby had a variety of problems since birth, including 'Colic - crying or fussiness three or more hours a day'. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to model the association between maternal support and infant colic, controlling for confounders, including maternal race or ethnicity, insurance, marital status, smoking, mode of delivery, maternal post-partum depression, breastfeeding, other neonatal illnesses and newborn gestational age. Results: Infant colic was reported by 11.6% of new mothers. High general maternal social support (in comparison with low), measured during pregnancy, was associated with lower reported infant colic (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40-0.75) and measured post partum (AOR, 0.51, 95% CI, 0.39-0.67); high relationship happiness (in comparison with low), measured during pregnancy (AOR, 0.71, 95% CI, 0.54-0.93), and measured post partum (AOR, 0.22, 95% CI, 0.12-0.40); and high partner involvement with newborn care (in comparison with low) (AOR, 0.60, 95% CI, 0.44-0.81). Conclusion: Higher levels of maternal social support during pregnancy and post partum are associated with lower rates of maternal reported infant colic.

There is a dearth of data from controlled studies regarding level, prevalence, risk, and predictors of these symptoms in parents after preterm birth. Methods: As part of the longitudinal HaFEn-study, data from parents of infants with very low birth weight (VLBW), and term infants were cross-sectionally analyzed. We recruited parents at the three largest perinatal care centers in Hamburg, Germany. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed with a standardized questionnaire, and acute and posttraumatic stress disorders with a clinical interview one month postpartum. Stress during birth, lifetime psychiatric diagnoses, social support, pregnancy risks, and mode of delivery were also evaluated. To examine predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms in both parents simultaneously, we constructed multiple random coefficient models. Results: 230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. The risk for acute stress disorder was increased in mothers with VLBW infants but not in fathers. While the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder was not elevated, the level of posttraumatic stress symptoms was higher in both parents with VLBW infants. Predictors for posttraumatic stress symptoms were stress during birth, low social support, psychiatric lifetime diagnoses, the birth of a VLBW infant, and female parent sex. Limitations: Results reported here are cross-sectional. Thus, no temporal relationships can be established. Conclusions: Although posttraumatic stress disorders were rare, our results suggest that posttraumatic stress symptoms and acute stress disorders are common in parents of VLBW infants.

theassociationbetweencaesareansectionandcognitiveabilityinchildhood;2020;hanrahan,the association between caesarean section and cognitive ability in childhood,2020.0,"Hanrahan, Michael;McCarthy, Fergus, P.;O'Keeffe, Gerard, W.;Khashan, Ali, S.","Purpose: Global rates of caesarean section (CS) rates have increased rapidly in recent years. This is a growing public health concern as it has been proposed that CS may impact cognitive outcomes in childhood. However, the evidence for this association is limited and inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between obstetric mode of delivery and longitudinal cognitive outcomes in childhood. Methods: We examined this question using data from a longitudinal cohort study of 8845 participants from the Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative UK cohort, who completed a range of verbal and visual-spatial cognitive assessments at ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 years. Results: We found a statistically significant association between planned CS and visual-spatial cognitive delay in the pattern construction assessment at age 5 (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99-1.72) and age 7 (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.12-1.81). Additionally planned CS was also associated with increased odds of 'early childhood delay' (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.15-2.50) and borderline increased odds of 'persistent delay' (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.99-1.89) in visual-spatial cognitive tests. Mode of delivery was not associated with verbal ability or with patterns of delay at any age point in verbal cognitive tests. Conclusion: We have reported a small association between planned CS and visual-spatial cognitive delay in childhood. However, while this result should be interpreted with caution, it highlights the need to further explore this potential relationship and the causal basis of such an association.

obesityandtheincreasingoddsofcesareandelivery;2022;class,obesity and the increasing odds of cesarean delivery,2022.0,"Class, Quetzal, A.","Background: Knowledge of the associations between obesity and cesarean delivery (CD) is limited by previous research that does not separate the highest BMI classes. Methods: We identified 25,604 pregnancies in retrospective electronic medical records at an inner-city academic hospital between 2000 and 2015. We examined the association between BMI at pre-pregnancy and delivery, as well as gestational weight gain (GWG), and rates of CD, gestational diabetes mellitus (GD), and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) using logistic regression and chi-square. Results: CD increased with each increase in delivery BMI class [X2 (7, N = 25,604) =151.40, p < .0001]. GD and PIH also significantly increased across each BMI class. Each increasing BMI class predicted 1.21 times greater odds of CD even after adjusting for maternal age, year of birth, GD, and PIH [OR = 1.21 (95% CI, 1.07-1.37)]. As compared with the IOM recommended GWG, less weight gain offered mitigation of CD and GD, though less than the recommended GWG for women who were obese pre-pregnancy also increased odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Conclusions: Increasing BMI is associated with increasing rates of adverse obstetric outcomes. There exists a 'dose-dependent' effect of BMI on CD and limiting GWG may be associated with mitigated risk for this outcome, but increased risk for offspring adverse birth outcomes.

However, it is not clear if there are specific risk gene interactions with particular pre-, peri-, and postnatal risk factors for distinct disorders, such as adult attention-deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (aADHD) and bipolar disorder (BD). In this pilot study, the first aim was to investigate retrospective self-reports of pre-, peri-, and postnatal complications and risk factors from 126 participants (aADHD, BD, and healthy controls) and their mothers. The second aim was to investigate possible interaction between the previously published common risk gene variants of ADHD in the ADGRL3 (= LPHN3) gene (rs2305339, rs1397548, rs734644, rs1397547, rs2271338, rs6551665, and rs2345039) and shared risk gene variants of aADHD and BD in the DGKH gene (DGKH rs994856/rs9525580/rs9525584 GAT haplotype) and pre-, peri-, and postnatal risk factors in comparison to a healthy control group. After correction for multiple comparison, the following pre-, peri-, and postnatal risk factors remained statistically significant (p <= 0.0036) between healthy controls and ADHD and BD patients as one group: unplanned pregnancies, psychosocial stress of the mother during pregnancy, mode of delivery, shared decision-making regarding medical procedures during the delivery, perinatal bonding, number of crybabies, and quality of mother-child and father-child relationship. There were no significant environment-gene interactions. In our preliminary data, similar risk factors were found to be significantly associated with both disorders in comparison to healthy controls. However, larger and longitudinal studies and standardized and validated instruments to get a better understanding of the interaction of pre-, peri-, and postnatal complications and mental health in the offspring are needed.

Method: This was a national capture-recapture calculation-corrected surveillance and nested case-control study. Infants born preterm and at term with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed neonatal CSVT were identified by surveillance in all paediatric hospitals in Germany (2015-2017). Incidence was corrected for underreporting using a capture-recapture method in one federal state and then extrapolated nationwide. We reviewed PubMed for comparisons with previously reported incidence estimators. We used a population-based perinatal database for quality assurance to select four controls per case and applied univariate and multivariable regression for risk factor analysis. Results: Fifty-one newborn infants (34 males, 17 females; 14 born preterm) with neonatal CSVT were reported in the 3-year period. The incidence of term and preterm neonatal CSVT was 6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-8.7) per 100 000 live births. Median age at time of confirmation of the diagnosis was 9.95 days (range 0-39d). In the univariate analysis, male sex, preterm birth, hypoxia and related indicators (umbilical artery pH <7.1; 5-minute Apgar score <7; intubation/mask ventilation; perinatal asphyxia), operative vaginal delivery, emergency Caesarean section, and pathological fetal Doppler sonography were associated (p < 0.05) with neonatal CSVT. Multivariable regression yielded hypoxia (odds ratio = 20.3; 95% CI 8.1-50.8) as the independent risk factor. Interpretation: Incidence of neonatal CSVT was within the range of other population-based studies. The results suggest that hypoxia is an important perinatal risk factor for the aetiology of neonatal CSVT.

The effect of COVID-19 on obstetric and perinatal outcomes is yet to be completely ascertained. A hospital-based prospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, AIIMS Rishikesh from July to December 2020. A total of 60 COVID-positive pregnant women were included. Obstetric and perinatal outcomes were compared with 60 COVID-negative pregnant women. A subgroup comparison was also performed between symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with COVID-19. Majority of COVID-positive pregnant women were asymptomatic (81.7%). Eleven patients were symptomatic, out of which 9 (15%) had mild disease and only 2 (3.3%) had severe pneumonia. There was an increased likelihood of early pregnancy loss (5%), oligohydramnios (21.7%), preterm birth (31.7%), and cesarean section (53.3%). The occurrence of preterm birth was significantly higher in symptomatic women than asymptomatic women (p = .01). Oligohydramnios was significantly more frequent in COVID-positive than COVID-negative pregnant women (p = .048). Preterm birth and cesarean rate were slightly higher in COVID-positive group but the difference was not statistically significant. Other obstetric outcomes were comparable in both groups. The majority of women with COVID-19 infection in pregnancy remain asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Still, it may lead to maternal death and poor fetal outcomes in form of early pregnancy loss, prematurity, oligohydramnios, intrapartum fetal distress, and increased cesarean rate. Therefore, COVID-19 preventive measures should be strictly implemented and followed.

One important contributor to the rise in Csection rates is the rapid expansion of unregulated private-sector providers in number of settings. This study analyses the contribution of private sector in the rapid rise in Csection deliveries in India and the extent to which these can be justified on medical grounds. Methods: This is a cross sectional study design using National Family Health Surveys. Logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses are performed. The main outcome measured is avoidable C-sections in the private sector. Principal findings: Our findings suggest that the rising trend in C-section rates in the private sector cannot be explained by medical reasons alone. The odds of C-section among women who chose to deliver in private was over 4 times higher than women who chose to delivery in public facilities. Despite, controlling for medical complications, women's characteristics and preferences, our PSM analysis suggest that the public-private gap has doubled over the years and that the difference cannot be explained by known determinants of C-section. Over supply of avoidable C-section to the extent of 21%, as a result of physician induced demand and perverse financial incentives was observed in the private sector. Conclusions: This paper attempts to understand the reason for the high C-section rates in the private sector in India and the extent to which these are avoidable. Our analysis supports the assumption that physician induced demand as a result of perverse financial incentives in the private sector is at play.

In the original article, surname of the second author was inaccurate. Angelica Linden Hirschberg should be referred to as Dr Hirschberg, not Dr Linden Hirschberg. The error has been corrected.] Importance: The prevalence of eating disorders is high among women of reproductive age, yet the association of eating disorders with pregnancy complications and neonatal health has not been investigated in detail, to our knowledge. Objective: To investigate the relative risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes for women with eating disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study included all singleton births included in the Swedish Medical Birth Register from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014. A total of 7542 women with eating disorders were compared with 1 225 321 women without eating disorders. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to April 30, 2019. Via linkage with the national patient register, women with eating disorders were identified and compared with women free of any eating disorder. Eating disorders were further stratified into active or previous disease based on last time of diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (hyperemesis, anemia, preeclampsia, and antepartum hemorrhage), the mode of delivery (cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery, or instrumental vaginal delivery), and the neonatal outcomes (preterm birth, small and large sizes for gestational age, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, and microcephaly) were calculated using Poisson regression analysis to estimate risk ratios (RRs). Models were adjusted for age, parity, smoking status, and birth year. Results: There were 2769 women with anorexia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 29.4 [5.3] years), 1378 women with bulimia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [4.9] years), and 3395 women with an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS; mean [SD] age, 28.9 [5.3] years), and they were analyzed and compared with 1 225 321 women without eating disorders (mean [SD] age, 30.3 [5.2] years). All subtypes of maternal eating disorders were associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of hyperemesis during pregnancy (anorexia nervosa: RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.8-2.5]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.6-2.7]; EDNOS: RR, 2.6 [95%CI, 2.3-3.0]). The risk of anemia during pregnancy was doubled for women with active anorexia nervosa (RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.3-3.2]) or EDNOS (RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.5-2.8]). Maternal anorexia nervosa was associated with an increased risk of antepartum hemorrhage (RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.2-2.1]), which was more pronounced in active vs previous disease.Women with anorexia nervosa (RR, 0.7 [95%CI, 0.6-0.9]) and women with EDNOS (RR, 0.8 [95%CI, 0.7-1.0]) were at decreased risk of instrumental-assisted vaginal births; otherwise, there were no major differences in mode of delivery.Women with eating disorders, all subtypes, were at increased risk of a preterm birth (anorexia nervosa: RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.4-1.8]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 1.3 [95%CI, 1.0-1.6]; and EDNOS: RR, 1.4 [95%CI, 1.2-1.6]) and of delivering neonates with microcephaly (anorexia nervosa: RR, 1.9 [95%CI, 1.5-2.4]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.1-2.4]; EDNOS: RR, 1.4 [95%CI, 1.2-1.9]). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that women with active or previous eating disorders, regardless of subtype, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and may need increased surveillance in antenatal and delivery care.

However, identifying women with a high PPD risk and making a judgement as to the benefits of preventive intervention is a major challenge. Methods: This is a retrospective study of parturients that underwent a cesarean delivery. Control group was used as development cohort and validation cohort to construct the risk prediction model of PPD and determine a risk threshold. Ketamine group and development cohort were used to verify the risk classification of parturients by evaluating whether the incidence of PPD decreased significantly after ketamine treatment in high-risk for PPD population. Results: The AUC for the development cohort and validation cohort of the PPD prediction model were 0.751 (95%CI:0.700-0.802) and 0.748 (95%CI:0.680-0.816), respectively. A threshold of 19% PPD risk probability was determined, with a specificity and sensitivity in the validation cohort are 0.766 and 0.604, respectively. After matching the high-risk group and the low-risk group by propensity score, the results demonstrated that PPD incidence significantly reduced in the high-risk group following ketamine, versus non-ketamine, intervention (p < 0.01). In contrast, intervention in the low-risk group showed no significant difference in PPD outcomes (p > 0.01). Limitation: Randomized trials are needed to further verify the feasibility of the model and the thresholds proposed.

We explore associations between prenatal mood and birth perceptions in a socioeconomically diverse, American sample. Methods We conducted a prospective study of 136 predominantly low-income and ethnic minority women of mixed parity. Prenatal measures of perceived stress, pregnancy-related anxiety, and depressive symptoms were used to predict maternal perceptions of birth experiences 1 month postpartum, using the childbirth experience questionnaire (CEQ; 1). Results After adjusting for sociodemographic variables and mode of delivery, higher third-trimester stress predicted worse CEQ total scores. This association was predominantly explained by two CEQ domains: own capacity (e.g., feelings of control and capability), and perceived safety. Pregnancy-related anxiety and depressive symptoms correlated with perceived stress, though neither independently predicted birth experience. An unplanned cesarean delivery was associated with a worse CEQ total score. Vaginal delivery predicted greater perceived safety. Altogether, sociodemographic covariates, mode of delivery, and prenatal mood accounted for 35 percent of the variance in birth experience (p < 0.001). Discussion Our finding that prenatal stress explains a significant and likely clinically meaningful proportion of the variance in birth experience suggests that women perceive and recall their birth experiences through a lens that is partially determined by preexisting personal circumstances and emotional reserves. Since childbirth perceptions have implications for maternal and child health, patient satisfaction, and health care expenditures, these findings warrant consideration of prenatal stress screening to target intervention for women at risk for negative birth experiences.

Methods: Data were from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. A total of 5275 women aged 18-38 years, who had given birth to their first child between 1996 and 2012 were included; 75.0% (n = 3956) had delivered a second child. Mode of delivery for first and second singleton birth(s) was obtained from longitudinal survey data. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric and medical history variables were tested as predictors of mode of delivery for first and second births using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Caesarean sections accounted for 29.1% (n = 1535) of first births, consisting of 18.2% emergency and 10.9% elective caesareans. Mode of delivery for first and second births was consistent for 85.5% of women (n = 3383) who delivered both children either vaginally or via caesarean section. Higher maternal age and body mass index, short-stature, anxiety and having private health insurance were predictive of caesarean section for first births. Vaginal birth after caesarean section was more common in women who were older, short-statured, or had been overweight or obese for both children, compared to women who had two vaginal deliveries. Conclusions for Practice: Rates of caesarean section in Australia are high. Renewed efforts are needed to reduce the number of unnecessary caesarean births, with particular caution applied to first births. Interventions could focus on elective caesareans for women with private health insurance or a history of anxiety.

We examined whether women's prenatal attitudes toward vaginal delivery differed by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status, and whether attitudes were differently related to delivery mode depending on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Methods: Data were from the First Baby Study, a cohort of 3006 women who gave birth to a first baby in Pennsylvania between 2009 and 2011. We used regression models to examine (1) predictors of prenatal attitudes toward vaginal delivery, and (2) the association between prenatal attitudes and actual delivery mode. To assess moderation, we estimated models adding interaction terms. Results: Prenatal attitudes toward vaginal delivery were not associated with race/ ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Positive attitudes toward vaginal delivery were associated with lower odds of cesarean delivery (AOR = 0.60, P < .001). However, vaginal delivery attitudes were only related to delivery mode among women who were white, highly educated, and privately insured. Conclusions: There are racial/ethnic differences in chances of cesarean delivery, and these differences are not explained by birth attitudes. Furthermore, our findings suggest that white and high-socioeconomic status women may be more able to realize their preferences in childbirth.

Background: While circadian activities could change throughout pregnancy, studies exploring the effect of change in those activities on pregnancy outcomes remain limited. Design: This study applied a prospective panel design. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess the three activities before and during pregnancy and was administered three times from August 2015- July 2017. Multiple logistic regression models were used. The analysis included 488, 477 and 455 participants in the models for Caesarean section, medically indicated Caesarean section and small for gestational age, respectively. This study followed the STROBE guidelines. Results: The mean age of participants was 32.18 years, and more than half (54.90%) were primiparous. Sleep duration of >8 hr/day before pregnancy and experiencing a decrease in mid-pregnancy was a risk factor for Caesarean section and medically indicated Caesarean section. Sitting >=8 hr/weekday in pre-, mid- and late pregnancy had a protective effect for Caesarean section and medically indicated Caesarean section. Sitting <8 hr in mid-pregnancy and experiencing a decrease in late pregnancy was a risk factor for small-for-gestational-age infants. Physical activity was not significantly related to pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: Sleep duration of 7-8 hr and sitting time of more than 8 hr/day seem beneficial for women both before and during pregnancy. Relevance to clinical practice: Health professionals could assess pregnant women or those intending to become pregnant regarding their sleep and sitting behaviour and provide relevant interventions.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of women identified as reproductive travelers who delivered at Stroger Hospital in Chicago, IL when a self-pay package of obstetrical services was offered. Data included maternal characteristics and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Results: A total of 413 reproductive travelers delivered during the study period. The majority (88%) was of Nigerian citizenship. The median gestational age at first prenatal visit was 35 weeks with a median of three prenatal visits. The patients were in good health with a high prevalence of infectious disease and a low prevalence of chronic disease. Women had complex obstetric histories, and 28.6% had cesarean delivery, with the most common indication being prior uterine surgery. Severe maternal morbidity occurred in 4.1% of the women and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in 16.3% of the babies. Extra charges beyond those covered by the financial package were incurred by 230 (55.7%) of the women. Conclusion: Reproductive travelers have better obstetric outcomes and fewer NICU admissions than non-travelers who delivered at the same institution. However, the care of RTOC in this manner is fraught with challenges, including late presentation for care, lack of medical records, providers at times managing unfamiliar conditions, and unforeseen financial obligations assumed by patients.

Material and Method This prospective study was conducted with 70 healthy, nulliparous parturient with singleton pregnancies. Women at their 28-32. weeks of gestation were asked to fill a socio-demographic data form and the questionnaires; Personality Belief Questionnaire - Short Form (PBQ-SF) and The Childbirth Attitudes Questionnaire (CAQ). After delivery, all the results of pre-filled questionnaires and women's mode of delivery were analyzed and compared. Results There were significant differences in personality types; dependent (p = 0.033), passive-aggressive (p = 0.031), obsessive-compulsive (p = 0.001), antisocial (p = 0.014), narcissistic (p = 0.014) and borderline (p = 0.014) between vaginal delivery and CS groups. The CAQ scores of the mothers who requested CS were significantly higher (p:0.007). Weak but significant positive relation was found between total CAQ scores and avoidant (p = 0.022), dependent (p = 0.034), passive-aggressive (p = 0.040), narcissistic (p = 0,006), schizoid (p = 0.007), paranoid (p = 0.007) and borderline (p = 0.007) personality types. Conclusion This is the first study that investigates the relationship between mode of delivery and personality traits according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and cognitive behavioral perspective in the literature. These personality traits can be carried at a level that is not clinically significant to create an obvious pathology, yet they might play a role as the motives behind the apparent reasons for women who request CS. Understanding women's motives and attitudes for childbirth during their pregnancy may help healthcare providers to tailor women's approach to childbirth to avoid unnecessary CS.

Pregnancies with GDM have worse outcomes compared to pregnancies with normal glucose tolerance. The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of GDM and perinatal outcomes according to the old WHO criteria and IADPSG criteria. Subjects and methods: A retrospective study included 2,405 pregnant women who delivered between January 2009 and December 2010. According to the OGTT results, pregnant women were divided into 4 groups. We analyzed the prevalence of GDM, characteristics of pregnant women and their newborns and perinatal outcomes. Results: We found significantly higher prevalence of GDM according to the IADPSG criteria compared to the WHO criteria. Pregnant women with GDM were significantly older, had higher pre-pregnancy BMI, fasting and 2-h plasma glucose. Pregnant women with GDM had worse pregnancy outcomes compared to control group. The overall proportion of overweight and obese pregnant women was the highest in the group of untreated pregnant women with GDM according to the IADPSG criteria. In this group we found significantly higher rate of fetal macrosomia and LGA. The rate of caesarean section was significantly higher in comparison to control group. Pre-eclampsia was significantly more common in groups of pregnant women with GDM compared to control group. Conclusion: IADPSG diagnostic criteria reveals more women with hyperglycemic disorders in pregnancy. A group of pregnant women who were normoglycemic according to the WHO criteria, but according to the IADPSG were diagnosed GDM, had adverse pregnancy outcomes. Lower values of glycemia, than those defined for diabetes in pregnancy, are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

This study investigated the relationship between seasons and depression and anxiety symptoms, salivary cortisol concentrations, custom birthweight centiles (CBWC) and placenta weight for pregnant women living in South Wales. Methods: This study utilised data from the longitudinal Grown in Wales (GiW) cohort. Women were recruited at the presurgical elective caesarean section (ELCS) appointment, when they provided saliva samples and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Data on birthweight and placental weight was extracted from medical notes. Seasonal data was available for 316 participants. Results: No association was identified between seasons and EPDS (p = .178), STAI scores (p = .544), CBWC (p = .683) or placental weight (p = .857). Significance was identified between seasons and salivary cortisol concentration (p < .001), with highest levels in autumn and winter. Adjusted linear regression identified spring (B = -.05, p = .007, 95% CI -.09, -.01) and summer (B = -.06, p = .001, 95% CI -09, -.02) compared to autumn, and spring (B = -.05, p = .009, 95% CI -.09, -.01) and summer (B = -.06, p = .002, 95% CI -.10, -.02) compared to winter to be associated with decreased cortisol concentrations. Conclusion: This study found no association between season and maternally-reported mental health symptoms, birthweight by CBWC or placental weight but did between season and term salivary cortisol.

Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Embase to December 2018 and included nine hospital-based and population registry studies published in 2011-2018. These covered a total study cohort of more than 2.5 million people in eight countries: Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Turkey and the UK. The analysis provided summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) while taking heterogeneity into account. Results: We found that that C-sections were associated with a small increase in the risk of ADHD (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11, 1.17, I2 0%) in offspring. In subgroup analyses, the association remained for both infants born after elective C-sections (OR, 1.15, 1.11, 1.19, I2 0%) and emergency C-sections (OR, 1.13, 1.1, 1.17, I2 45.4%). However, these were only marginally significant when we pooled data from siblings from other pregnancies (OR, 1.06, 1.00-1.13, I2 0%), implying that the association was due to confounding. Conclusion: The statistically significant association between C-sections and ADHD in children can be partially explained by unmeasured confounding. Further research controlling for important confounders is required before firm conclusions can be drawn.

This study aimed to assess, among Chinese adolescents, the associations of habitual weekday sleep duration with depressive symptoms and whether these associations varied with the mode of birth delivery. Methods: Data were from the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey, and 150,053 students' questionnaires were qualified for analysis. Multi-level logistic regression models were performed. Results: A weekday sleep duration of <=5 h/night was associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.98, 95% CI = 2.75-3.24), and adolescents who reported a weekday sleep duration of 5-7 h/night (aOR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.60-1.79) and >9 h/night (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.11-1.45) were also at a higher risk of depressive symptoms. Stratification analyses showed that in both adolescents delivered by vaginal birth and cesarean section (CS), a weekday sleep duration of <=5 h/night, 5-7 h/night, and >9 h/night were associated with the increased risk of depressive symptoms in the adjusted models, and the magnitudes of the aORs in adolescents delivered by CS were slightly higher than those in adolescents delivered by vaginal birth. Limitations: The cross-sectional study design and self-reported sleep duration and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a significant U-shaped association between weekday sleep duration and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents. In both adolescents delivered by vaginal birth and CS, those who reported having abnormal sleep duration were at a high risk of depressive symptoms. Based on the findings of this study, we suggest sleep duration and mode of delivery should be a matter of concern for public health authorities.

Methods: The study used data from longitudinal national representative infant nutrition survey in Israel (n = 2119 participants). Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors and build predictive models. Results: The rate of exclusive breastfeeding cessation increased from 45.4% at 2 months to 85.7% at 6 months. Five factors were significantly associated with higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding cessation at 2 months: being a primapara, low educational level, lack of previous breastfeeding experience, negative attitude towards birth, and lack of intention to breastfeed. Six factors were significantly associated with higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding cessation at 6 months: younger age, being in a relationship with a partner, lower religiosity level, cesarean delivery, not taking folic acid during pregnancy, and negative attitude towards birth. Both 2 and 6-months models had good predictive performance (C-statistic of .72 and .68, accordingly). Conclusions for Practice: This nationwide study successfully identified several predictors of exclusive breastfeeding cessation and created breastfeeding cessation prediction tools for two time periods (2 and 6 months). The resulting tools can be applied to identify women at risk for stopping exclusive breastfeeding in hospitals or at community clinics. Further studies should examine practical aspects of applying these tools in practice and explore whether applying those tools can lead to higher exclusive breastfeeding rates.

The International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to identify deliveries, inpatient long-acting reversible contraception (IPP LARC), and postpartum tubal ligation (PPTL). We conducted univariable and multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between demographic, clinical, hospital and geographical characteristics with likelihood of LAPM including IPP LARC and PPTL.ResultsOur sample included 3,642,328 unweighted deliveries. The rate of IPP LARC increased from 34.6 to 54.9 per 10,000 deliveries (58.7%), while the rate of PPTL utilization decreased from 719.5 to 671.8 per 10,000 deliveries (6.6%) over the study period.

An internationally recognized classification system had been required to analyse the trend and its possible consequences in a standardized manner. The goal of this study was to identify the main contributors to the CD rate at the Medical University of Vienna in an 11-year time period (2003-2013) and to analyse neonatal outcome parameters within the ten Robson categories. Methods: This is a retrospective data-analysis of singleton and twin pregnancies in cephalic, breech and transverse presentation with a gestational age between 23 and 42 weeks. The cases were divided into ten classes based on the Robson criteria. CD rates and perinatal outcome parameters were analysed within each Robson class. The outcome parameters included: NICU-admission rate and 5 min Apgar score values < 7. Results: The overall CD rate was at 44.2%. Within Robson class 5 the CD rate was the highest at 99.1%. Main contributors were Robson class 5 at 20.6%, followed by class 2 at 17.1% and class 8 at 15.0%. Neonatal outcome analyses revealed significant differences between the Robson classes. Conclusions: The main contributors to the CD rate were determined. We suggest reconsidering the frequently applied birth mode especially for Robson class 2, 4, 5 and 8. Lowering the CD rate could be achievable, if a careful delivery management and an individual risk evaluation is provided. It is important to reduce the CD rate in the individual Robson classes under consideration of perinatal outcome parameters, since a reduction should only take place where it is clinically useful and relevant.

Background: Previously high caesarean section rate in China and the 'two children' policy leads to the situation where multiparas are faced with the choice of another caesarean or trial of labour after caesarean. Despite evidences showing the benefits of vaginal birth after caesarean, obstetricians and midwives in China tend to be conservative due to limited experience and insufficient clinical routines. Thus, its management needs further optimisation in order to make the practice safe and sound. Design: A prospective quality improvement programme using the healthcare failure mode and effect analysis. Methods: With the structured methodology of healthcare failure mode and effect analysis, we determined core processes of antepartum and intrapartum management, conducted risk priority numbers and devised remedial protocols for failure modes with high risks. The programme was then implemented as a clinical routine under the agreement of the institutional review board and vaginal birth after caesarean success rates were compared before and after the quality improvement programme, both descriptively and statistically. Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 checklist was chosen on reporting the study process. Results: Seventy failure modes in seven core processes were identified in the management process, with 14 redressed for actions. The 1-year follow-up trial of labour after caesarean and vaginal birth after caesarean rate was increased compared with the previous 3 years, with a vaginal birth after caesarean rate of 86.36%, whereas the incidence of uterine rupture was not compromised. Conclusions: The application of healthcare failure mode and effect analysis can not only promote trial of labour after caesarean and vaginal birth after caesarean rate, but also maintaining a low risk of uterine rupture. Relevance to clinical practice: This modified vaginal birth after caesarean management protocol has been shown effective in increasing its successful rate, which can be continued for further comparison of severe complications to the previous practice.

However, data regarding how women value the potential processes and outcomes of TOLAC and elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) are limited. We sought to determine how women view the processes and outcomes of TOLAC and ERCD and identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with these preferences. Materials and Methods: This is a multicenter cross-sectional study of mode of delivery preferences among TOLAC-eligible women at 26-34 weeks gestation. The time tradeoff metric was used to obtain utilities for the processes and outcomes of TOLAC and ERCD. Multivariable regression analysis was utilized to identify independent predictors of utilities. Results: The 299 study participants constituted a geographically and racially/ethnically diverse group. Although uncomplicated TOLAC resulting in vaginal birth after cesarean and uncomplicated ERCD resulted in high utility values, any alteration in either the process or outcome resulted in substantial utility decrements. In multivariable regression analysis, race/ethnicity, insurance status, and order of scenario presentation emerged as statistically significant predictors. Conclusions: Information regarding both maternal and infant implications is important to women in discussions about approach to delivery. Both the way in which information regarding labor interventions and potential complications is presented and the characteristics of the women contemplating this information affect its impact. These findings underscore the need for evidence-based decision support to help create realistic expectations and incorporate informed patient preferences into decision-making to optimize both clinical outcomes and individual patient experience for women with a prior cesarean delivery.

Furthermore, no previous study has expressed these outcomes in preference-based (utility) metrics. Methods: The study population comprised 2,161 mothers recruited from a prospective population-based study in the East Midlands of England encompassing live births and stillbirths between 32+0 and 36+6 weeks' gestation and a sample of term-born controls. Perinatal data were extracted from the mothers' maternity records. Health-related quality-of-life outcomes were assessed at 12 months postpartum, using the EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) measure with responses to the EQ-5D descriptive system converted into health utility scores. Descriptive statistics and multivariable analyses were used to estimate the relationship between the mode of delivery and health-related quality-of-life outcomes. Results: The overall health-related quality-of-life profile of the women in the study cohort mirrored that of the English adult population as revealed by national health surveys. A significantly higher proportion of women delivering by cesarean delivery reported some, moderate, severe, or extreme pain or discomfort at 12 months postpartum than women undergoing spontaneous vaginal delivery. Multivariable analyses, using the Ordinary Least Squares estimator revealed that, after controlling for maternal sociodemographic characteristics, cesarean delivery without maternal or fetal compromise was associated with a significant EQ-5D utility decrement in comparison to spontaneous vaginal delivery among all women ( 0.026; p = 0.038) and among mothers of term-born infants ( 0.062; p < 0.001). Among mothers of term-born infants, this result was replicated in models that controlled for all maternal and infant characteristics (utility decrement of 0.061; p < 0.001). The results were confirmed by sensitivity analyses that varied the categorization of the main exposure variable (mode of delivery) and the econometric strategy. Conclusions: Among mothers of term-born infants, cesarean delivery without maternal or fetal compromise is associated with poorer long-term health-related quality of life in comparison to spontaneous vaginal delivery. Further longitudinal studies are needed to understand the magnitude, trajectory, and underpinning mechanisms of health-related quality-of-life outcomes following different modes of delivery.

Methods: This retrospective study analyzed singleton pregnancies (n = 11,518) among women delivering at Boston Medical Center from January 2010-March 2015. Outcomes of interest included preterm birth, early preterm birth, cesarean delivery, hypertensive disorders, diabetes, low birth weight at term (LBW, < 2500 g), NICU admission and intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing outcomes between U.S.- and foreign-born women were calculated and stratified by race. Obstetric outcomes among Black and Hispanic women were compared to those of white women within both U.S.- and foreign-born groups. Results: Preterm birth, hypertensive disorders, LBW and NICU admission were more likely to occur among U.S.-born women and their neonates compared to foreign-born women. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics did not significantly impact these disparities. Among foreign-born women, Black women had a higher prevalence of many maternal and neonatal complications, while Hispanic women had a lower prevalence of some complications compared to white women. Black woman and infants consistently exhibit worse outcomes regardless of their nativity, while Hispanic women foreign-born women experience less disparate outcomes. Conclusions for Practice: Overall, women born in the United States are at higher risk of several adverse perinatal outcomes compared to foreign-born women. Racial and ethnic disparities in birth outcomes exist in both groups. However, the complex interplay between biopsychosocial influences that mediate these inequities appear to have different effects among U.S- and foreign-born women. A better understanding of these factors can be used to combat disparities and improve outcomes for all women.

Primiparous women in the 1st trimester of pregnancy were invited to participate in the cohort. General information on maternal socio-demographic characteristics and environmental exposure were collected using questionnaires. Pregnancy-specific anxiety was assessed by using pregnancy-specific anxiety questionnaire in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively. Delivery modes and pregnancy complications were abstracted from medical notes. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was adopted to examine the relationship between pregnancy-specific anxiety and elective cesarean section. Results indicated the overall elective cesarean section rate in this study was 45%. Among 1 874 pregnant women, 30.9% women experienced anxiety at least once during pregnancy, and 6.9% women suffered from anxiety in all three trimesters. Anxiety in the 2nd trimester was a significant predictor for elective cesarean section. Young maternal age and low educational level had indirect effects on women's choice of elective caesarean section through affecting pregnancy-specific anxiety. More attention should be paid to maternal psychological problems, and professional counseling needs to be strengthened to protect women from pregnancy-specific anxiety.

We aimed to investigate whether parental/perinatal adversities entail higher risks of stress-related disorders in the offspring, later in life, by accounting for genetic and early environmental factors. Based on the nationwide Swedish registers, we conducted a population-based cohort study of 3,435,747 singleton births (of which 2,554,235 were full siblings), born 1973-2008 and survived through the age of 5 years. Using both population- and sibling designs, we employed Cox regression to assess the association between parental and perinatal factors with subsequent risk of stress-related disorders. We identified 55,511 individuals diagnosed with stress-related disorders in the population analysis and 37,433 in the sibling analysis. In the population-based analysis we observed increased risks of stress-related disorders among offspring of maternal/paternal age <25, single mothers, parity >=4, mothers with BMI >= 25 or maternal smoking in early pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and offspring born moderately preterm (GA 32-36 weeks), or small-for-gestational-age. These associations were significantly attenuated toward null in the sibling analysis. Cesarean-section was weakly associated with offspring stress-related disorders in population [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.12] and sibling analyses (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.20). Our findings suggest that most of the observed associations between parental and perinatal factors and risk of stress-related disorders in the population analysis are driven by shared familial environment or genetics, and underscore the importance of family designs in epidemiological studies on the etiology of psychiatric disorders.

Methods: This 2016-2018 retrospective, population-based cohort study analyzed maternal delivery outcomes at 127 Illinois hospitals. International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 Revision codes were used to describe the incidence of SMM and route-specific complications. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the association of maternal sociodemographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics with the likelihood of coded complications. Results: Among 421,426 deliveries, the SMM rate was 1.4% overall, 0.4% for vaginal, and 2.8% for cesarean delivery. Other complications were documented for 6.9% of women with vaginal and 10.0% of women with cesarean deliveries. While SMM rates were stable, vaginal delivery complications increased 5.9% from 2016 to 2018 and cesarean delivery complications increased 13.8%. Patient age, minority race and ethnicity, high poverty level, and preexisting and pregnancy-related clinical conditions were significantly associated with each complication outcome. Higher hospital delivery volume was associated with higher route-specific complications. Conclusion: SMM significantly underestimates the incidence of maternal complications. Complicated deliveries have much higher charges and length of stay, although ICD-10 coding intensity may influence incidence. New outcome measures based on more detailed clinical data and linked antepartum and postpartum care will be necessary to improve obstetric quality of care measurement.

Aims and Objective: We hypothesized that there would be correlations between female patients becoming pregnant at a young age and practices such as harmful alcohol misuse, cigarette smoking, and drug use, the use of toxic substances, low educational attainment, and an essential absence of health care seeking about the outcome of adolescent pregnancies. Methods: We performed a prospective cross-sectional study of patients who gave birth between August and November 2017 at St. Pantelimon Emergency Hospital in Bucharest, Romania. Seventy-four patients aged 14 to 20 years, with a mean maternal age of 18.07 years, were enrolled in the study and answered a 15-item questionnaire about their social, educational, and medical background. Results: Fifty-three patients (71.6%) gave birth by caesarean section and 21 (28.3%) by vaginal delivery. Notably, patients aged 14 to 16 years had a lower rate of caesarean delivery compared with those aged 17 to 20 years. Moreover, 83.0% of the caesarean sections and 76.1% of the vaginal deliveries were at term. With reference to age and type of delivery, women are more likely to give birth by caesarean section at any age group (the association is not statistically significant at P < .05), except for the age of 15 years (five out of six patients in our sample had a spontaneous birth). Smoking was the most common risk behavior in the sample (45.9%, n = 34), followed by alcohol consumption (17.5%, n = 13) and drug use (5.40%, n = 4). Conclusions: A high percentage of caesarean delivery was reported, particularly in patients aged > 17 years. The percentage of female participants who underwent a caesarean delivery for their second pregnancy was significantly higher than compared with primipara participants. Patients receiving consistent antenatal care visits compared with those who did not monitor their pregnancy did not differ in the likelihood of undergoing a caesarean section.

Description: We conducted a retrospective analysis of self-reported antepartum factors and postpartum outcomes recorded in a quality improvement database among 430 women enrolled in a home-based maternal healthcare program between June 1, 2015 and August 1, 2017. Assessment: Over the study period, the rates of cesarean delivery (CD) increased (from 30 to 45%) and rates of vaginal delivery (VD) decreased (70-55%) while facility-based delivery attendance remained stable around 70%. Younger age (23.5 years for VD vs. 21.6 years for CD, p < 0.001), nulliparity (25.1% for VD vs. 45.0% for CD, p < 0.001), prolonged/obstructed labor (2.4% for VD vs. 55.6% for CD, p < 0.001), and fetal malpresentation (0% for VD vs. 16.3% CD, p < 0.001) significantly influenced mode of delivery in univariate analysis. The leading indications for CD were labor dysfunction (47.5%), malpresentation (14.5%), and prior cesarean delivery (19.8%). The CD rate among the subpopulation of term, nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies in vertex presentation also increased from 20% of all CD in 2015, to 38% in 2017. Conclusion: Among low-income women from rural Guatemala, the CD rate has increased above the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations in a period of 3 years. Additional research on the factors affecting this trend are essential to guide interventions that might improve the appropriateness of CD, and to determine if reducing or stabilizing rates is necessary.

Understanding how opioids influence CD trends is important in improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study aims to understand the association of opioid use with CD in the context of the demographic, clinical, behavioral, and health system complexity. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional analysis used representative data from the 2012-2014 National Inpatient Sample. Opioid use during pregnancy, CD, and other clinical variables were identified using ICD9 codes. Characteristics were assessed using bivariate and multivariate statistics. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association between opioid use and CD while controlling for confounders. Adjustments were made for rural/urban hospital location, regional median income, maternal age, race, and medical and pregnancy-related conditions. Results: The rate of CD in the overall sample was about 30%. Among opioids-users, the overall proportion of CD was significantly less (24.7%). The adjusted odds ratio for CD among opioids users was 0.74 (CI: 0.73-0.76, p < 0.001). This finding is unique to pregnant women who are covered by public insurance. In rural areas, the relationship between opioid use and CD was not significant. Conclusion: Opioid use during pregnancy is associated with lower CD rates in urban settings. This evidence suggests that maternal care varies between rural and urban areas in relation to CD of pregnant opioid users compared to non-opioid users.

In 2015, a convenient sample of 530 pregnant women in urban regions of Urmia, Iran, was recruited to complete a socio-ecological approach-based questionnaire. Then, 1 week after childbirth, the women were followed up by telephone to be asked about their MOD (response rate = 81.88%). Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of cesarean section (CS) among the women with university education, whose husbands were an employee in a governmental organization, who preferred a private hospital for delivery, and who selected the CS as the preferred MOD during pregnancy were significantly higher than their counterparts.

This study aims to examine the prevalence and factors associated with bottle feeding among children aged 0-23 months in Indonesia. Methods: Data from the 2017 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) of Indonesia were used with a cross-sectional study design. The research included last-born children aged 0-23 months using a sample of 6,763 mother-baby pairs. The independent variables included marital status, mother's education and occupation, wealth quintile, place of residence, type of delivery, sex of child, and child's age. The dependent variable in this study was using bottle feeding. Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression were used to examine the association between bottle feeding and related factors. Results: The prevalence of bottle feeding in Indonesia was 37.9%. Multivariate analysis showed that mothers with a higher education level (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 4.9, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.3-10.3), working mothers (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8), richest family (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.3), urban living (AOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8), caesarean delivery (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.8), female child (AOR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9) and children aged 6-23 (AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.6) were significantly associated with the use of bottle feeding relative to their counterparts. Conclusion: The increased risks of using bottle feeding have been significantly associated with maternal and child factors as well as the wealth index and urban residence. Continued support of discouragement of bottle feeding policy needs to be enhanced by considering significant variables in this study.

The secondary aims were to analyze the correlation between PP FOC and PTSS, and PP FOC and QoL, in women undergoing complicated childbirth. This cross-sectional study was conducted in South-East Sweden. Women aged >= 18 years who had undergone complicated childbirth (i.e., acute or emergency cesarean section, vacuum extraction, child in need of neonatal care, manual placenta removal, sphincter rupture, shoulder dystocia, or hemorrhage >= 1000 ml) were invited. Seventy-six women answered demographic questions and three validated instruments measuring PP FOC, PTSS, and QoL. The study population was divided into two sub groups: severe PP FOC or no severe PP FOC. Statistical analyses were conducted using Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and Spearman's rank-order correlation. Severe PP FOC was reported by 29% of the women, and 18% reported PTSS indicating post-traumatic stress disorder. Women with severe PP FOC reported significantly higher levels of PTSS, and significantly lower QoL in five dimensions: physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, and social functioning. There was a positive significant correlation between level of PP FOC and PTSS. There were also significant negative correlations between level of PP FOC and most of the QoL dimensions. In conclusion, almost one-third of the women with complicated childbirth reported severe PP FOC, and almost one-fifth reported PTSS indicating post-traumatic stress disorder. PP FOC correlated with PTSS and deteriorated QoL.

Objective: To describe characteristics and compare birth outcomes among women with and without cNMD. Methods: Data were from the Slone Birth Defects Study (case-control, conducted from 1976 to 2015), which collected information on demographic, reproductive, and lifestyle characteristics. cNMD included spina bifida, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, contractures, or arthrogryposis and were identified by participant report. Those with cNMD were matched to participants without cNMD by interview year and study site. We use modified Poisson regression to estimate relative risks (RR) for low birthweight, macrosomia, preterm birth, and small/large-for-gestational age (SGA/LGA). Given the case-control design and overrepresentation of infants with congenital anomalies, data were weighted to reflect a 3% national prevalence of infants with congenital anomalies. Results: Women with cNMD (n = 125) were more likely to be white, nulliparous, have a cesarean section, have an unplanned pregnancy, report a pre-pregnancy BMI >= 25 kg/m2, smoke during pregnancy, and report genitourinary infections. Women with cNMD had infants with shorter gestational length (mean difference: -7.44 days, 95% CI: -13.94, -0.95) compared to women without cNMD. cNMD was associated with higher risk of preterm birth (RR = 3.98, 95% CI: 1.33, 11.95) and SGA (RR = 2.14, 95% CI: 0.74, 6.15). Conclusion: Women with cNMD were more likely to deliver preterm and have an SGA infant. These findings highlight disparities faced by women with cNMD and stress the need to provide optimal perinatal and reproductive care.

Methods: Multichannel video-EEG was recorded for a median of 61.9min (IQR: 60.0-69.3). The absolute and relative scores of sleep states were calculated for each infant's recording. Parametric/non-parametric statistical tests and multiple linear regression analysis were used to investigate the influence of perinatal factors on SWC composition. Results: Eighty healthy term infants aged 1-36h were studied. A well-developed SWC was evident as early as within the first 6h after birth. The mean (SD) percentage of active sleep (AS) was 52.1% (12.9) and quiet sleep (QS) was 38.6% (12.5). AS was longer and QS shorter in infants delivered by elective caesarean section (CS) compared to infants delivered by vaginal delivery or emergency CS. Conclusions: This is the first large cohort EEG study that has quantified neonatal sleep. SWC is clearly present immediately after birth, it is dominated by AS, and is influenced by mode of delivery. Significance: This knowledge of the early neonatal EEG/SWC can be used as reference data for EEG studies of neurologically compromised infants.

Design: Retrospective analysis. Study sample: A total of 10,767 neonates divided into two groups according to delivery technique underwent NHSTs. Those who failed TEOAE or AABR were sent for diagnostic ABR examination. Results: A total of 5620 of 6044 (92.9%) of the neonates in the CS group passed the TEOAE test bilaterally and 424 (7.1%) failed either unilaterally or bilaterally. In the VB group, 4496 of 4723 (95.1%) neonates passed the TEOAE test bilaterally, while the remaining 227 (4.9%) failed the test either unilaterally or bilaterally. Bilateral passing rate of TEOAE test results was significantly higher in the VB group than the CS group (p < 0.05). The AABR failure rate (unilaterally or bilaterally) was 1% in the CS group, which was significantly higher than that in the VB group (0.6%). Diagnostic ABR bilateral pass rate was not statistically different between the groups. Conclusions: Delivery method was shown to affect the results of NHSTs.

Methods: Primiparous women (N = 527) were recruited to a longitudinal study about women's birth choices and experiences. At time 1, during pregnancy, women completed a questionnaire assessing prenatal depression, preferred birth plan, birth plan flexibility-rigidity and maternal expectations (i.e. Natural-Fulfillment, Infant-Reflects-Mothering, Sacrifice). At time 2, two-months post-partum, they reported their actual birth mode and answered a questionnaire assessing their PPD symptoms. Results: Natural-fulfillment maternal expectations were negatively related to PPD symptoms. Yet, the interaction of high natural-fulfillment expectations with an unfulfilled birth plan and the rigidity of the birth plan, served as a risk factor for PPD symptomatology. Conclusions: Understanding the conditions under which specific prenatal maternal expectations serve as a risk factor for PPD, can help healthcare providers identify women who are at high risk for developing PPD symptoms and plan preemptive interventions.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) and time of delivery (pre- and post-delivery) on the stress axes of the body, namely the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) and autonomic nervous system (ANS). Ninety-one pregnant women were volunteered to participate this prospective study. In these women, pre- and post-delivery HPA and ANS activities were measured noninvasively by salivary cortisol and heart rate variability (HRV), respectively. HRV was measured by 5-min electrocardiogram recording and time- and frequency-domain parameters were computed. Salivary cortisol concentration and HRV parameters were higher in women having vaginal delivery than those having cesarean delivery (p < 0.05). Cortisol levels did not differ between pre- and post-delivery (p > 0.05) but the time-domain parameters of HRV decreased post-delivery (p < 0.05). No interactions were observed between the types and times of delivery (p > 0.05). HPA and ANS axes had different activity patterns throughout the delivery process and they were higher during vaginal delivery, suggesting that they are integral parts of normal birth process and that cesarean delivery perturbs the activity of both axes.

Detecting risk factors for ASD could help initiate screening and risk prevention approaches. Herein, this study aimed to detect several maternal and neonatal risk factors for ASD in Egypt. Methods: In this case-control study, mothers of children with ASD who were visiting Beni-Suef University Hospital in Egypt (n = 268) were compared to mothers of children without ASD attending one primary school with a kindergarten (n = 504) regarding their preconception, conception, and postconception characteristics. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to investigate the possible associations between the collected data and the odds of ASD. Results: In the multivariable-adjusted models, urban residence: OR (95% CI) = 2.33 (1.60-3.38), relative father: 2.63 (1.74-3.96), history of diabetes: 5.98 (1.99-17.97), previous abortion: 2.47 (1.20-13.38), assisted fertility: 4.01 (1.20-13.38), family history of ASD: 7.24 (2.00- 26.24), multiple pregnancy: 11.60 (2.54-53.07), exposure to passive smoking during pregnancy: 2.95 (1.86-4.68), vaginal bleeding during pregnancy: 3.10 (1.44-6.67), hypertension with pregnancy: 3.64 (1.06-12.51), preterm labor: 2.64 (1.26-5.57), neonatal convulsions: 14.88 (5.01-44.20), and admission to neonatal intensive care unit 2.13: (1.21-3.74) were associated with the increased odds of ASD.

We aimed to determine the association between language preference and risk of primary cesarean delivery.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) deliveries of patients over 18 years old from 2011-2016 at an academic medical center, supplemented with data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. We used modified Poisson regression with robust error variance to calculate risk ratios for cesarean delivery between patients with English language preference and other language preference, with secondary outcomes of Apgar score, maternal readmission, blood transfusion, and NICU admission.ResultsOf the 11,298 patients included, 10.3% reported a preferred language other than English, including Mandarin and Cantonese (61.7%), Portuguese (9.7%), and Spanish (7.5%). The adjusted risk ratio for cesarean delivery among patients with a language preference other than English was 0.85 (95% CI 0.72-0.997; p = 0.046) compared to patients with English language preference. No significant differences in risk of secondary outcomes between English and other language preference were found.DiscussionAfter adjusting for confounders, this analysis demonstrates a decreased risk of cesarean delivery among women who do not have an English language preference at one institution. This disparity in cesarean delivery rates in an NTSV population warrants future research, raising the question of what clinical and social factors may be contributing to these lower cesarean delivery rates.

Background: Research shows that infants with involved fathers have better cognitive development, fewer crying episodes after caesarean birth, improved breastfeeding exclusivity and duration, and more regular sleep patterns. Preterm infants with involved fathers have improved cognitive development. Design: This cross-sectional exploratory study used survey methodology to explore factors associated with father involvement in the neonatal intensive care unit. Methods: The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used (see Appendix S2). Biological fathers of infants in a 97-bed neonatal intensive care unit in the southern USA completed a survey which asked about their involvement with their hospitalised infants and factors which affected that involvement. Eighty fathers completed the survey. Results: Age ranged between 20-53 with 43% first-time fathers. Compared to less involved fathers, fathers who were more involved were younger, married or living with the mother, performed kangaroo care or fathers of multiple gestation. Fathers who had attended the delivery were more likely to bathe their infants than those who had not attended the delivery and fathers who performed kangaroo care felt more confident than those who did not. Compared to fathers who visited less often, fathers who visited more often were younger, had infants with a shorter hospitalisation time and lower acuity, and had fewer children in the family. Conclusions: Fathers are involved with their neonatal intensive care unit infants in many ways. Factors were identified that affect involvement in the neonatal intensive care unit. Relevance to clinical practice: Results can help nurses in neonatal intensive care units worldwide facilitate father-infant interaction, identify fathers at risk for decreased involvement and advocate for institutional policy development for supporting neonatal intensive care unit father involvement.

This study aimed to identify the determinants of CFI.MethodsA birth cohort study (N = 641). Data on infant feeding was collected before 30 days, and at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and, at baseline, data regarding socioeconomic status, demographics, maternal and infant health, obstetric history, and infant care. The hypothesis was that the risk determinants for early CFI vary according to the type of food and the age range of this introduction. Twelve Cox regression models were fit with four outcomes (formula; other types of milk; other beverages; and solid/semi-solid foods) considering three different age ranges of the infant at their introduction (< 2 months, 2-4 months, and 4-6 months).ResultsThe introduction of the four food groups analyzed was early (median ages of introduction: formulas = 45 days; other milks = 135 days; other beverages = 120 days; solids and semi-solids = 135 days). The determinants that increased the risk of introducing formulas before 2 months were: primiparity, employed without maternity leave, mothers with unsatisfactory prenatal counseling and those who had cesarean sections. Not living with a partner, infant pacifier use at 2 months of age had a higher risk of introducing formula between 2 and 4 months of age. Non-white skin color, more than 35 years old, low maternal education, and lower family income increased the risk of introducing other types of milk between 2 and 4 months of age. Between 4 and 6 months of age, adolescent and low education level mothers had a higher risk of introducing other types of milk, unemployed was a protective factor against the introduction of other foods and beverages in this age group.ConclusionsThe determinants of early CFI varied according to the type of food and the age of introduction.

This cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 healthy pregnant women during their third trimester. A socio-demographic and obstetrics characteristics, the Hungarian version of WDEQ-A, Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form and Beck Anxiety Inventory were used. The analysis was performed using multivariate linear regression. Among four WDEQ-A subscales, Fear (19%) and Lack of positive emotion (13%) obtained the largest and smallest percentages of cases with severe FOB. The nulliparous obtained significantly higher mean score in subscales Isolation and Lack of positive emotion compared to the multiparous. Anxiety was the most common predictor for all subscales in both groups. In the nulliparous group, significant predictors included economic hardship for Moment of birth, being a housewife for Fear, and wanted pregnancy for Lack of positive emotion.

In this study we compared risk factors and prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in native Portuguese and migrants. Cross-sectional analysis was conducted using information collected at delivery from the participants of Generation XXI birth cohort. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the association between migrant status and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Prevalence of risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes varied between native Portuguese and migrants: teenage mothers (5.6 and 2.0%), primiparae (57.1 and 63.9%), smoking during pregnancy (23.0 and 19.1%), twins (3.2 and 8.0%), and caesarean section (35.2 and 45.7%). Among singleton births, prevalence of low birthweight, preterm birth and small for gestational age were 7.3 and 3.9%, 7.5 and 6.2%, and 15.1 and 7.6%, respectively for native Portuguese and migrants. The native Portuguese had an adjusted significantly higher risk of low birthweight (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.30, 5.48) and small for gestational age (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.26, 3.21), but a similar risk for preterm birth (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.81, 2, 34). Migrant mothers presented a lower risk of low birthweight and small for gestation and data suggest a healthy immigrant effect.

Participants: We conducted a longitudinal study of 570 Chinese immigrant and Canadian-born women in Toronto, Ontario. Methods: Any bed-sharing, defined as sharing a bed or mattress for any part of the night on any night in the previous week, and predominant bed-sharing, defined as sharing a bed or mattress for most of the night, on more than half the nights of the previous week, were evaluated at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum. Predictors of bed-sharing, evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models, were background (age, parity, education, household size, delivery mode, social support), cultural (immigrant status, acculturative stress, acculturation, postpartum ritual uptake), and postpartum variables (mental health, breastfeeding problems, fatigue, sleep knowledge, plans for bed-sharing, perceptions of infant sleep problems, cognitions about infant sleep). Results: One in five women (20.7%) reported bed-sharing as the predominant sleep location for their infant at 4 weeks postpartum, with nearly half (45.6%) reporting any bed-sharing at this time. The prevalence of any bed-sharing remained relatively stable at 12 weeks postpartum (46.5%), while predominant bed-sharing increased to 30.1%. The most consistent predictors of any and predominant bed-sharing at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum were lower education level, greater acculturative stress, and predelivery plans to bed-share. Conclusions: These findings have implications for the development of clinical recommendations given to expectant and new parents to promote infant sleep practices that are consistent with American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations.

The consequences are formidable, affecting lifetime health and economic prosperity. Among natural disasters, floods are the most common causes and tend to have the highest economic burden. The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with child resilience in the face of the natural disaster experienced by the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada during its unprecedented flood of 2013. Methods: The current study was conducted in a community-based cohort situated in the city of Calgary. The participants were recruited out of the All Our Families longitudinal cohort within the Cummings School of Medicine at the University of Calgary. Of the total 1711 people contacted, 469 people consented and completed questionnaire. Of those 469 who consented to be part of the study, 467 were eligible to be included for analysis. A flood impact questionnaire was delivered 6 months after the 2013 flood in families whose children were an average of 3 years old. Mother reported questionnaires were used to assess child resilience. The study included maternal data on a range of factors including socio-demographic, history of mental health, relationship with the partner and social support. Child related data were also incorporated into the study, and variables included delivery mode, child sex, and child age at the time of disaster. Results: Child resilience was best predicted by mother's age and social support, and by child gender, the child's externalizing and internalizing behaviors and the Rothbart temperament scale: effortful control. Furthermore, this study revealed that children who were more exposed to the flood events, showed higher resilience compared to the children who were less or not exposed. Conclusions: These findings highlight the risk and protective factors that predict child resilience and suggest that mother reported questionnaire are useful tools to assess child resilience amidst early life adversity.

Household pets may alter human gut microbiome composition. We examined if pet-keeping modified the association of CS with obesity at age 2 years in 639 Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study birth cohort participants. Pet-keeping was defined as having a dog or cat (indoors >=1 h/day) at child age 2 years. We used logistic regression to test for an interaction between CS and pet-keeping with obesity (BMI >= 95th percentile) at age 2 years, adjusted for maternal obesity.

Design and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 497 pregnant women between May and July 2020 using the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) to determine the effect of obstetrics history, fear of hospitalization, concerns about the pandemic, birth, and the health of both mother and infant, on antenatal depression during the COVID- 19 outbreak in Turkey. Findings: The general EDS mean score of the total group was determined as mean 13.70 +- 6.22, which was higher than the critical cutoff point of 13. According to the multiple linear regression model applied in the study, the best predictive variables for the mean EDS score were determined to be concerned about completing a healthy pregnancy (r = -0.45), social media and news programs related to COVID-19 increasing levels of concern (r = -0.31), fear of hospitalization as the birth approaches (r = -0.45), having bad dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic (r = -0.41), the request for an elective cesarean delivery because of fear of catching COVID-19 (r = -0.40), fear of breastfeeding the infant (r = -0.45), and concerns that their own health would be negatively affected because of the pandemic (r = - 0.39), and these variables affected the mean EDS score negatively (total variance 40.5%, R = 0.642).

It is expected that an increase in the density of midwives in the family physician program lead to a decrease in this indicator. This study aimed to compare the rates of caesarean section and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery before and after the implementation of the family physician program in health centres with and without an increase in midwives density. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, using multistage cluster sampling method a total of 668 mothers with two-month-old children were selected from among all mothers with two-month-old children who were living in rural areas of Kurdistan province. Using the difference-in-differences model and Matchit statistical model, the factors associated with caesarean section rates and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery were compared in centres with and without an increase in midwives density after the implementation of the family physician program. To compare the changes before and after the program, we used the data collected from the same number of women in 2005 as the baseline. Results: After adjusting for baseline data collected in 2005, the results showed no significant change in caesarean section rates and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery in the centres with and without an increase in midwives density after the implementation of the family physician program. The Matchit model showed a significant mean increase 14%(0.03-0.25) in women's awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth between 2005 and 2013 in health centres where the density of midwives increased compared with health centres where it did not. The difference-in-differences model showed that the odds ratio of women's preference for caesarean section decreased by 41% among participants who were aware of the benefits of natural childbirth, (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: (0.22-0.85); P > 0.001). Conclusions: The results of this study showed that an increase in the density of midwives in the family physician program led to an increase in women's awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth. An increase in women's awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth was associated with a decreased preference for caesarean section, however this reduction did not have a significant impact on caesarean section rates; possibly, this finding might be attributed to the complexity of this problem that needs a mixed strategy involving various stockholders.

Women with fear of childbirth often suffer from anxiety and/or depression, and treatment therefore also needs to target postnatal psychological well-being and the early mother-infant relationship. Methods: Three hundred and seventy-one nulliparous women out of 4575 scored >= 100 in prospective screening (Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire, W-DEQ-A), indicating severe fear of childbirth. These women were randomised to psychoeducative group intervention with relaxation (n = 131; six sessions during pregnancy, one postnatal) or to conventional care (n = 240) by community nurses (referral if necessary). Psycho-emotional and psychosocial evaluations [Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), social support, Maternal Adjustment and Attitudes (MAMA), Traumatic Events Scale (TES) and the Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ-B)] were completed twice during pregnancy and/or 3 months postpartum. Results: Postnatal maternal adjustment (MAMA mean score 38.1 +- 4.3 versus 35.7 +- 5.0, p = 0.001) and childbirth experience (mean W-DEQ-B sum score 63.0 +- 29 versus 73.7 +- 32, p = 0.008) were better in the intervention group compared with controls. In hierarchical regression, social support, participating in intervention, and less fearful childbirth experience predicted better maternal adjustment. The level of postnatal depressive symptoms was significantly lower in the intervention group (mean sum score 6.4 +- 5.4 versus 8.0 +- 5.9 p = 0.04). There were no differences in the frequency of post-traumatic stress symptoms between the groups. Conclusions: In nulliparous women with severe fear of childbirth, participation in a targeted psychoeducative group resulted in better maternal adjustment, a less fearful childbirth experience and fewer postnatal depressive symptoms, compared with conventional care.

Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of women who delivered singleton gestations > 24 weeks at our institution between August 2011 and June 2014. Based on a self-report at the time of admission for labor, women were stratified into four categories: those who attended a CBE class, those with a birth plan, both, and those with neither CBE or birth plan. The primary outcome was the mode of delivery. Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusting for clinical covariates were performed. Results: In this study, 14,630 deliveries met the inclusion criteria: 31.9 percent of the women attended CBE class, 12.0 percent had a birth plan, and 8.8 percent had both. Women who attended CBE or had a birth plan were older (p < 0.001), more likely to be nulliparous (p < 0.001), had a lower body mass index (p < 0.001), and were less likely to be African-American (p < 0.001).

Results: Women who were Black and who did not have a college degree or private insurance were less likely to report high shared decision making, as well as women who underwent labor induction, instrumental vaginal or cesarean delivery. Models with interaction terms showed that the reduction in odds of shared decision making associated with cesarean delivery was greater for Black women than for White women. Conclusions: Women in marginalized social groups were less likely to report shared decision making during birth and Black women who delivered by cesarean had particularly low odds of shared decision making.

Multiple factors have been studied aiming to explain these rates. Mode of delivery preferences among university students may provide insights into strategies to reduce those numbers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted enrolling students who attended Health Sciences and Human Sciences undergraduate programs in 2013. Participants answered a semi-structured questionnaire about which mode of delivery they considered the 'best' (less risky and more beneficial) and the 'preferred' mode (the one they would choose for themselves or their partners). Pearson chi-square was used to assess association among variables. Multiple regression analysis identified independent factors associated with the outcome measures. Results: Among the 797 students who provided complete responses (76% response rate), the mean age was 22.6 years, 61.6 percent were female, 2.6 percent had previous pregnancies, and 56.7 percent were born by cesarean. Vaginal birth was chosen as the 'best' mode of delivery by 91.2 percent, and the 'preferred' mode by 75.5 percent of students. Being male, born vaginally, and a Health Sciences student was associated with a preference for vaginal birth. Being a Health Sciences student and born vaginally was associated with considering vaginal birth the 'best' mode of delivery. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the recognition of the benefits of vaginal birth do not always translate into a personal preference for vaginal birth. The student's own mode of birth was a strong predictor of their preferences for mode of delivery.

The current study was undertaken to evaluate psychometric properties of Hindi version of the Turkish Scale for Measuring Maternal Satisfaction: Normal and Caesarean Births versions in order to fill this gap. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in selected public health facilities in Chhattisgarh, India. Healthy women (n = 1004) who gave birth to a single, live neonate, vaginally or via Caesarean section participated. Psychometric assessment was carried out in four steps: 1) scales translated from Turkish to Hindi; 2) Content Validity Index scores calculated for Hindi scales; 3) data collection; 4) statistical analyses for Hindi scales (Normal and Caesarean Birth). A 10-factor model with 36 items emerged for both scales. The Hindi- translated Normal Birth and Caesarean Birth scales had good internal reliability (Cronbach's a coefficients of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively). The Hindi Scales for Measuring Maternal Satisfaction (Normal and Caesarean Birth) are valid and reliable tools for utilization in Indian health facilities. Their multi-dimensional nature presents an opportunity for the care providers and health administrators to incorporate women's opinions in intervention to improve quality of childbirth services.

Cesarean section is a known factor able to increase maternal anxiety. Objective: To determine whether a new binaural beat-based technique can reduce the preoperative discomfort of the elective surgical patient. Methods: Prospective, randomized double-blind controlled study: 60 women scheduled to undergo elective cesarean section. Women with a low risk pregnancy were recruited and enrolled at the time of the '37 weeks' visit. Exclusion criteria were: psychiatric disorders, neurological impairment, epilepsy, deafness, use of drugs/alcohol during pregnancy, insufficient reading level. Participants will be contestually allocated to one of three groups according to a predetermined computer-generated random sequence: (1) 'binaural' group, (2) 'normal music' group, and (3) 'control' group. Participants of groups 1 and 2 will be unaware of the type of audio heard. Intervention: According to the allocation arm, participants were asked to listen an engineered audio track (binaural beat arm) created with the novel algorithm 'Dynamic Spectrum Phase Shift' (DMSPS), or an identical soundtrack without DMSPS in it (music arm), or no specific intervention, representing standard practice. The feeling of anxiety has been measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) questionnaire. Conclusions and Relevance: Binaural beat audio created with DMSPS algorithm provides superior changes in reported anxiety in comparison to normal music and above all to standard care. This technique does not need extra staff or extra staying time for the patients, so it could be a cost-effective way to manage preoperative anxiety in women undergoing elective cesarean section, with a potential impact to the mother's positive experiences and care of the newborn.

The aim of the present study was to assess perinatal outcome of mothers with anxiety disorder and to determine the association between maternal anxiety and long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations of the offspring. A hospital-based retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing pregnancy complications and long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations of offspring of mothers with anxiety disorder, during or before the pregnancy and mothers without anxiety. All singleton deliveries between the years 1991 and 2014 in a tertiary medical center were included. To evaluate perinatal outcome of women with anxiety disorders, generalized estimation equation (GEE) models were used to control for confounders. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative incidence of long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations, and a Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to control for confounders.

Using GEE models, controlling for maternal age, maternal anxiety was noted as an independent risk factor for preterm delivery (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.32-2.69; P < 0.001), hypertensive disorders (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.08-2.69; P = 0.02) and cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.32-2.1; P < 0.001). Offspring born to mothers with anxiety disorders had higher rates of neuropsychiatric-related hospitalizations (6.3 vs 3.1% P = 0.002; Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P < 0.001). Using a Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for confounders such as maternal age, hypertensive disorders, gestational age, birth weight, and cesarean delivery, being born to a mother with anxiety disorders was found to be an independent risk factor for long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations of the offspring (adjusted HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.58-3.89; P < 0.001). Pregnancy of women with anxiety disorders is independently associated with adverse perinatal outcome and higher risk for long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations of the offspring.

To date, the focus on studies about postpartum mental health after preterm birth has been on depression and on women. There is a paucity of research regarding prevalence, risks, and predictors of postpartum anxiety in parents after VLBW birth. Methods: Parents with VLBW infants and parents with term infants were recruited into the longitudinal HaFEn-study at the three largest centers of perinatal care in Hamburg, Germany. State anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and anxiety and adjustment disorders with a clinical interview one month postpartum. Psychiatric lifetime diagnoses, social support, trait anxiety, stress during birth, socioeconomic status, risks during pregnancy, and mode of delivery were also evaluated. To examine predictors of postpartum state anxiety in both parents simultaneously a multiple random coefficient model was used. Results: 230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. The risk for minor/major anxiety symptoms and adjustment disorders was higher in parents with VLBW infants compared to the term group. The risk for anxiety disorders was not higher in parents with VLBW infants. The most important predictors for postpartum state anxiety were high trait anxiety, the birth of a VLBW infant, high stress during birth, and low social support. Limitations: Data reported here are cross-sectional. Thus, temporal relationships cannot be established. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of early screening for postpartum anxiety in both parents with VLBW infants.

Therefore, the design of interventions that enhance higher levels of early motor skills may encourage subsequent participation in physical activity. To do so, it is necessary to determine the influence of certain factors (some of which appear very early) on early motor skills. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of some very early environmental variables (delivery mode, feeding type during the first 4 months of life) and some biological variables (sex and age in months) on preschool motor skills, considered both globally and specifically. The sample was composed by 43 preschool students aged 5-6 years. The participant's parents completed an adhoc questionnaire, reporting on delivery mode, feeding type, sex, and age in months. The children's motor skills were assessed using observational methodology in the school setting, while the children participated in their regular motor skills sessions. A Nomothetic/Punctual/Multidimensional observational design was used. Results revealed that certain preschool motor skills were specifically influenced by delivery mode, feeding type, sex, and age. Children born by vaginal delivery showed higher scores than children born via C-section in throwing (p = 0.000; d = 0.63); total control of objects (p = 0.004; d = 0.97); total gross motor skills (p = 0.005; d = 0.95); and total motor skills (p = 0.002; d = 1.04). Children who were exclusively breastfed outperformed those who were formula-fed in throwing (p = 0.016; d = 0.75); visual-motor integration (p = 0.005; d = 0.94); total control of objects (p = 0.002; d = 1.02); total gross motor skills (p = 0.023; d = 0.82); and total motor skills (p = 0.042; d = 0.74). Boys outperformed girls in throwing (p = 0.041; d = 0.74) and total control of objects (p = 0.024; d = 0.63); while the opposite occurred in static balance (p = 0.000; d = 1.2); visual-motor coordination (p = 0.020; d = 0.79); and total fine motor skills (p = 0.032; d = 0.72). Older children (aged 69-74 months) obtained higher scores than younger ones (aged 63-68 months) in dynamic balance (p = 0.030; d = 0.66); visual-motor integration (p = 0.034; d = 0.63); and total balance (p = 0.013; d = 0.75). Implications for early childhood care and education are discussed since this is a critical period for motor skill development and learning.

Quantitative data about pregnancy intentions and outcomes of TGE people are needed to identify patterns in pregnancy intentions and outcomes and to inform clinicians how best to provide gender-affirming and competent pregnancy care. Aims: We sought to collect data on pregnancy intentions and outcomes among TGE people assigned female or intersex at birth in the United States. Methods: Collaboratively with a study-specific community advisory team, we designed a customizable, online survey to measure sexual and reproductive health experiences among TGE people. Eligible participants included survey respondents who identified as a man or within the umbrella of transgender, nonbinary, or gender-expansive identities; were 18 years or older; able to complete an electronic survey in English; lived in the United States; and were assigned female or intersex at birth. Participants were recruited through The PRIDE Study--a national, online, longitudinal cohort study of sexual and gender minority people--and externally via online social media postings, TGE community e-mail distribution lists, in-person TGE community events, and academic and community conferences. We conducted descriptive analyses of pregnancy-related outcomes and report frequencies overall and by racial and ethnic identity, pregnancy intention, or testosterone use. Results: Out of 1,694 eligible TGE respondents who provided reproductive history data, 210 (12%) had been pregnant. Of these, 115 (55%) had one prior pregnancy, 47 (22%) had two prior pregnancies, and 48 (23%) had three or more prior pregnancies. Of the 433 pregnancies, 169 (39%) resulted in live birth, 142 (33%) miscarried, 92 (21%) ended in abortion, two (0.5%) ended in stillbirth, two (0.5%) had an ectopic pregnancy, and seven (2%) were still pregnant; nineteen pregnancies (4%) had an unknown outcome. Among live births, 39 (23%) were delivered via cesarean section. Across all pregnancies, 233 (54%) were unintended. Fifteen pregnancies occurred after initiation of testosterone, and four pregnancies occurred while taking testosterone. Among all participants, 186 (11%) wanted a future pregnancy, and 275 (16%) were unsure; 182 (11%) felt 'at risk' for an unintended pregnancy. Discussion: TGE people in the United States plan for pregnancy, experience pregnancy (intended and unintended) and all pregnancy outcomes, and are engaged in family building. Sexual and reproductive health clinicians and counselors should avoid assumptions about pregnancy capacity or intentions based on a patient's presumed or stated gender or engagement with gender-affirming hormone therapy.

Patients completed the questionnaire by Maurovich-Horvat et al. (J. Sleep Res., 2013, 22: 496-512). We personally interviewed 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy using the administered questionnaire regarding conception, pregnancy, delivery, perinatal and breastfeeding periods. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy reported 59 pregnancies versus 164 in the control group. In 16 cases (27.1%), a disease before pregnancy was present compared with eight cases (4.9%) in the control group (P < 0.001); among them, extrinsic asthma was reported 11 times in the narcolepsy with cataplexy group (P < 0.005). Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy more often had a single pregnancy compared with controls (P < 0.05). Gestational diabetes was more frequent in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (P < 0.05). Induced deliveries were higher in controls (P < 0.009). No differences were found between the groups in terms of duration of pregnancies and complications during and after delivery, as during the puerperium. Neonates from patients had heavier birth weight (P < 0.015). The breastfeeding period was longer in patients (P < 0.01). Modafinil and methylphenidate were the drugs administered in six pregnancies. No significant differences in depression during pregnancy and during puerperium were found between patients and controls. This is the first case-control study in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy related to pregnancy, delivery, childbirth and puerperium. Data suggest that patients have pregnancy outcomes similar to controls. The prevalence of gestational diabetes was higher in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy.

We examined Ontario's population of pregnant women on MMT and determined the impact of timing of MMT initiation on perinatal outcomes. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Ontario, Canada. Participants: Women eligible for public drug benefits and on MMT during pregnancy between 2005 and 2015. Measurements: We stratified women based on their timing of MMT initiation: (1) stabilized prior to conception, (2) newly initiated prior to conception, (3) initiation in trimester 1, (4) initiation in trimester 2 or (5) initiation in trimester 3. The primary outcomes in the multivariable logistic regression analysis were key perinatal health indicators: small for gestational age, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, severe maternal morbidity, caesarean section and induced labor. Secondary outcomes were specific to maternal opioid dependence: neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), NAS treatment, removal from mother's custody at hospital discharge and neonatal death. Findings: Among 1842 women on MMT during pregnancy, 87.6% (n = 1614) initiated MMT before conception. Almost a quarter of their infants (22.2%; n = 408) were born small for gestational age, 17.5% (n = 323) were preterm and 5.9% (n = 109) were born with a congenital anomaly. The odds of primary outcomes occurring did not differ based on timing of methadone initiation; however, infants of mothers who initiated methadone during pregnancy had up to a fourfold increase in the odds of social services removal at the hospital [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) range = 3.70-4.19] compared with those whose mothers were stabilized on MMT prior to conception. Conclusions: Later initiation of methadone maintenance therapy among pregnant women in Ontario, Canada has not been found to be clearly related to most key perinatal adverse health outcomes.

The potential psychological risks have not been acknowledged. This study aims to investigate emotional and behavioral problems in pre-school children born with elective CS (ECS) on maternal request prior to 39 weeks. Methods: Pregnant women within 12 gestational weeks between November 2008 and October 2010 were invited to participate in the China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS). They were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire respectively in 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy to collect basic maternal characteristics. Pregnant complications and delivery modes were abstracted from medical notes. Their singleton live births were followed up at preschool age. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) were completed by parents to assess children's emotional and behavioral problems. A total of 3319 mother-child pairs were put into the final analysis. Descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess the impact of delivery modes on abnormalities in SDQ dimensions at various gestational ages. Results: The prevalence of ECS on maternal request prior to 39 weeks, at 39-40 weeks, and after 41 weeks was 16.6, 23.7 and 15.9%, respectively. Compared with those born vaginally, children born with ECS on maternal request were more likely to have total difficult problems (RR 1.519, 95% confidence interval 1.077 to 2.142). ECS on maternal request was the independent predictor of emotional problems (3.479, 1.676 to 7.222) and total difficult problems (2.172, 1.175 to 4.016) in children born prior to 39 gestational weeks. Conclusion: Children delivered by ECS on maternal request have an increased risk to have emotional and behavioral problems prior to 39 gestational weeks at preschool age. The potential psychological implication prior to 39 weeks has been added to the roster of impacts of ECS on maternal request. Further research is needed to probe the potential biological mechanisms.

The aim of this study was to compare the level of sexual functioning among women with and without severe morbidity at six months postpartum and to identify the factors associated with sexual function scores of women. A prospective double-cohort study design was applied at two tertiary hospitals over a six-month period. Postpartum women with and without severe maternal morbidity were selected as the exposed and the non-exposed group, respectively. The study included 145 exposed and 187 non-exposed women. Those with severe maternal morbidity were significantly (P < 0.001) older (mean (SD): 31.6 years (6.26) vs. 29.2 years (5.65)) and had longer hospital stays (mean (SD): 5.9 days (3.79) vs. 3.6 days (2.23)). They were also more likely to have delivered preterm (75.9 vs. 93.0) and to have had a caesarean section (80.7 vs. 67.9) than those without severe maternal morbidity. After adjusting for age and mental health, there was no significant difference in Female Sexual Function Index scores (P = 0.895) between the two groups. Both groups showed the highest sexual dysfunction in pain and the lowest dysfunction in orgasm. Linear regression analyses showed no association between Female Sexual Function Index scores and sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive history, or quality of life. Sexual function in women with severe maternal morbidity did not differ from that in women without severe maternal morbidity. In-depth qualitative studies of women who have experienced potentially life-threatening conditions may improve the understanding of their sexual function.

Methods: Altogether, 1066 women with no previous mental health issues enrolled in the Kuopio Birth Cohort (KuBiCo, www.kubico.fi) were selected for this study. GDM was diagnosed according to the Finnish Current Care Guidelines. Depressive symptomatology was assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during the third trimester of pregnancy and eight weeks after delivery. Additionally, a subgroup of women (n = 505) also completed the EPDS during the first trimester of pregnancy. Results: The prevalence rates of GDM and PPDS in the whole study population were 14.1% and 10.3%, respectively. GDM was associated with an increased likelihood of belonging to the PPDS group (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.23-4.05; adjusted for maternal age at delivery, BMI in the first trimester, smoking before pregnancy, relationship status, nulliparity, delivery by caesarean section, gestational age at delivery, neonatal intensive care unit admission and third-trimester EPDS scores). A significant association between GDM and PPDS was found in the subgroup of women with available data on first-trimester depression (n = 505). Limitations: The participation rate of the KuBiCo study was relatively low (37%). Conclusions: Women with GDM may be at increased risk of PPDS. Future studies should investigate whether these women would benefit from a closer follow-up and possible supportive interventions during pregnancy and the postpartum period to avoid PPDS.

Methods A cross-sectional study investigated 395 post-delivery women able to breastfeed from 48 hours to 6 days for unpleasant breastfeeding, maternal stress during pregnancy and postnatal mental state. Social Readjustment Rating Scale evaluated prenatal maternal stress. Perceived Maternal Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale - Parent version, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale evaluated maternal mental state. Results Unpleasant breastfeeding experience showed to be positively related to the longer number of days the pain lasts; late onset of breastfeeding; less search for information about pregnancy and baby care (p < .01); lower catastrophizing behaviour towards infant's stress and C-section delivery (p < .04). Pain levels were positively correlated to longer periods of pain, later onset of antenatal consultations and depression (p < .05). Binary logistic regression pointed to the effects of lower self-efficacy and pain in breastfeeding, higher depression levels, gestational stress, labour adversities and success in breastfeeding. Conclusions The relationship among maternal perceived self-efficacy, anxious and depressive thoughts, catastrophizing behaviours, and unpleasant breastfeeding need to be evaluated to elucidate the best health professional intervention.

Strategies to ensure that national recommendations for sleep duration in infants are met require knowledge of perinatal factors that affect infant sleep. Objectives: To investigate the mechanistic pathways linking maternal education and infant sleep. Methods: An observational study was conducted on 619 infants whose mothers were enrolled at the Edmonton site of the CHILD birth cohort. Infant sleep duration at three months was assessed using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Maternal education was collected via maternal report. Prenatal and postnatal depression scores were obtained from the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Birth records and maternal report were the source of covariate measures. Mediation analysis (PROCESS v3.0) was used to examine the indirect effects of maternal education on infant sleep duration mediated through prenatal depression and birth mode. Measurements and main results: At three months of age, infants slept on average 14.1 h. Lower maternal education and prenatal depression were associated with significantly shorter infant sleep duration. Emergency cesarean section birth was associated with 1-hour shorter sleep duration at three months compared to vaginal birth [without intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis] (b: -0.99 h; 95% CI: -1.51, -0.48). Thirty percent of the effect of lower maternal education on infant total sleep duration was mediated sequentially through prenatal depression and birth mode (Total Indirect Effects: -0.12, 95% CI: -0.22, -0.03, p < 0.05).

Materials and Methods: Two hundred sixty-six patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery with a Pfannenstiel incision under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. All patients were screened for rs4680 and rs1799971 using a peripheral venous blood sample of DNA. Postoperative pain relief was provided by IV patient-controlled analgesia with sufentanyl and tramadol for 48 hours postoperatively. Postoperative pain scores and analgesic consumption were assessed, and CPSP was evaluated 3 months after surgery in all patients.Results:Twenty-nine patients (29/266; 10.9%) developed CPSP at 3 months after surgery. The risk factors for CPSP included previous cesarean delivery and higher analgesic consumptions at 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively (P = 0.032, 0.015, and 0.008, reapectively). No associations were found between CPSP and a single rs4680 and rs1799971 polymorphism, or their combinations (P > 0.05). In contrast, patients with rs1799971 GG required higher patient-controlled analgesics at 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively compared with those with other genotypes (GG > AG > AA). However, no significant effects of interactions between the 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms on analgesic consumption were observed. Discussion: Our results indicate that cathechol-O-methyl-transferase rs4860 and m-opioid receptor rs1799971 may not contribute to CPSP development after cesarean delivery. The genotype of rs1799971 affects postcesarean analgesic requirement, while the rs4680 do not. Additional larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional, bilingual web survey of 237 women who gave birth at two hospitals in New York City and assessed patient-reported experience and outcomes following the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the New York region. We ascertained SARS-CoV-2 status at delivery from the electronic medical record using participant-reported name and date of birth. We compared birth experience during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15, 2020-May 11, 2020) to a pre-pandemic response period (January 1, 2020-March 14, 2020). We estimated risk ratios for associations between birth experience and anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress, birth-related PTSD, emergency department visits, timely postpartum visit, and exclusive breastfeeding. Multivariable models adjusted for age, race-ethnicity, insurance, education, parity, BMI, previous experience of maltreatment/abuse and cesarean delivery. Results: Women who gave birth during the peak of the pandemic response, and those that were SARS-CoV-2 positive, Black, and Latina, had lower birth satisfaction and higher perceived health care discrimination. Women with lower birth satisfaction were more likely to report higher postpartum anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms, and lower exclusive breastfeeding. Experiencing one or more incident of health care discrimination was associated with higher levels of postpartum stress and birth-related PTSD.

Methods: It was an online cross-sectional survey conducted through the Survey Monkey(r) platform and after proper ethical approval a self-designed questionnaire was circulated by the snowballing sampling technique through the Whatsapp platform. Results: 1636 people respondent to the survey questionnaire. 63% of the participants mentioned that kissing could spread nCoV-SARS. Unprotected sexual intercourse with the spouse can cause infection spread, was reported by about one-third (35.9%). Nearly one-fifth (22%) thought that unprotected sexual intercourse with unknown partners/persons could not spread the infection. About half (49.7%) of the participants reported COVID-19 infection can be transmitted from mother to the child/fetus during the process of birth or during pregnancy and one-fifth (21.3%) of the participants reported going ahead with the Cesarean section if the mother is suspected of having or is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. About one-fifth feared for risk of birth defects and abortion in case the mother is infected with COVID-19. 28% of the participants reported COVID-19 infection can be transmitted to newborn by breastfeeding. Conclusions: The present study suggests that a significant proportion of people have misinformation about sexual intimacy, pregnancy, and breastfeeding in the ongoing pandemic which needs to be addressed.

Methods: A total of 9305 mothers selected by cluster random sampling were assessed cross-sectionally for chronic perinatal pain using a questionnaire by Junior Public Health Nurses (JPHNs). In addition, information regarding socio-demographic profile, obstetric history, infant details and perinatal depression were collected. Results: Of the 8302 (89.3%) valid responses, 552 (6.6%) mothers reported chronic perinatal pain. Among those with pain, 142 (25.6%) reported pain during pregnancy, 314 (56.7%) during postpartum and 96 (17.7%) during both periods. The commonest sites of pain reported were back 280 (51%) and pelvic region 110 (19%). Mothers with chronic perinatal pain were more likely to be younger, less educated, employed and from an urban background. Chronic perinatal pain was associated with obstetric complications, delivery by instrumental/caesarean section, non-exclusive breast feeding and higher maternal depression scores. Conclusion: Chronic pain is common among mothers in India during the perinatal period and greater attention needs to be given for it to be recognised and treated early.

Objective: Determine the prevalence of PTSD at postpartum weeks 4 and 6, and its relation with perinatal variables and quality of life Method: A cross-sectional study with 2990 Spanish puerperal women in Spain. Data were collected on socio-demographic and obstetric variables, and on newborns. An online ad hoc questionnaire was used, including the Perinatal Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Questionnaire (PPQ) and SF-36. The crude and adjusted odds ratios were estimated by binary logistic regression. Results: 10.6% (318) of the women appeared at risk for PTSD symptoms. Factors like having a respected birth plan (aOR: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.34, 0.80), using epidural analgesia (aOR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.44, 0.92) and performing skin-to-skin contact (aOR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.28, 0.50) were protective factors against PTSD, among others. Instrumental birth (aOR: 2.50; 95%CI: 1.70, 3.69) and caesarean section (aOR: 3.79; 95%CI: 2.43, 5.92) were found to be risk factors, among others. The area under the ROC curve in this model was 0.79 (95%CI: 0.76, 0.81). The women with PTSD presented a mean difference for QoL of -13.37 points less than those without PTSD (95%CI: -11.08, -15.65). Conclusions: The women with PTSD symptoms had a worse quality of life at postpartum weeks 4-6. Birth type, analgesia methods and humanising practices, like skin-to-skin contact and using respected birth plans, were related with presence of the postpartum PTSD risk.

The child and adolescent outpatient clinic in the hospital is for patients younger than 18 years. The objectives of this study were to explore the sociodemographic, pregnancy and birth characteristics, as well as the clinical profiles, of patients who presented to the child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic to statistically estimate the frequency of various psychiatric disorders among the attendees and to test hypotheses of the association of these psychiatric disorders with sociodemographic and birth and pregnancy characteristics as reported by many previous studies but with inconsistent results. Methods: A descriptive consecutive cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2017 to February 2018 in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic in Erbil province of Iraq's Kurdistan region. The diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) were implemented. Chi-square tests were used to test the hypothesized associations. Results: Of a total of 207 patients, 142 were males and 65 were females, and most lived in low socioeconomic status. Most of the patients' fathers were school educated, and most mothers were illiterate. Consanguinity was found in 41% of the parents, 26.6% of the patients were born by caesarean section(C/S), 62.8% were nurtured exclusively by breastfeeding in their first six months after birth, 42.5% of them visited faith healers before consulting a psychiatrist, 43% had neurodevelopmental disorders, 26.6% had intellectual disabilities with behavioral and emotional comorbidities and 30.4% had other mental/behavioral disorders. Conclusion: This study revealed that the child and adolescent psychiatric disorders in Erbil city are versatile and that many factors are significantly associated with them. Cultural concepts are still influential in the region in a way that can interfere with children's well-being, a situation that calls for more concern and attention.

To this end, the possible effect of third gestational, obstetric and neonatal variables, such as maternal age at delivery, fetal presentation, gestational age, newborn weight and Apgar at minute one, was controlled. The exposed cohort includes children born by cesarean section, and the unexposed cohort is composed of children born vaginally with or without induction. A total of 124 children were evaluated in their 1st year of primary school using the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire, Kaufman's Intelligence Test and the medical histories of the children collected after birth. By means of binary logistic regression analysis, it has been found that the type of delivery is presented as an independent risk factor for disorders in verbal, non-verbal and global development and for the general intellectual difficulties of children born of multiple births. These results suggest the need to analyze in future prospective studies with broader samples the relationship between different types of obstetric and perinatal variables of birth type and infant neuropsychological development and general intelligence, in order to prevent possible psychological alterations from birth.

This prospective panel study was conducted from August 2012 through April 2014 and included 222 native and 147 immigrant pregnant women in Taiwan. Caesarean rates did not differ significantly between native and immigrant women, including the overall caesarean rate (28.8%, 32.0%), medically indicated caesarean (22.5%, 24.5%), and caesarean without medical indications (6.3%, 7.5%). Results of multiple logistic regression models revealed that maternal complications and household activity support were positively associated with caesarean deliveries. Both native and immigrant women with high levels of informational support were less likely to receive caesareans. Immigrant women who were older than 35 years, had a middle level socioeconomic status, and perceived a high level of acceptance of caesarean in Taiwan were more likely to have caesarean deliveries. Informational support was a protective factor for caesarean delivery, whereas household activity support offered by the family was positively associated with caesarean delivery. Perceived acceptance level in mainstream society could affect immigrant women's use of caesarean delivery.

Design: Descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study. Setting: A maternity ward in a hospital located near Paris, France. Participants: A total of 256 women between the ages of 18 and 46 years were recruited while hospitalized in the maternity ward 1 to 6 days after childbirth. Methods: Participants completed a personal information form and five self-report scales: the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, and the Questionnaire Assessing the Childbirth Experience. We performed linear regression analyses and used scores on the Questionnaire Assessing the Childbirth Experience as the dependent variable. We considered prenatal, psychological, and obstetric factors as independent variables and adjusted results for covariates. Results: The prevalence of a negative childbirth experience was 23.3% among our participants. We identified primiparity, high anxiety trait scores, and an anxious attachment style as the prenatal variables that contributed significantly to negative perceptions of childbirth based on the first step of the regression analysis (R2 = .18; p < .001). We evaluated objective birth-related variables during the second step and found that mode of birth and use of epidural analgesia were significative predictors of the negative childbirth experience (R2 = 0.36; p < .001). The last set of variables included subjective birth-related factors, such as absence of the partner during birth and low perceived sense of control; these variables increased the explained variance from 36% to 69% (p < .001) and showed that these aspects were powerful predictors of a negative childbirth experience. Conclusions: Given that some prenatal factors influence women's perceptions of their birth experiences, preventive measures can be implemented by health professionals to support women with risk factors. In the early postpartum period, health care professionals should focus on subjective variables of childbirth because they strongly predict the overall childbirth experience for women.

As clinical indicators relied on maternal reporting, we aim to evaluate the quality of the self-reported data. Women were recruited across Jamaica during pregnancy or at delivery from July 1-30 September 2011. Indicators were compared between women recruited while pregnant and at delivery to understand possible differences between the sub-populations. Variables reported more than once between pregnancy and delivery were assessed to evaluate level of agreement (reliability). Clinical indicators from the literature were contrasted with study findings to determine how maternal reporting align with published prevalence (validity). Intra-class correlation and the kappa (k) statistic were used to assess reliability while chi-squared, Fisher's-exact or students-t were used to compare differences over time; p values <=0.05 were considered statistically significant. Women recruited during pregnancy (n = 3970) were younger, less parous and possibly more socially disadvantaged than those recruited at delivery (n = 5803). Socio-demographic and selected clinical indicators showed good to moderate (0.421 < k < 0.681) reporting consistency between pregnancy and delivery for previous C-section (k = 0.681), pre-existing diabetes mellitus (k = 0.616) and prior twin gestations (0.580). Most conditions however showed only fair agreement (0.21 < k < 0.40) including previous gestational hypertension (k = 0.387), asthma (k = 0.365), premature rupture of membranes (k = 0.324), eclampsia (k = 0.257) and essential hypertension (k = 0.213). Infectious conditions had poor reliability. Prevalence rates for most conditions, except sickle cell disease, were lower than the published literature. Complications and outcomes which were well defined for women were better reported than those requiring clinical judgment (e.g. prior C-section versus specific hypertensive disorders of pregnancy). NCDs with only episodic acute effects were not well reported, e.g. asthma, hypertension and sickle cell disease. Maternal reporting of pregnancy complications needs to be interpreted with caution.

We hypothesized that (i) maternal use of antibiotics in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and (ii) CS are independently associated with higher risk of childhood obesity in the offspring. Subjects/Methods: Of the 727 mothers enrolled in the Northern Manhattan Mothers and Children Study, we analyzed the 436 mother-child dyads followed until 7 years of age with complete data. We ascertained prenatal antibiotic use by a questionnaire administered late in the third trimester, and delivery mode by medical record. We derived age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z-scores using the CDC SAS Macro, and defined obesity as BMI z >= 95th percentile. We used binary regression with robust variance and linear regression models adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, pre-gravid BMI, maternal receipt of public assistance, birth weight, sex, breastfeeding in the first year and gestational antibiotics or delivery mode. Results: Compared with children not exposed to antibiotics during the second or third trimester, those exposed had 84% (33-154%) higher risk of obesity, after multivariable adjustment. Second or third trimester antibiotic exposure was also positively associated with BMI z-scores, waist circumference and % body fat (all P<0.05). Independent of prenatal antibiotic usage, CS was associated with 46% (8-98%) higher offspring risk of childhood obesity. Associations were similar for elective and non-elective CS. Conclusions: In our cohort, CS and exposure to antibiotics in the second or third trimester were associated with higher offspring risk of childhood obesity. Future studies that address the limitations of our study are warranted to determine if prenatal antibiotic use is associated with offspring obesity. Research is also needed to determine if alterations in neonatal gut microbiota underlie the observed associations.

We hypothesized that hospitalization for anorexia nervosa before or during pregnancy is associated with an elevated risk of adverse maternal and infant birth outcomes. Method: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 2,134,945 pregnancies in Quebec, Canada, from 1989 to 2016. The main exposure measure was anorexia nervosa requiring hospital treatment before or during pregnancy. Outcome measures included stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age birth, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, and other pregnancy disorders. We computed risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between anorexia nervosa and birth outcomes adjusted for maternal characteristics. Results: Compared with no hospitalization, anorexia nervosa hospitalization was associated with 1.99 times the risk of stillbirth (95% CI 1.20-3.30), 1.32 times the risk of preterm birth (95% CI 1.13-1.55), 1.69 times the risk of low birth weight (95% CI 1.44-1.99), and 1.52 times the risk of small-for-gestational age birth (95% CI 1.35-1.72). The associations with low birth weight and small-for-gestational age birth were more prominent in women hospitalized for anorexia nervosa during pregnancy or within 2 years of delivery. Hospitalization for anorexia nervosa was associated with certain maternal outcomes, including precipitate labor, acute liver failure, and admission to an intensive care unit. Discussion: Hospitalization for anorexia nervosa before or during pregnancy is associated with adverse infant and maternal outcomes. Infants are primarily at risk of stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational age birth.

Design: The study had a longitudinal design; it used anonymised data from a county council database on all women in Stockholm County, Sweden, who gave birth in 2013. Methods: Descriptive and inferential data analysis methods were used. Cox regression was applied to these variables: age when giving birth, diagnostic codes at birth, care encounters and types (e.g., visits or hospital admissions), day of discharge and care organisation and type. The data covered the period from childbirth through a 30-day period following discharge from hospital. Results: The database contained 28,963 births and 59,202 healthcare or medical care encounters. Of these encounters, 50.3% (n = 29,774) were planned visits to hospital postnatal care units within 7 days following discharge and 1.2% (n = 681) were admissions to hospitals. Of all women who gave birth, 12.2% (n = 3,533) visited the emergency room at least once. The number of visits peaked at day 6 following discharge. These factors significantly increased risk for emergency room visits: caesarean, assisted birth and sphincter injury. Conclusions: Emergency room visits occurred most commonly immediately following discharge when there were no routine check-ups. Greater risk of emergency room visits--following caesareans, assisted childbirths or sphincter injuries--indicated that early support for women with childbirth complications should be improved upon discharge from hospital. Other multiple risk factors for emergency room visits might exist. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Many emergency room visits could be prevented through early, more qualified, appropriate follow-up via maternity care systems and effective midwifery interventions. These initiatives could enhance care continuity and facilitate postpartum recovery.

Background: Use of their own mother's milk decreases preterm infants' mortality and morbidity, but expression is exhausting for the mothers. Mothers' and infants' characteristics are associated with milk output and exclusive breastfeeding at discharge, as well as later in infancy. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The data were collected through questionnaires in two neonatal units. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine whether mothers' and infants' characteristics are predictors of late expression initiation (>6 hr from birth), inadequate expression frequency (<=6 times per a day) and nonexclusive use of own mother's milk. Results: The sample consisted of 129 mothers. One-third of the mothers had adequate expression practices. Half of the infants exclusively received their mother's own breast milk. Previous neonatal intensive care unit experience, poor psychological well-being, an infant's male gender, caesarean section and high gestational birth age were significant predictors of late expression initiation. None of the studied variables were significant predictors of inadequate expression frequency. Furthermore, lack of previous expression experience, financial woes and high gestational age were predictors of nonexclusive use of own mother's milk. Conclusions: Expression practices, as well as use of own mother's milk, were suboptimal. High gestational age was associated with both late expression initiation and nonexclusive breast milk use. The mothers maintained expression regardless of their well-being. Relevance to clinical practice: Counselling and support are needed to avoid suboptimal expression practices. Special attention should be paid to mothers with moderately preterm infants, caesarean delivery, poor psychological well-being and financial woes.

Methods: This case-control study was conducted in pregnant females who delivered at KK Women's and Children's Hospital from November 2010 to October 2013 and had postpartum psychological assessment. Demographic, medical, and postpartum psychological status assessments, intrapartum data including method of induction of labor, mode of labor analgesia, duration of first and second stages of labor, mode of delivery, and pain intensity on hospital admission and after delivery were collected. PPD was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and clinical assessment by the psychiatrist. Results: There were 62 cases of PPD and 417 controls after childbirth within 4-8 weeks. The odds of PPD was significantly lower (33 of 329 [10.0%]) in females who received epidural analgesia for labor compared with those who chose nonepidural analgesia (29 of 150 [19.3%]) ([odds ratio] 0.47 (0.27-0.8), P = 0.0078). The multivariate analysis showed that absence of labor epidural analgesia, increasing age, family history of depression, history of depression, and previous history of PPD were independent risk factors for development of PPD. Conclusion: The absence of labor epidural analgesia remained as an independent risk factor for development of PPD when adjusted for psychiatric predictors of PPD such as history of depression or PPD and family history of depression.

Description: This longitudinal observational study involved the recruitment of 210 pregnant women who were prospectively followed until 3 months postpartum. Participants were recruited from antenatal clinics attached to four separate public secondary health facilities located in the suburban parts of Abuja. Cox regression hazards model was used to determine the risk of EBF cessation at 3 months postpartum. Assessment: Over 70.0 % of women had strong intention to exclusively breastfeed. The risk of exclusive breastfeeding cessation was significantly lower in women with strong exclusive breastfeeding intentions (HR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.8-0.95). Other risk factors for cessation of exclusive breastfeeding were pre-lacteal feed administration (HR 2.93 95 % CI 1.49-5.77) and mode of delivery (HR 0.17 95 % CI 0.04-0.67). Higher maternal age (>= 35 years), religion (Muslim) and having an unplanned pregnancy lowered the likelihood of having a strong intention to exclusively breastfeed an infant. Conclusions: Prenatal exclusive breastfeeding intention was a strong predictor of exclusive breastfeeding. Intentions to EBF were further explained by maternal characteristics. Effective promotion of exclusive breastfeeding during prenatal period should also target factors influencing breastfeeding intentions. Additional research is warranted into the influence of maternal attitudes and self-efficacy about breastfeeding on breastfeeding intentions and practice.

The present prebirth cohort study examined this issue in Japan. Methods: Study subjects were 1310 women. Information under study was obtained using a self-administered questionnaire. Postpartum depressive symptoms were defined as a total Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of nine or higher between three and four months postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for age, body mass index, gestational weeks at baseline, gestational weeks at delivery, number of children at baseline, previous miscarriage or stillbirth, previous abortion, history of depression, family history of depression, region of residence, employment status, educational level, household income, family structure, breastfeeding status, smoking during pregnancy, infant's birthweight, and infant's sex. Results: Postpartum depressive symptoms were identified in 8.2%. After adjustment for the confounding factors, compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean section was independently associated with an increased risk of postpartum depressive symptoms: the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-3.23). This positive association was more apparent among those who had no other children at baseline than among those who already had one or more children: the adjusted ORs were 2.94 (95% CI: 1.35-6.26) and 1.45 (95% CI: 0.68-2.92), respectively; however, this interaction was not significant. Limitations: Information on whether each cesarean section was emergency or elective and other obstetric complications was not available. Conclusions: Cesarean section may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum depressive symptoms, especially among women without children at baseline.

Methods: This case-control study included 100 matched pairs of postpartum women who had delivered at a large, integrated urban medical system in Bronx, New York, in 2012-2013, with the cases having had an emergency department visit within 42 days of delivery. The cases, identified utilizing administrative and billing data, were matched 1:1 with controls by labor unit, delivery mode and date, excluding nonviable pregnancies. The controls did not have a known postpartum emergency department visit. Variables were abstracted from administrative data and chart review, and included demographics, antenatal/intrapartum/postpartum complications and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Factors associated with puerperal emergency department use were identified via univariate and multivariable analyses. Results: Following conditional logistic regression, primiparity [54% vs. 32%, aOR 5.91, 95% CI 2.34-14.91], public insurance [70% vs. 56%, aOR 4.22, 95% CI 1.60-11.12], weekend delivery [30% vs. 26%, aOR 7.61, 95% CI 1.15-52.43] and delivery-related complications [47% vs. 28%, aOR 2.95, 95% CI 1.16-7.51] were associated with an increased risk of postpartum emergency department use, while women of younger ages (17-24 years old) were less likely to have postpartum emergency department use [aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.74]. Univariate analysis of individual events within the composite variables showed an association between gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and postpartum emergency department use [28% vs. 13% OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.26-5.39]. Psychiatric history, social instability, preterm delivery/neonatal intensive care unit admission, pre-existing medical/antepartum conditions and prolonged postpartum stay were not associated. Conclusions for Practice: Delivery-related complications, delivery timing, and certain sociodemographic factors are identifiable risk factors for increased postpartum emergency department utilization. These may be targeted for development of interventions improving puerperal care and potentially preventing emergency department visits, which are costly to the health system and disruptive to the lives of women and their families.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed to describe disrespect and abuse practices in obstetric care (interactions or conditions that are experienced as or intended to be humiliating or undignified) committed by healthcare providers. We included all pregnant women admitted for childbirth (vaginal and cesarean). Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with women, prior to discharge, regarding their experience at delivery. Results: 867 deliveries were observed. 18.8% of women (n = 163) experienced at least one disrespect and abuse event, especially at secondary care facilities. There were a total of 493 disrespect and abuse events, which, on average, represents three events per woman (39.4% were verbal abuse, 32% were physical abuse, and 28.6% were discrimination). In the majority of cases (> 50%), women did not give consent to not recommended invasive procedures and were not provided with adequate information to those procedures. Conclusions for Practice: Direct observation and interviews was a useful tool to identify disrespectful and abusive practices during delivery care. Our findings provide new evidence of the frequency and characteristics of disrespect and abuse during delivery care in Mexico, which can be used to inform maternal health programs. Additionally, these results encourage the creation of surveillance policies and committees in order to guarantee violence-free and dignified treatment of women during delivery care.

Methods: A total of 368 Chinese woman undergoing cesarean section were enrolled in this study. A cutoff of >= 10 for the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale identified postpartum depressive symptoms. Genotypes of SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT6 were determined using Sequenom MassArray single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. We analyzed the contribution of genetic factors (SNPs, linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype) to postpartum depressive symptoms and performed logistic regression analysis to identify all potential risk factors for postpartum depressive symptoms and define interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Results: The incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 18.7% in this cohort. Univariate analysis suggested that SIRT2 polymorphism at rs2873703 (TT genotype) and rs4801933 ((TT genotype) and SIRT6 polymorphism at rs350846 (CC genotype) and rs107251 (TT genotype) were significantly correlated with the occurrence of postpartum depressive symptoms (p < 0.05). Linkage disequilibrium was identified between SIRT6 polymorphisms rs350846 and rs107251. Incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms in cesarean-section parturients with SIRT2 haplotype CCC was decreased (OR 0.407, 95% CI 0.191-0.867; p = 0.016). SIRT2 polymorphisms rs2873703 and rs4801933 were multiply collinear. Logistic regression analysis showed that SIRT2 polymorphism at rs2873703 (TT genotype) and rs4801933 (TT genotype), domestic violence, stress during pregnancy, and depressive prenatal mood were risk factors for postpartum depressive symptoms (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Pregnant women with SIRT2 genotypes rs2873703 TT and rs4801933 TT and experiencing domestic violence, stress during pregnancy, and prenatal depression are more likely to suffer from postpartum depressive symptoms.

A longitudinal prospective design was used with 116 pregnant women during November 2014-December 2015 at a public hospital (Madrid, Spain) with three assessment stages: first trimester of pregnancy (personality factors), third trimester (childbirth expectations and coping strategies) and 48 hours after childbirth (labor satisfaction). The highest childbirth satisfaction scores were for professional support, support from partner and overall satisfaction. Higher childbirth satisfaction scores were found for vaginal births than for cesarean sections or instrumental births. Childbirth expectation dimensions showed the highest number of associations with childbirth satisfaction. Significant correlations were found between neuroticism and home assessment, agreeableness and environment, and openness to experience and overall satisfaction. Significant positive correlations were found between positive reappraisal and continuity, and negative correlations between avoidance coping and home assessment. Regression analyses showed the predictive role played by the type of birth, and the caregiving environment as childbirth expectation, and positive reappraisal and avoidance as coping strategies. These findings have important implications for health professionals who provide assistance to pregnant women through holistic models which include the assessment and adjustment of childbirth expectations.

However, maternal genetic factors could be confounding the association between early-life exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring, which makes inferring a causal relationship problematic. Objective: To test whether maternal polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for neurodevelopmental disorders were associated with early-life exposures previously linked to the disorders. Deign, Setting, And Participants: In this UK population-based cohort study, 7921 mothers with genotype data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)underwent testing for association of maternal PRS for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD PRS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD PRS), and schizophrenia (SCZ PRS) with 32 early-life exposures. ALSPAC data collection began September 6, 1990, and is ongoing. Data were analyzed for the current study from April 1 to September 1, 2018. Eposures: Maternal ADHD PRS, ASD PRS, and SCZ PRS were calculated using discovery effect size estimates from the largest available genome-wide association study and a significance threshold of P < .05. Main Outcomes And Meaure: Outcomes measured included questionnaire data on maternal lifestyle and behavior (eg, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and maternal age), maternal use of nutritional supplements and medications in pregnancy (eg. acetaminophen, iron, zinc, folic acid, and vitamins), maternal illnesses (eg, diabetes, hypertension, rheumatism, psoriasis, and depression), and perinatal factors (eg, birth weight, preterm birth, and cesarean delivery). Results: Maternal PRSs were available from 7921 mothers (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [4.8] years). The ADHD PRS was associated with multiple prenatal factors, including infections (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18), use of acetaminophen during late pregnancy (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18), lower blood levels of mercury (b coefficient, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.02), and higher blood levels of cadmium (b coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.09). Little evidence of associations between ASD PRS or SCZ PRS and prenatal factors or of association between any of the PRSs and adverse birth events was found. Sensitivity analyses revealed consistent results. Conclusions And Relevance: These findings suggest that maternal risk alleles for neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily ADHD, are associated with some pregnancy-related exposures. These findings highlight the need to carefully account for potential genetic confounding and triangulate evidence from different approaches when assessing the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.

Prior research has indicated elevated risk of cesarean delivery among women with certain disabilities, but has not examined patterns across multiple types of disability or by parity. Objective: This study sought to determine whether physical, sensory, or intellectual and developmental disabilities are independently associated with primary cesarean delivery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all deliveries in California from 2000 to 2010 using linked birth certificate and hospital discharge data. We identified physical, sensory, and intellectual and developmental disabilities using International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification codes. We used logistic regression to examine the association of these disabilities and primary cesarean delivery, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, and stratified by parity. Results: In our sample, 0.45% of deliveries (20,894/4,610,955) were to women with disabilities. A greater proportion of women with disabilities were nulliparous, had public insurance, and had comorbidities (e.g., gestational diabetes) compared with women without disabilities (p < .001 for all). The proportion of primary cesarean in women with disabilities was twice that in women without disabilities (32.7% vs. 16.3%; p < .001; adjusted odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-2.17). The proportion of deliveries by cesarean was highest among women with physical disabilities due to injuries compared with women without disabilities (57.8% vs. 16.3%; p < .001; adjusted odds ratio, 6.83; 95% confidence interval, 5.46-8.53). Conclusions: Women across disability subgroups have higher odds of cesarean delivery, and there is heterogeneity by disability type. More attention is needed to this population to ensure better understanding of care practices that may impact maternal and perinatal outcomes.

A prospective study was conducted. Participants were recruited antenatally from a public and a private maternity hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Nulliparous pregnant women (N = 229), >= 18 years of age, >= 36-week gestation, singleton pregnancy and with sufficient English were eligible. Data were collected by self-report questionnaire (pregnancy, weeks 1-4 postpartum) and telephone interview (week 8 postpartum). A high burden of physical problems was classified as >= 3 problems (caesarean/perineal pain; back pain; constipation; haemorrhoids; urinary and bowel incontinence) for >= 2 time points. A high burden of breastfeeding problems was having >= 2 problems (mastitis; nipple pain; frequent expressing; over- or under-supply of milk) for >= 2 time points. Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between maternal mood, assessed using Profile of Mood States (8-week postpartum), and a high burden of breastfeeding and/or physical health problems. Forty-six women (20.1%) had a high burden of physical symptoms, 44 (19.2%) a high burden of breastfeeding problems only and 25 women (11.0%) had both. A high burden of breastfeeding problems alone (b = 10.6, p = 0.01) or with co-morbid physical problems (b = 15.35, p = 0.002) was significantly associated with poorer maternal mood at 8 weeks.

We evaluated associations between provider type and mode of birth, including examination of intrapartum management in healthy, laboring nulliparous women. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected perinatal data from a United States academic medical center (2005-2012). The sample included healthy nulliparous women with spontaneous labor onset and term, singleton, vertex fetus managed by either obstetricians or certified nurse-midwives. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to compare labor interventions and mode of birth by provider type. Results: A total of 1339 women received care by an obstetrician (n = 749) or nurse-midwife (n = 590). The cesarean rate was 13.4% (179/1339). Adjusting for maternal and pregnancy characteristics, care by obstetricians was associated with an increased risk of unplanned cesarean birth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.48 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.04-2.12]) compared with care by midwives. Obstetricians more frequently used oxytocin augmentation (aOR 1.41 [95% CI 1.10-1.80]), neuraxial anesthesia (aOR 1.69 [95% CI 1.29-2.23]), and operative vaginal delivery with forceps or vacuum (aOR 2.79 [95% CI 1.75-4.44]). Adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes were not different by provider type across all modes of birth, but were more frequent in women with cesarean than vaginal births. Discussion: In low-risk nulliparous laboring women, care by obstetricians compared with nurse-midwives was associated with increased risk of labor interventions and operative birth. Changes in labor management or increased use of nurse-midwives could decrease the rate of a first cesarean in low-risk laboring women.

Methods: A multicenter prospective study of mothers who gave birth to live singleton infants in Japan was conducted. Following ethics approval, the participants completed questionnaires 1 day before discharge and 1 month after childbirth. The questionnaires included the Postpartum Maternal Confidence Scale, demographics and background information, prenatal and obstetric data, situational variables and perceptions of daily life, and social support. The obstetric data were extracted from the hospital medical records. Data from the older primiparae (n = 479) and the younger primiparae (n = 1033) were analyzed by using multiple stepwise regressions, controlling for the delivery mode. Results: Maternal confidence at 1 month post-partum was positively associated with emotional support for the older primiparae and appraisal support and exclusive breastfeeding for younger primiparae. In both groups, feeling overwhelmed by daily life, a lack of communication with their partner about the parenting role, and a lack of prior experience in caring for babies were negatively related to maternal confidence. Family budget instability was negatively related to maternal confidence in the younger group. Conclusion: Providing care that is based on an understanding of the unique support needs of first-time mothers in different age groups could promote more effective parenting.

Pain reported upon intravenous cannulation was shown to predict epidural analgesic use and pain intensity during labour. We hypothesized that pain intensity reported by women upon local anaesthesia injection (ILA) for spinal anaesthesia may predict acute pain after caesarean delivery (CD). Methods: In a prospective observational trial, 229 women undergoing elective CD under spinal anaesthesia were enrolled. Using standardized script before ILA, women received ILA (lidocaine 1% 2.5 mL via 25 G needle), and provided an ILA score after the injection [verbal numeric pain scale (VNPS); 0-100]. Demographic data, average, peak pain (at rest, with movement and uterine cramping) and analgesic requests were recorded for the first 24 h. Results: Fourteen percent of women experienced severe pain (VNPS >= 70) upon ILA. Good correlation was noted between ILA and pain scores at rest and upon mobilization during the 24 h following surgery (average resting pain r = 0.529, p < 0.001, average pain at mobilization r = 0.483, p < 0.0001). Severe acute postoperative pain (VNPS >=70) was predicted by severe ILA pain with a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 93.3%. Conclusion: This is the first study evaluating a clinical measure to predict post-caesarean pain.

Rarely, some women may have their first seizure during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features and pregnancy outcomes in women with new-onset epilepsy during pregnancy. Methods: 112 pregnant women with epilepsy were prospectively evaluated at the Education--Therapeutic Clinic of the Azerbaijan Medical University, in the neurological and maternity departments of the Clinical Medical Center in Baku over a six-year period. Women were regularly followed by a neurologist and obstetrician till the end of pregnancy. To determine the recurrence of seizures during the pregnancy and after delivery, the women were followed up at least once per three months for a one year period after delivery. Delivery and perinatal outcomes were compared with those of 277 healthy women in the control group (without epilepsy and without registering chronic diseases). Results: Of the 112 pregnant women with epilepsy, 12 (10.7%) had their first seizures during the pregnancy: 6 in the 1st, 4 in the 2nd, 2 in the 3rd trimester. Women with new-onset epilepsy had increased risk of cesarean section and perinatal hypoxia in offspring, compared with controls (Odds ratio [OR]: 13.57; 95% confidence interval (CI):2.86-64.31 and OR: 3.61; 95 % CI: 1.06-12.27, respectively).

Objective: Examine the determinants associated with women's use of labour pain management. Design: Cross-sectional survey of a substudy of women from the 'young' cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health (ALSWH). Setting and participants: Women aged 31-35 years who identified as being pregnant or recently given birth in the 2009 ALSWH survey (n = 2445) were recruited for the substudy. The substudy survey was completed by 1835 women (RR = 79.2%). Main variables studied: Determinants examined included pregnancy health and maternity care [including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)] for their most recent pregnancy and any previous pregnancies. Participants' attitudes and beliefs related to both CAM and maternity care were also included in the analysis. Main outcome measures: The outcome measures examined were the use of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management techniques (NPMT). Results: Differences were seen in the effects of demographics, health service utilization, health status, use of CAM, and attitudes and beliefs upon use of intrapartum pain management techniques across all categories. The only variable that was identified as a determinant for use of all types of pain management techniques was a previous caesarean section (CS). Discussion and conclusions: The effect of key determinants on women's use of pain management techniques differs significantly, and, other than CS, no one determinant is clearly influential in the use of all pain management options.

perinataloutcomesofwomendiagnosedwithattention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder:anaustralianpopulation-basedcohortstudy;2018;poulton,perinatal outcomes of women diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: an australian population-based cohort study,2018.0,"Poulton, Alison, S.;Armstrong, Bruce;Nanan, Ralph, K.","Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common and may require treatment in adulthood. We aimed to investigate the treatment patterns and perinatal outcomes of women with any history of stimulant treatment for ADHD. Methods: We used health records of the New South Wales (NSW, Australia) population to compare perinatal outcomes of women treated with stimulants (dexamphetamine or methylphenidate) for ADHD from 1982 to 2012 who gave birth between 1994 and 2012, with perinatal outcomes of women with no known ADHD or stimulant treatment (comparison cohort). Five comparison women, matched by maternal age and infant year of birth, were selected for each treated woman. Pregnancy outcome odds ratios in the two groups were adjusted for confounders including maternal age and smoking. Results: Of 5056 women treated for ADHD with stimulant medication, 3351 (66.3%) had stimulant treatment documented before the index pregnancy but not within 1 year before the expected date of delivery, 175 (3.5%) had stimulant treatment before and possibly during pregnancy (stimulant prescription within the 12 months directly before the expected date of the index birth and earlier), and 1530 (30.2%) had no stimulant treatment until after the index pregnancy. Treatment for ADHD at any time (before, before and during and only after the index pregnancy) was associated with reduced likelihood of spontaneous labour--odds ratios (ORs) 0.7 [0.7, 0.8], 0.7 [0.5, 0.9], and 0.7 [0.7, 0.8], respectively--and increased risk of caesarean delivery (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 1.3 [0.9, 1.8], 1.3 [1.1, 1.4]); active neonatal resuscitation (1.2 [1.0, 1.3], 1.7 [1.1, 2.7], 1.3 [1.0, 1.7]); and neonatal admission > 4 h (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 1.7 [1.2, 2.4], 1.2 [1.0, 1.4]). Treatment before or before and during pregnancy was, in addition, associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia (1.2 [1.0, 1.4], 1.5 [0.8, 2.6]); preterm birth < 37 weeks (1.2 [1.0, 1.3], 1.4 [0.9, 2.3]); and 1-min Apgar < 7 (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 2.0 [1.4, 2.9]). Stimulant prescribing was low during pregnancy (3.5% of women received such a prescription) and dropped during the 12 months before the due date from an average of 24.7 prescriptions per month in the first 6 months to 4.5 per month in the final 6 months. Conclusions: Compared with no treatment, ADHD stimulant treatment at any time was associated with small increases in the risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes; treatment before, or before and during pregnancy, was associated with additional adverse outcomes, even after a treatment-free period of several years. None of these associations can be confidently attributed to stimulant treatment; in all cases ADHD per se or correlates of it could be responsible for the association.

This study aimed to identify trajectories of birth-related PTSD; determine factors associated with each trajectory; and identify women more likely to develop birth-related PTSD. Method: 226 women who had traumatic childbirth according to DSM-IV criterion A were drawn from a community sample of 950 women. Measures were taken of PTSD, affective symptoms, fear of childbirth and social support in pregnancy, 4-6 weeks and 6-months postpartum. Information on some obstetric and psychosocial factors were also prospectively obtained. Results: Four trajectories were identified: resilience (61.9%), recovery (18.5%), chronic-PTSD (13.7%) and delayed-PTSD (5.8%). Resilience was consistently distinguished from other PTSD trajectories by less affective symptoms at 4-6 weeks postpartum. Poor satisfaction with health professionals was associated with chronic-PTSD and delayed-PTSD. When affective symptoms at 4-6 weeks postpartum were removed from the model, less social support and higher fear of childbirth 4-6 weeks after birth predicted chronic and recovery trajectories; whereas experience of further trauma and low levels of satisfaction with health professionals were predictive of chronic-PTSD and delayed-PTSD, compared to resilience. Additional variables associated with different trajectories included antenatal affective symptoms, caesarean-section, preterm birth and receiving professional help. Limitations: Use of self-report measures, use of DSM-IV criteria for PTSD diagnosis, and no follow-up beyond six months are the main limitations of this study. Conclusion: Identified factors may inform preventive and treatment interventions for women with traumatic birth experiences.

Setting and subjects: In 2011, a total of 657 women participated in phase III of the Childbirth and Health Cohort Study in Icelandic Primary Health Care, 18 to 24 months after delivery. The women had previously participated in phase I around pregnancy week 16 and phase II 5-6 months after delivery. Data were collected by postal questionnaires. Main outcome measures: Women's reported history of experienced violence, sociodemographic and obstetric background, self-perceived health, the use of medications and their child's perceived health. Results: In phase III, 16% of women reported experiencing violence. These women felt less support from their current partner (p < 0.001), compared to those who did not report violence. Their pregnancies were more frequently unplanned (p < 0.001), deliveries more often by caesarean section (p < 0.05), and their self-perceived health was worse (p < 0.001). They reported more mental and somatic health complaints, and their use of antidepressant drugs was higher (p < 0.001). Furthermore, women with a history of violence considered their child's general health as worse (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Our study confirms that a history of violence is common among women. A history of violence is associated with various maternal health problems during and after pregnancy, a higher rate of caesarean sections and maternal reports of health problems in their child 18-24 months after birth.

The aim of this study was to compare birth experiences a year after childbirth in two groups of women receiving treatment for experiencing fear of birth during pregnancy. Methods: As part of the U-CARE: Pregnancy Trial, a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) and standard care among pregnant women with fear of birth. Women were recruited at three Swedish hospitals following a screening procedure that assessed their fear of birth. Data were collected online with the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), one question about the overall birth experience, and questions about personal background, collected before randomization. Results: A total of 181 women responded to the follow-up questionnaire a year after childbirth. Approximately half of participants reported a less positive birth experience. Preferred mode of birth, actual mode of birth, marital status and psychiatric history were associated with the domains of the CEQ. However, no statistically significant differences emerged between the treatment groups. Conclusions: Being randomized to receive iCBT or counseling with midwives for fear of birth was not associated with perceptions of the birth experience assessed a year after birth. Most participants reported less-than-positive birth experiences and scored low on the domain of the CEQ reflecting Own capacity. In response, additional research remains necessary to identify the best model of care that might facilitate positive experiences with giving birth among women with fear of birth.

Aims: To investigate the impact of gestational age at birth and SGA, birth on child attention problems. Study design: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. Subjects: A total of 1435 children sampled from the Bavarian Longitudinal Study (BLS). Outcome measures: Main outcome variables were parent-reported attention problems and examiner-reported attention skills at 6 and 8years. Predictors were linked to attention outcomes using hierarchical regression analyses. Results: Gestational age at birth ranged from 25weeks to 41weeks. We found a quadratic effect of gestational age on attention problems (b 6 years = 0.161, 95% CI = 0.085; 0.236; b 8 years = 0.211, 95% CI = 0.135; 0.287), and attention skills at 6 and 8years (b 6 years = -0.178, 95% CI = -0.252; -0.104; b 8 years = -0.169, 95% CI = -0.243; -0.094). Elective caesarean birth did not predict child attention. In adjusted models, SGA was an additional risk factor for attention problems (b = 0.080, 95% CI = 0.026; 0.134), and attention skills (b = -0.091, 95% CI = -0.143; -0.039) at 6years but not at 8years after adjusting for child sex and family SES. Conclusion: Adverse effects on attention are disproportionately higher at early gestations. In contrast, the impact of SGA status was found to be similar at all gestational ages but disappeared by 8years.

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Settings: Fifty two sites of mandated public neonatal health checkup in 6 urban cities in West Japan. Participants: Mothers who attended neonatal health checkups for their babies in 2011 (n = 1316, response rate = 27.4%). Main Outcome Measure: Willingness to pay (WTP) for physician-attended care compared with midwife care as the process-related value of care safety. WTP was estimated using conjoint analysis based on the participants' choice over possible alternatives that were randomly assigned from among eight scenarios considering attributes such as professional attendance, amenities, painless delivery, caesarean section rate, travel time and price. Results: The WTP for physician-attended care over midwife care was estimated 1283 USD. Women who had experienced complications in prior deliveries had a 1.5 times larger WTP. Conclusions: We empirically evaluated the process value for safety practice in perinatal care that was larger than a previously reported accounting-based value. Our results indicate that measurement of process value from the patient's view is informative for the evaluation of safety care, and that it is sensitive to individual risk perception for the care process.

This article outlines the design and development of the app to include funding, ethics, and the recruitment of an app developer, as well as the evaluation of using the app by seven participants. Organizing Construct: Data collection methods used in qualitative research include interviews and focus groups (either online, face-to-face, or by phone), participant diaries, or observations of interactions. This article identifies an alternative data collection methodology using a smartphone app to collect real-time data. Conclusions: The app provides real-time data and instant access to data alongside the ability to access participants from a variety of locations. This allows the researcher to gain insight into the experiences of participants through audio or video recordings in longitudinal studies without the need for constant interactions or interviews with participants. Clinical Relevance: Using smartphone applications can allow researchers to access participants who are traditionally hard to reach and access their data in real time.

Given the possible trajectories of posttraumatic reactions, we hypothesized that prevalences of postpartum posttraumatic reactions at given times underestimate the real amount of mothers experiencing these symptoms within 18 months following delivery. Additionally, we examined whether sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of dyads influence the expression of posttraumatic symptoms among these mothers. A sample of 100 dyads was included in this longitudinal study led by 3 french university hospitals. Preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation and their mothers were followed-up over 18 months and attended 5 visits assessing the infants' health conditions and the mothers' psychological state with validated scales. Fifty dyads were retained through the 18 months of the study. The period prevalence of posttraumatic reactions was calculated and a group comparison was conducted to determine their predictive factors. Thirty-six percent of the mothers currently suffered from posttraumatic symptoms 18 months after their preterm delivery. The 18 months period prevalence was 60.4% among all the mothers who participated until the end of the follow-up. There was a statistical link between posttraumatic symptoms and a shorter gestational age at delivery, C-section, and the mother's psychological state of mind at every assessment time. Only a small proportion of mothers were receiving psychological support at 18 months. Preterm mothers are a population at risk of developing a long-lasting postpartum posttraumatic disorder, therefore immediate and delayed systematic screenings for posttraumatic symptoms are strongly recommended to guide at-risk mothers towards appropriate psychological support.

A conditional logistic regression model was used to examine the association of clinical variables and autism spectrum disorder. Significantly elevated odds ratios for autism spectrum disorder were associated with first-time Cesarean section (odds ratio = 2.56), but not a repeat Cesarean section. Odds ratios were also significantly elevated for subjects whose mother's body mass index was 35 or higher at birth (odds ratio = 2.34) and subjects in which the reason for delivery was categorized as 'fetal indication' (odds ratio = 2.00). When controlling for these and other variables, the odds of developing autism spectrum disorder were significantly elevated in males with long duration of exposure (odds ratio = 3.48) and high cumulative dose of synthetic oxytocin (odds ratio = 2.79). No significant associations of synthetic oxytocin dosing and autism spectrum disorder were noted in female subjects. The association of elevated autism spectrum disorder odds found with high duration and high cumulative dose synthetic oxytocin in male subjects suggests the need for further investigation to fully elucidate any cause and effect relationship. Lay abstract: Oxytocin is a hormone naturally produced in the human body that can make the womb (uterus) contract during labor. Manufactured oxytocin is frequently given to mothers in labor to strengthen the contractions or in some cases to start labor. This study compared children with a diagnosis of autism and children without autism to see whether children with autism received more oxytocin during labor. The odds of a child having an autism diagnosis were significantly higher if the delivery was a first-time Cesarean section, if the mother had a body mass index of 35 or higher, or if the reason for delivery were a range of fetal problems that made delivery necessary. It was found that boys who were exposed to oxytocin for longer periods of time during labor and received higher total doses of oxytocin had significantly higher odds of developing autism. There were no significant associations of oxytocin dosing and autism noted in female children. As this is the first study to look at any relationship between the dose of oxytocin received during labor and the odds of developing autism, further study needs to be done to determine whether there is any cause and effect relationship. Thus, at this time, there is no recommended change in clinical practice.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 647 ethnically diverse women with GDM was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine ethnic differences in cesarean delivery rates and emergency department (ED) utilization during pregnancy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate experiences of GDM and perceptions of type 2 diabetes risk. Results: Significant differences were observed between sample groups in mother's age (P = .004), education level (P < .001), family history of diabetes (P < .001), and baby birthweight (P = .004). In the fully adjusted model, controlling for maternal age, BMI category, ED utilization during pregnancy, and family history of diabetes, Southeast and East Asian women had the lowest rates of cesarean delivery and ED utilization during pregnancy, with significantly higher rates of cesarean delivery in Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and Asian Indian women (P < .001). There was preliminary evidence for higher ED utilization rates during pregnancy in Hispanic women with GDM (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% CI, 0.79-4.08; P = .005). Interview analyses reflected strong psychological impact of GDM diagnoses. Women expressed shock and disappointment over diagnoses and highlighted need for psychological support from health care professionals. Risk perceptions for type 2 diabetes were low. Conclusions: Findings support significant ethnic differences in cesarean delivery and ED utilization among women with GDM. Qualitative analysis suggests that culturally sensitive approaches informing psychosocial support and dietary recommendations are important considerations for a diverse GDM patient population.

This study explored HRQoL at 3 months postpartum in women with a history of one previous cesarean in three European countries. Methods: A prospective longitudinal survey, embedded within a cluster randomized trial in three countries, exploring women's postnatal HRQoL up to 3 months postpartum. The Short-Form Six-Dimensions (SF-6D) was used to measure HRQoL, and multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship with mode of birth. Results: Complete data were available from 880 women. Women with a spontaneous vaginal birth had the highest HRQoL scores, whereas women with an emergency repeat cesarean (P = .01) had the lowest. Postnatal readmission of the mother (P = .03), having public health insurance (P = .04), and a low antenatal HRQoL score (P < .01) contributes to poorer HRQoL scores. More specifically, women with a spontaneous vaginal birth had significantly higher HRQoL scores on the vitality dimension compared with women with an emergency repeat cesarean (P = .04). Conclusions: In women with low-risk factors, repeat cesareans result in a poorer HRQoL compared with vaginal birth. When there are no contraindications for vaginal birth, women with a history of one previous cesarean should be encouraged to give birth vaginally rather than have an elective repeat cesarean.

This increase raises the need for prenatal apps with evidence-based content that is personalized and reliable. Previous studies have looked at whether prenatal apps impact health and behavior outcomes among pregnant and postpartum individuals; however, research has been limited. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the use of a health system-sponsored mobile app--Circle by Providence--aimed at providing personalized and reliable health information on pregnancy, postpartum recovery, and infant care is associated with improved health outcomes and increased healthy behaviors and knowledge among users. Methods: This observational study compared app users and app nonusers using a self-reported survey and electronic medical records. The study took place over 18 months and was conducted at Providence St. Joseph Health in Portland, Oregon. The sample included patients who received prenatal care at one of seven Providence clinics and had a live birth at a Providence hospital. Recruitment occurred on a rolling basis and only those who completed the survey were included. Survey respondents were separated into app users and app nonusers, and survey responses and clinical outcomes were compared across groups using univariate and adjusted multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 567 participants were enrolled in the study--167 in the app user group and 400 in the nonuser group. We found statistically significant differences between the two groups for certain behavior outcomes: subjects who used the app had 75% greater odds of breastfeeding beyond 6 months postpartum (P=.012), were less likely to miss prenatal appointments (P=.046), and were 50% more likely to exercise 3 or more times a week during pregnancy (P=.04). There were no differences in nutritional measures, including whether they took prenatal vitamins, ate 5 fruits or vegetables a day, or drank caffeine. We found no differences in many of the infant care outcomes; however, there was an increase in awareness of 'purple crying.' Finally, there were no significant differences in measured clinical health outcomes, including cesarean births, length of hospital stays (in minutes), low birth weight infants, preterm births, small-for-gestational-age births, large-for-gestational-age births, and neonatal intensive care unit stays. Conclusions: The use of the Circle app, which provides access to personalized and evidence-based health information, was associated with an increase in certain healthy behaviors and health knowledge, although there was no impact on clinical health outcomes. More research is needed to determine the impact of mobile prenatal apps on healthy pregnancies, clinical health outcomes, and infant care.

Maternal and infant sociodemographic factors have also shown a strong association with psychological distress and the mother-infant relationship. However, findings on their effects over time are limited. In this longitudinal analysis, we explored the relationship of maternal and infant sociodemographic variables (maternal age, maternal education, marital status, being on social assistance, maternal race, infant birth weight, and infant gender) to maternal psychological distress (depressive, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, parenting stress symptoms, and maternal worry about child's health) through 12 months corrected age for prematurity, and on the home environment, and mother-infant interactions through 6 months corrected age for prematurity. We also explored differences related to maternal obstetrical characteristics (gestational age at birth, parity, mode of delivery, and multiple birth) and severity of infant conditions (Apgar scores, need for mechanical ventilation, and infant medical complications). Although the relationship of maternal and infant characteristics with these outcomes did not change over time, psychological distress differed based on marital status, maternal education, infant gender, and infant medical complications. Older mothers provided more a positive home environment. Mother-infant interactions differed by maternal age, being on public assistance, maternal race, infant gender, and infant medical complications. More longitudinal research is needed to better understand these effects over time in order to identify and support at-risk mothers.

The worldwide prevalence is 4.9% and 6.0%, whereas in Peru it is 7.4% and 1.9%, respectively. The causes of these problems are multifactorial and must be studied to prevent the multiple consequences on children's health. Methods: Secondary data analysis of the 2016 Demographic and Family Health Survey (DHS). The sample size was 7935 children and their mothers. The dependent variable was childhood overweight/obesity, measured according to the Z-score of the BMI >2 standard deviation (SD), while the main independent variable consisted of the maternal depressive symptoms (DS) (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score >10 points). The software STATA/MP 14.0 was used for statistical analysis. Results: The prevalence of overweight/obesity among children aged 0-5 years was 4.5% and the prevalence of moderate and severe maternal DS was 7.1%. No maternal depressive symptoms were found to be associated with the outcome [adjusted PR = 1.36 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59-3.09 p = 0.47]. An association was found between socioeconomic status (SES) Q3 (adjusted PR = 3.86 95% CI = 1.9-7.6 p < 0.0001), Q4 (adjusted PR = 5.53 95% CI = 2.76-11.1 p < 0.0001), Q5 (adjusted PR = 6.9 95% CI = 3.24-14.7 p = < 0.0001), maternal BMI (adjusted PR = 1.06 95% CI = 1.03-1.08 p < 0.0001), and cesarean delivery (adjusted PR = 1.42 95% CI = 1.01-1.99 p = 0.042).

Materials and Methods: An Italian cohort of 63 parturients, scheduled for elective cesarean section at a tertiary University Hospital, received spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine and morphine 100 mcg. For the first 48 hours in the postoperative period the patients received acetaminophen 1 g IV q6hr. Incident pain was treated with ketorolac 30 mg IV. Every 6 hours the following parameters were registered: VAS at rest, VAS during movements, postoperative nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and rescue analgesic medications requirements. Age and anthropometric data, number of pregnancies, educational level, OPRM1 genotype, were also obtained. Results: Of the 63 patients enrolled, 45 (71%) were homozygous genotype A/A (118A group), whereas 18 carried the G variants of OPRM1 (A/G or G/G) (118G group). No significant differences in analgesic rescue doses' administration and in incidence of moderate/severe postoperative pain (VAS > 3) between the 2 groups were observed. Pruritus was more frequent in the 118A group than in the 118G group in the first 24 hours of the postoperative period. Discussion: In the Italian population participating in this study there was a different incidence of pruritus in the postcesarean period in response to intrathecal opioids related to OPRM1 gene polymorphism, but not of postoperative pain.

Very little is known about BPD in pregnant women; hence, our study objective was to evaluate the effect of BPD on obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2003 to 2012. We identified births using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic and procedure codes and classified women by BPD status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of BPD on obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, adjusted for subject baseline characteristics. Findings: During the study period, there were 989 births to women with BPD with an overall incidence of 11.65 in 100,000 births. Women with BPD were more likely younger, of lower socioeconomic status, smoked or used drugs, and had an underlying mental disorder. Unadjusted models revealed that BPD was associated with an increased risk of almost all adverse maternal and fetal outcomes we examined, the exception being postpartum hemorrhage and instrumental delivery, which both had a null association with BPD, and induction of labor, which was negatively associated with BPD. Upon full adjustment, BPD was found to be associated with the following obstetrical and neonatal outcomes: gestational diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13-1.85), premature rupture of the membranes (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.83), chorioamnionitis (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.14-2.39), venous thromboembolism (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.12-3.96), caesarian delivery (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.26-1.64), and preterm birth (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.29-1.83). Conclusion: BPD is associated with several adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Hence, pregnant women who suffer from BPD should be monitored closely by a multidisciplinary health care team both before and during their pregnancies. This oversight would allow for the receipt of treatment for BPD and also interventions to help them to cease tobacco and drug use, which may ultimately decrease the incidence of poor obstetrical and neonatal outcomes.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study from a national database of 168 137 primiparous women with term, singleton, cephalic, vaginal delivery between 2008 and 2014. The main outcome measure was obstetric anal sphincter injury. A multivariate regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors. Results: Age > 19 years, birthweight > 4000 g, and operative vaginal delivery were independent risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Mediolateral episiotomy increased the risk for obstetric anal sphincter injuries in spontaneous vaginal birth (number needed to harm 333), whereas it was protective in vacuum delivery (number needed to treat 50). From 2008 to 2014, there was an increase in the rate of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (2.1% vs 3.1%, P < .01), vacuum deliveries (12.1% vs 12.8%, P < .01), and cesarean delivery after labor (17.1% vs 19.4%, P < .01), while forceps deliveries (0.4% vs 0.1%, P < .01) and episiotomy rate decreased (35.9% vs 26.4%, P < .01). Conclusions: Episiotomy may be a risk or protective factor depending on the type of episiotomy and the clinical setting in which it is used. Our study supports a restrictive use of mediolateral episiotomy in spontaneous vaginal deliveries. In vacuum deliveries mediolateral episiotomy may help prevent obstetric anal sphincter injuries.

Despite the co-prevalence of these two risk factors, their combined effects on maternal health are yet to be studied. The objective of this study was to examine the combined associations of overweight/obesity and depression with maternal and delivery complications. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of women with singleton gestations at > 20 weeks, in Ontario, Canada (April 2007 to March 2010), was conducted. Our primary outcomes were a composite of maternal complications (for example, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm premature rupture of membranes and so on), and a composite of delivery complications (for example, caesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia, postpartum haemorrhage and so on). Results: The study population consisted of 70 605 women, of whom 50.3% were overweight/obese. Depression was reported in 5.0% of normal-weight women and 6.2% of overweight/obese women. The proportion of women with maternal complications was the highest among the overweight/obese depressed pregnant women (16% of normal-weight non-depressed, 22% of normal-weight depressed, 22% of overweight/obese non-depressed and 29% of overweight/obese depressed, P < 0.001), as was the proportion of women with delivery complications (44%, 49%, 50% and 53%, respectively, P < 0.001). Overweight/obese depressed pregnant women also experienced the highest odds of the composite of maternal complications and the composite of delivery complications (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-1.77 and OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.13-1.42, respectively) after adjustment for potential confounders. Conclusions: The combined associations of excess weight and depression with adverse pregnancy outcomes are important to recognize in order to focus counselling and care, both before and during pregnancy.

Design: A retrospective cohort design. Setting: Data from 2009 to 2013 were abstracted from the health records of two out-of-hospital midwifery practices in the Pacific Northwest. Participants: Women with recorded serum blood samples for vitamin D during pregnancy were included. We reviewed health records of 663 women, and 357 met criteria. Methods: We extracted demographic, biometric, and pregnancy outcome data from participants' records and analyzed them using regression models. Results: Mean serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) was 29.96 +- 10.9 ng/ml; 45.5% of participants were sufficient (>= 30 ng/ml), and 55.5% were insufficient or deficient (< 29 ng/ml). Lower vitamin D levels were predicted by Seattle location, greater prepregnancy body mass index, and blood samples drawn during the winter. Vitamin D status was not a predictor of spontaneous abortion, glucose tolerance test result, cesarean birth, infant birth weight, or any other outcome investigated. Conclusion: Although there is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in pregnant women in the Pacific Northwest, adverse health effects were not observed. This may be attributable to the overall healthy profile of the women in our sample. Further research on maternal vitamin D status should focus on identification of optimal vitamin D levels in pregnancy and long-term outcomes among offspring of women who are vitamin D deficient, particularly those from high-risk, vulnerable populations.

Methods: Retrospective cohort study linking the 2001 National Census for Scotland and hospital obstetric data (2001-08), comparing maternal age, smoking status, gestational age, caesarean section rates, birthweight, preterm birth and breastfeeding rates by ethnic group. Results: In all, 144 344 women were identified as having had a first birth between 1 May 2001 and 30 April 2008. White Scottish mothers were younger [mean age 27.3 years; 95% confidence interval (CI): 27.3, 27.4] than other white groups and most non-white groups. They had the highest smoking rates (25.8%; CI: 25.5, 26.0) and the lowest rates of breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks (23.4%; CI: 23.1, 23.6), with most of the other groups being around 40%. Women from non-white minority ethnic groups in Scotland tended to have babies of lower birthweight (e.g. Pakistani mean birthweight-3105 g, white Scottish-3356 g), even after adjustment for gestational age, maternal age, education, smoking and housing tenure. This effect was more noticeable for women born in the UK. White English, Irish and other white babies tended to have higher birthweights. There was little variation between groups in caesarean section rates. Conclusions: Pregnant women from ethnic minority populations in Scotland have more favourable health behaviour than the white Scottish, although the non-white groups tend to have lower birthweight. Further exploration of the reasons for these differences has potential to benefit women from the majority population.

This study examined breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity in early and full term infants in a large US based sample. Methods: This secondary analysis included 743 geographically- and racially-diverse women from the Measurement of Maternal Stress Study cohort, and 295 women from a quality assessment at a hospital-based clinic in Evanston, IL. Only subjects delivering >= 37 weeks were included. Initiation of breastfeeding (IBF) and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) were assessed via electronic medical record review after discharge. Associations of IBF and EBF with early and full term delivery were assessed via univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Among 872 women eligible for inclusion, 85.7% IBF and 44.0% EBF. Early term delivery was not associated with any difference in frequency of IBF (p = 0.43), but was associated with significantly lower odds of EBF (unadjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.466, 0.803, p < 0.001). This association remained significant (adjusted OR 0.694, 95% CI 0.515, 0.935, p = 0.016) after adjusting for maternal diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, maternal age, race/ethnicity, parity, Medicaid status, NICU admission, current smoking, and delivery hospital. Conclusions for Practice: Despite comparable breastfeeding initiation frequencies, early term infants were significantly less likely to be exclusively breastfed compared to full term infants. These data suggest that women with early term infants may benefit from counseling regarding the potential for breastfeeding difficulties as well as additional breastfeeding support after delivery.

Although they have low rates of mortality, morbidity burden may be significant and involve neurological risk. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders and the influence of biological and socio-environmental factors on the neurodevelopment of MRN. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of 162 MRNs aged 2-24 months, who remained in NICU >= 72 h after birth, with gestational age (GA) >= 34 weeks, birth weight >= 1500 g, and normal neurological and clinical examinations by the time of hospital discharge. Four neurodevelopmental areas were assessed using the Argentinian test PRUNAPE: language (LG), fine and gross motor skills (FM and GM), and personal-social skills (PS). Data from biological (gestational, perinatal and postnatal) and socio-environmental factors were collected through parental questionnaires. Results: Thirty-four percent of infants failed the test. Gross motor was the most affected area (14.2%), followed by LG (11.7%), FM (7.4%), and PS (4.3%). Among gestational factors global failure was associated with drugs and alcohol consumption (p <= 0.029). Language was associated with maternal smoking (p = 0.007; OR 3.5), FM (p = 0.009; OR 13.0), and GM (p = 0.002; OR 10.6) with drug use, and both LG (p = 0.000; OR 22.6) and GM (p = 0.007; OR 16.2) with alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Infants born by cesarean had a higher risk of failure than those born by vaginal delivery (p = 0.049; OR: 2.2), as well as infants with pathological complementary diagnosis (p = 0.001; OR 2.7). Mechanical ventilation was associated with FM disorders (p = 0.025; OR 4.2). Children with siblings had a higher risk of failing the test than only children (p = 0.041; OR 2.0). Conclusions: Rate of neurodevelopmental disorders in MRN exceeds widely that of the general population. GM was the most affected area.

This was examined before, during and after the pregnancy. In addition, (HRQoL) was examined in relation to the mode of delivery. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of 416 couples was conducted in two teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The translated Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were used to measure health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms respectively, and are reported here. Results: The results showed that women and their spouses experienced a noticeable decline in their physical HRQoL during and after the pregnancy. However, their mental health functioning showed a significant improvement following conception. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was high but decreased over the course of the pregnancy. Finally, HRQoL was affected by mode of delivery. Conclusions: The results show that women and their husbands experienced marked changes in perceived health-related functioning and depressive symptoms during and after pregnancy. In addition, the study found that those women who had undergone Cesarean section had higher mental well-being scores. Future research should determine the benefits of extending pre-conception and pre-natal guidelines on the benefits of regular physical activity throughout and after pregnancy in Persian couples.

Methods: A pilot study of scripted counseling for women who had a previous cesarean about TOLAC versus ERCB was conducted at Boston Medical Center. Candidates for a TOLAC, receiving prenatal care from nurse-midwives in 2012 and 2013, were enrolled before 28 weeks' gestation. The women received 4 scripted counseling sessions during the routine prenatal visit, evidence-based information pamphlets, and an opportunity to review the hospital TOLAC consent form. Pre and post questionnaires were completed regarding birth preference, information sources, and decision factors. A midpoint assessment of the participants' knowledge of risks and benefits of TOLAC versus ERCB was conducted, and satisfaction with the intervention and outcome were assessed after the birth. Results: Twenty-two women participated in the study, and 20 completed all study questionnaires. More of the participants believed they had enough information after the intervention (95% after intervention vs 70% before the intervention). Reasons for choosing ERCB included being afraid of vaginal birth complications, having prior positive experience with cesarean, and convenience of knowing when the neonate will be born. Reasons for choosing a TOLAC included the personal importance of having a vaginal birth and that recovery is faster and easier. Few women cited concerns for their own safety and that of their newborns when choosing TOLAC. Discussion: Women were satisfied with the scripted counseling and found it useful in helping them make a birth mode decision. While the scripted counseling did not appear to influence preferred mode of birth, it appeared to help women follow through with the mode of birth they chose prenatally.

These experiences are often characterized by a loss of control coupled with a perceived lack of support and inadequate communication with health care providers. Little is known about the choices women make in subsequent pregnancy(s) and birth(s), or why they make these choices. This study aimed to understand these choices and explore the reasons behind them. Methods: A longitudinal grounded theory methods study involving nine women was conducted. Over half of the participants had a formal diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or PND related to the previous birth. Interviews were carried out at three timepoints perinatally. These findings are from the first interviews at 12-20 weeks. Results: From the first days of pregnancy, this cohort of women were focused on concerns that this birth would be a repeated traumatic experience. The women were deliberately searching out and analyzing information about their choices in this pregnancy and birth, and making plans which had two aims; firstly to avoid a repeat of their previous birth experience and secondly to avoid a loss of control to other people during the birth. The women considered a range of birth choices, from elective cesareans to freebirth. Some women felt well supported by those around them, including care providers, partners, friends, and family. Others did not feel supported and were anticipating conflict in trying to assert their birth choices. Many early relationships with healthcare professionals were characterized by fear and mistrust. Discussion: If women who have previously experienced a traumatic birth become pregnant again, they have a strong desire to avoid a repeat experience and to feel in control of their birth choices. Access to robust information appears to help reduce uncertainty and arm women in their discussions with professionals. Similarly making plans and seeking to have them agreed with care providers at an early stage is used a way to reduce the risk of having a further traumatic experience. Implications for practice include supporting women in formulating and confirming pregnancy and birth plans at an early stage to reduce uncertainty and foster a sense of control.

Thus, limited information is available about perinatal outcomes among various subgroups of Pacific Islanders in the United States, including immigrants from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We sought to evaluate perinatal outcomes among Marshallese women. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of women with at least one singleton live birth between 1997 and 2013 in two Arkansas counties using birth certificate data from the Arkansas Department of Health. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from modified Poisson regression models. Results: Of the 91,662 singleton births in both counties during the study period, 2488 were to Marshallese women. In adjusted analyses, Marshallese women had higher prevalence of 'other medical risk factors' (PR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.30, 1.65) than NH White women. Marshallese women had higher rates of precipitous labor and fetal distress during labor compared to NH White women (PR = 2.65; 95% CI 2.22, 3.17 and 1.89; 95% CI 1.62, 2.21, respectively). Marshallese were also more likely to have tocolysis (PR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.16, 1.76), forceps (PR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.16, 2.43) or vacuum (PR = 1.89; 95% CI 1.60, 2.22) used in delivery and cesarean section (PR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.01, 1.27). Marshallese infants had higher rates of anemia (PR = 3.10; 95% CI 2.01, 4.77), birth injury (PR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.50, 3.03), assisted ventilation < 30 min (PR = 2.11; 95% CI 1.64, 2.71), preterm birth (PR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.50, 1.83), and small-for-gestational age (PR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.12, 1.39) than NH White infants. Conclusions: Marshallese women and infants had higher rates of adverse perinatal outcomes compared to their NH White counterparts.

Design: Cross-sectional analysis of administrative data from patient discharge records. Setting: Urban academic medical center in the northeastern United States. Participants: Women admitted for childbirth (N = 17,905). Methods: Differences among participants with and without depression and/or anxiety present on admission were compared using t tests and chi-square tests. Risk-adjusted logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of depression and/or anxiety and any psychiatric diagnosis on 7-, 30-, 60-, 90-, and 180-day readmissions after childbirth. Results: Significant differences were noted between participants with (n = 1,169) and without (n = 16,736) depression and/or anxiety. Participants with these diagnoses had a higher mean age and a longer mean length of stay during hospitalization for childbirth. A greater proportion of these participants were White, were single, had cesarean births, and were discharged with home health services. The presence of depression and/or anxiety was not significantly associated with readmission. The effect of having any psychiatric diagnosis was significantly associated with a greater risk of readmission at 7 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, p = .100), 30 (OR = 1.45, p = .030), 60 (OR = 1.45, p = .026), 90 (OR = 1.56, p = .004), and 180 days (OR =1.74, p < .001) following discharge after childbirth.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between obstetric mode of delivery and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Perinatal factors and ASD diagnoses based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), were identified from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Swedish National Patient Register. We conducted stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to examine the effect of mode of delivery on ASD. We then used conditional logistic regression to perform a sibling design study, which consisted of sibling pairs discordant on ASD status. Analyses were adjusted for year of birth (ie, partially adjusted) and then fully adjusted for various perinatal and sociodemographic factors. The population-based cohort study consisted of all singleton live births in Sweden from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 2010. Children were followed up until first diagnosis of ASD, death, migration, or December 31, 2011 (end of study period), whichever came first. The full cohort consisted of 2 697 315 children and 28 290 cases of ASD. Sibling control analysis consisted of 13 411 sibling pairs. EXPOSURES Obstetric mode of delivery defined as unassisted vaginal delivery (VD), assisted VD, elective CS, and emergency CS (defined by before or after onset of labor). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ASD status as defined using codes from the ICD-9 (code 299) and ICD-10 (code F84). RESULTS In adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, elective CS (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95%CI, 1.15-1.27) and emergency CS (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95%CI, 1.10-1.20) were associated with ASD when compared with unassisted VD. In the sibling control analysis, elective CS was not associated with ASD in partially (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95%CI, 0.85-1.11) or fully adjusted (OR, 0.89; 95%CI, 0.76-1.04) models. Emergency CS was significantly associated with ASD in partially adjusted analysis (OR, 1.20; 95%CI, 1.06-1.36), but this effect disappeared in the fully adjusted model (OR, 0.97; 95%CI, 0.85-1.11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study confirms previous findings that children born by CS are approximately 20%more likely to be diagnosed as having ASD. However, the association did not persist when using sibling controls, implying that this association is due to familial confounding by genetic and/or environmental factors.

Background: The mother's and baby's health is considered a priority during childbirth. As a result, situations in which an unplanned C-section is required may not allow mothers to express their needs and emotions. This may lead to feelings of dissatisfaction regarding the childbirth experience. Methods: Fifty French participants aged 18-35 (M = 27.10; S. D. = 3.99) who had a C-section were recruited on social networking groups and completed four self-report measures online, up to two years after childbirth. These measures assessed emotion regulation strategies currently used, birth satisfaction, postpartum depression symptoms and PTSD symptoms. Results: Main results indicate (1) Mothers who use expressive suppression, a response-focused strategy, are less satisfied with childbirth. (2) Emotion regulation, when combined with maternal satisfaction, shows a negative association with posttraumatic stress score and depression score. Conclusion: This study provides interesting data for further research. Follow-up studies about emotion regulation, postpartum depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms should be conducted in the future in order to provide clinical recommendations.

Our objective was to explore women's experience and wellbeing following a complicated birth within this context. Research methodology/design: A cross-sectional study captured women's experience through a postal survey four weeks post birth. Setting: A convenience sample of 112 women who received care in the first 24 hours of their stay in a Western Australian maternity high dependency unit. Main outcome measures: A validated tool designed to explore patients' intensive care experience was modified and six items were added based upon the literature and in consultation with clinicians. Results: Women felt they were given choice (78%; n = 86); were not glad to be transferred to a ward (62%; n = 68) and were in pain during the first 24 hours of their admission (70%; n = 78). Women who did not feel scared were more likely than those who felt scared to have a clinician explain what had happened (95% vs 78%, P = 0.007); were more likely to feel in control (94% vs 75%, P = 0.006); and were less likely to feel helpless (27% vs 62%, P = < 0.001). Conclusion: The transfer experience to a postpartum ward requires further investigation as does the management of pain for these childbearing women regardless of their birth mode.

In the present study the authors investigated and compared the intrapersonal and interpersonal factors that might be associated with FOC among women who previously gave birth (parous) and women who did not. A cross sectional survey was conducted among 529 women (parous women (n = 365) and women who had never given birth (n = 173). All participants completed self-report measures using an online survey system. The questionnaires assessed intrapersonal factors including attitudes toward pregnancy and birth, body image, self-esteem and life satisfaction as well as interpersonal factors namely relationship satisfaction. Multiple regression analyses revealed that among parous women age and attitudes toward pregnancy and birth, especially those that relate to body image and delivery were significantly associated with FOC. Among women who had never given birth, only attitudes toward pregnancy and birth, especially those that relate to body image, importance of pregnancy and delivery, and preference of caesarean section (CS), were significantly associated with FOC. In both groups, satisfaction with spousal relationship was not found to be associated with FOC. The results indicate that regarding FOC, intra-personal factors are more dominant than inter-personal factors. When assessing this medico-psychological fear, cognitive aspects should also be addressed.

However, the relationship between toileting behaviours and lower urinary tract symptoms is unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms among female nurses, and the association between toileting behaviours and lower urinary tract symptoms. Design: A cross-sectional stratified cluster sampling study. Participants: A total of 636 female clinical nurses from tertiary hospitals in Jinan (the capital city of Shandong Province, China). Methods: The Toileting Behaviour-Women's Elimination Behaviours and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms scales were used to assess the participants' toileting behaviours and lower urinary tract symptoms, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between toileting behaviours and lower urinary tract symptoms. Results: Unhealthy toileting behaviours were common among the female nurses, with delayed voiding being the unhealthiest toileting behaviour, which was followed by place and position preference for voiding. Nearly 68% of the female nurses had at least one lower urinary tract symptom, nearly 50% had incontinence symptoms, 40% had filling symptoms, and 18% had voiding symptoms. Unhealthy toileting behaviours (premature voiding, delayed voiding, and straining to void) were positively associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. However, lower urinary tract symptoms were not significantly associated with voiding place or position preference. Among the control variables, being married or having a history of a urinary tract infection was associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. Having a higher income and regular menstrual period were negatively associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. Compared with vaginal delivery, caesarean delivery had a protective association with lower urinary tract symptoms. Conclusion: Lower urinary tract symptoms among female nurses should not be overlooked, because their prevalence among female clinical nurses exceeded that among the general population of women. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding unhealthy toileting behaviours (especially premature voiding, delayed voiding, and straining to void), as these unhealthy toileting behaviours were significantly associated with susceptibility to lower urinary tract symptoms.

Background: While maternal-request CS is a growing phenomenon, studies are lacking regarding personality variables that may be associated with it. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire was conducted in one delivery ward. During 2009, 59 primigravida, healthy women were recruited; 28 who had requested and delivered by CS without an obstetrical indication and 31 who opted for a spontaneous vaginal delivery. Due to missing data for some measures, only 27 participants were analysed in each group. All women completed the fear of childbirth (FOC) questionnaire, and the object relations (SCORS) and unconscious defences (DMM) measures of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), as well as questionnaires assessing background variables. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and a logistic hierarchical multiple regression were performed. Results: Preliminary MANOVA showed significant differences between groups in age, FOC and use of the defence mechanism projection. Hence, these variables entered as predictors of maternal-request CS to a logistic hierarchical multiple regression model. The model was found to have a good fit [kh2 (4) = 38.19, p < 0.001]. Age, FOC and projection defence were found to be significant factors associated with maternal-request CS. Conclusion: Maternal-request CS was found to be strongly associated with age and FOC. Except for unconscious defence of projection, intrapsychic variables were not found to be associated with maternal -request CS. Possible implications are discussed.

Method: Data in this cross-sectional study were gathered from healthcare centres of Zahedan, a city in south-east Iran. Four-hundred women with childbirth experience over the past few months were selected; between 6 and 24 weeks had passed since their delivery. We used three questionnaires in order to evaluate the demographic data, PTSD symptoms and traumatic childbirth experience. Results: The mean parity was 3.40 +- 2.55 children and the mean duration of pain was 19.44 +- 9.16 hours. Overall, 7.8%, 36% and 0.5% of the subjects had a previous history of curettage, episiotomy and vacuum evacuation, respectively. In total, 32% of the participants showed PTSD symptoms. Prevalence of PTSD was not significantly associated with parity, pain duration, education level or employment status. Significant correlation with PTSD was found with the mode of delivery (P = 0.013), curettage (P = 0.005) and length of hospitalization. Also, prevalence of PTSD was substantially associated with the type of pregnancy (planned or unintended) (P = 0.011). Conclusion: Women with PTSD were not significantly different from those without PTSD in terms of parity, pain duration, education level or employment status. History of curettage, episiotomy and vacuum evacuation increased the incidence of PTSD in postpartum women. Moreover, unwanted pregnancy was more common among women with PTSD compared with normal subjects and length of hospitalization was longer.

Methods: Retrospective chart review of pregnant Hispanic women of Mexican origin (N = 95), with GDM (N = 41) or one abnormal 3-hour OGTT value (N = 54) who delivered between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups with regard to sociodemographic variables, hyperbilirubinemia, or other adverse neonatal outcomes. Comparisons identified differences between women with and without adverse neonatal outcomes concerned type of delivery; there were more C-sections among women with GDM. Conclusion: Pregnant women with one abnormal 3-hour OGTT value are at risk of giving birth to neonates with biomarkers similar to those diagnosed and treated for GDM. The treatment of hyperglycemia in Hispanic women of Mexican origin with one abnormal 3-hour OGTT value may improve the health outcomes and quality of life of the mother and the neonate. More research is warranted to clarify the risk of adverse outcomes of diverse pregnant women who do not meet guidelines for diagnosis of GDM.

Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study of 55,352 term singleton deliveries at the Mater Mothers' Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, was conducted. The study cohort was stratified into six groups based on the World Health Organization's body mass index classification. The normal body mass index category was the reference group for all comparisons. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the effect of maternal body mass index, adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, parity, and preexisting conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus and hypertension), on selected intrapartum and neonatal outcomes. Results: Women in the overweight and Obese I, II, and III categories were more likely to have chronic or gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, and preexisting or gestational diabetes mellitus. They also had an increased risk for induction of labor, elective and emergency cesarean, and postpartum hemorrhage. Underweight women were less likely to require induction of labor and emergency cesarean. Infants born to women with increased body mass index were more likely to require neonatal resuscitation, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and have lower Apgar scores at 5 minutes. Conclusion: There is an increased risk of adverse intrapartum and neonatal outcomes for women who are overweight and obese, with the risks increasing with rising body mass index. Appropriately targeted weight management strategies and health education may yield improved maternal and perinatal outcomes if effectively implemented before pregnancy. These may particularly be of benefit in the teenage cohort that has yet to embark on pregnancy.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of candidates for VBAC at a tertiary center in Japan from April 2003 to March 2012. Women with singleton gestations and one prior low-transverse cesarean delivery who intended VBAC at 36 weeks of gestation were identified as candidates for VBAC and included in the study. Participants were managed without induction or augmentation of labor. Maternal characteristics and perinatal outcomes were obtained from medical records. Factors associated with successful VBAC were analyzed with a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Of 333 candidates for VBAC, 242 (72.7%) had vaginal birth, 49 (14.7%) had repeat cesarean delivery with spontaneous labor, and 42 (12.6%) had repeat cesarean delivery without spontaneous labor. The rate of uterine rupture was 0.3% (1/333). Prior vaginal delivery and nonrecurring indications for prior cesarean delivery were associated with successful VBAC. Conclusions: Management of candidates for VBAC without induction or augmentation of labor resulted in a high VBAC rate and favorable perinatal outcomes.

External cephalic version is an effective intervention that can decrease the need for cesarean delivery; however, timely identification of breech presentation is required. We hypothesized that women with a fetus in a breech presentation that is diagnosed after 38 weeks' estimated gestational age have a decreased likelihood of external cephalic version attempted and an increased likelihood of cesarean delivery. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. A chart review was performed for 251 women with breech presentation at term presenting to our tertiary referral university hospital for external cephalic version, cesarean for breech presentation, or vaginal breech delivery. Results: Vaginal delivery was significantly more likely (31.1% vs 12.5%; P < .01) in women with breech presentation diagnosed before 38 weeks' estimated gestational age as external cephalic version was offered, and subsequently attempted in a greater proportion of women diagnosed before 38 weeks. External cephalic version was more successful when performed by physicians with greater procedural volume during the 3.5 year period of the study (59.1% for providers performing at least 10 procedures vs 31.3% if performing fewer than 10 procedures, P < .01). Conclusions: Results support the need for interventions to increase timely diagnosis of breech presentation as well as improved patient counseling and use of experienced providers for external cephalic version.

This study assessed the relationship between mode of delivery and atopic dermatitis and asthma in Korean adolescents. Methods: Data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2010 and 2011 were used. We included 1302 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The odds ratio (OR) of having atopic dermatitis in adolescents born by Caesarean section compared with vaginal delivery was 1.50, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.01-2.22, after adjusting for age and sex. The association remained significant after further adjustments for body mass index, breastfeeding and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05-2.47) and when fat intake was added to those variables (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.14-2.85). However, asthma was not associated with mode of delivery in any of the models. Conclusions: Atopic dermatitis in adolescents was associated with Caesarean delivery, which is common in South Korea.

Design: This is a retrospective 2-year evaluation of antenatal care. Setting and participants: Two hundred thirteen pregnant women in Aboriginal communities in the Fitzroy Valley of Western Australia participated in this study. Intervention: The implementation of a midwifery-led interdisciplinary model of antenatal outreach care. Main outcome measures: The indicators measured were numbers of antenatal visits, their location and quality care indicators (presentation in first trimester, alcohol and smoking, ultrasound and blood-borne virus screening) and outcome indicators (birth weight, prematurity, in utero deaths and mode of delivery). Results: There was an increase in access to antenatal care and improvements in quality-of-care indicators. The proportion of visits provided in local Aboriginal communities increased from 10% to 24%. There were statistically significant increases in women presenting in the first trimester (40-58%), screening for alcohol and smoking (48-93%) and having an ultrasound in pregnancy (59-94%). There were no significant improvements in neonatal outcome indicators. Conclusion: There is a large disparity in maternal and child health outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) and non-Indigenous Australians thought to be due to decreased access to antenatal care, poorer socioeconomic status and the associated risk factors. The change in model of care resulted in earlier presentation for antenatal care, increased numbers of antenatal visits and increased screening for risk factors.

In this longitudinal study from Helsinki University Central Hospital, we investigated FOC, depression, and posttraumatic stress in the partners of women with severe FOC, and possible effects of group psychoeducation and mode of birth. Methods: During pregnancy, 250 partners of nulliparous women with severe FOC participated, 93 in the intervention group and 157 in the control group. At 3 months postpartum, 52 partners in the intervention group and 93 in the control group participated. Both the partners and the childbearing women filled in the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/ Experience Questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale mid-pregnancy as well as 3 months postpartum, when they also filled in the Traumatic Event Scale. Results: Partners of women with severe FOC reported less antenatal and postnatal FOC and fewer depressive symptoms than the childbearing women. No partner reached the threshold of severe FOC. No partner reported a possible posttraumatic stress disorder. Group psychoeducation with relaxation was not associated with better or worse psychological well-being of the partners. An emergency cesarean delivery was associated with a more fearful delivery experience in the partners. Conclusion: Partners of nulliparous women with severe FOC neither seem to suffer from severe FOC nor reported posttraumatic stress symptoms after childbirth. They reported better psychological well-being than the mothers both during pregnancy and after delivery. An unexpected cesarean may be a negative experience even for partners of childbearing women.

The objective of this prospective, collaborative study, was to assess outcomes of pregnancies fathered by MS patients undergoing DMD. Methods: Structured interviews on pregnancies fathered by MS patients gathered in the Italian Pregnancy Dataset were collected; pregnancies were divided according to father exposure or unexposure to DMD at time of procreation. Treatment were compared with multivariable logistic and linear models. Results: Seventy-eight pregnancies fathered by MS patients were tracked. Forty-five patients were taking DMD at time of conception (39 beta-interferons, 6 glatiramer acetate), while 33 pregnancies were unexposed to DMD. Seventy-five pregnancies ended in live-births, 44 in the exposed and 31 in the unexposed group. No significant differences between the two groups were found in the risk of spontaneous abortion or malformations (p > 0.454), mean gestational age (p = 0.513), frequency of cesarean delivery (p = 0.644), birth weight (p = 0.821) and birth length (p = 0.649). In comparison with data of the Italian general population, the proportion of spontaneous abortion and caesarean delivery in exposed pregnancies fell within the estimates, while the proportion of pre-term delivery in the exposed group was higher than expected. Conclusions: Our data indicate no association between paternal DMD exposure at time of conception and risk of spontaneous abortion, adverse fetal outcomes and congenital malformations.

A positive correlation was found between postpartum depression and depressive symptomatology in the first trimester; however after the regression analysis neuroticism was the only factor that predicted postpartum depressive symptoms, explaining 24.8% of the variance. Neuroticism significantly influences psychological health during life events such as motherhood. Due to its stable condition, personality could be assessed from the beginning of pregnancy, contributing to the care of pregnant women with high scores in neuroticism, to prevent, detect and treat early postnatal depression.

We examined reasons for referral, management of labor, and maternal and neonatal outcomes among women who were referred during labor. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, descriptive analyses were performed on data obtained from patient records. Six purposively chosen hospitals in The Netherlands participated in the study from June 2011 to February 2012. The study population included 600 pregnant women who were referred during labor from primary to secondary care. Main outcome measures: Reasons for referral, interventions after referral, mode of delivery, and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results: Of women who were referred during labor, three out of four women were referred for moderate risk indications: request for pain relief (30.5%), meconium-stained liquor (25.3%), failure to progress during first stage of labor (14.0%), and prolonged ruptured membranes without contractions (12.5%). Of all women, 65.7 percent had a spontaneous vaginal delivery and 59.7 percent received some kind of pain relief. Acute referral, meaning fetal distress, occurred in 5.5 percent. Of the newborns, 2.7 percent had an Apgar score of 7 or less after 5 minutes and 1.2 percent had an umbilical cord pH < 7.05. Postpartum complications occurred among 11.0 percent of women. Conclusion: Women who are referred during labor have a high probability of spontaneous vaginal delivery.

The guidelines are also the same for prepregnancy obesity classes I through III. Objective: Considering these literature gaps, we aim to (1) determine the association between the IOM GWG guidelines and three common pregnancy complications: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and cesarean delivery in a racially and ethnically diverse population; and (2) assess whether the association between GWG and pregnancy complications differs by race/ethnicity or prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) categories, particularly obesity classes I through III. Methods: To address these aims, we analyzed data from the Boston Birth Cohort. We calculated GWG using data from electronic medical records or, when missing, from a postdelivery questionnaire. We examined GWG continuously and categorically using the IOM formula. Results: Of the 5,568 women included, 54.5% met the IOM criterion for excessive GWG. Compared to women who had adequate GWG, women who gained excessive weight had 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-2.14) times greater odds of preeclampsia; 1.68 (95% CI 1.15-2.46) times greater odds of gestational diabetes; and no significant change in odds of cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.14, 95% CI 0.99-1.31). Associations did not differ by race, ethnicity, or prepregnancy BMI categories including comparisons of obesity class I versus II or III (all p-values for interaction > 0.05). Conclusions: In this racially and ethnically diverse population, excessive GWG was associated with higher odds of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and nonsignificantly, with cesarean delivery. Associations did not differ appreciably by race, ethnicity, or prepregnancy BMI categories. Our results support the relevance of the IOM GWG recommendations in racially and ethnically diverse populations, and in women in the higher prepregnancy obesity classes.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the direct and indirect expenses associated with caesarean interventions performed in EmONC and the factors associated with these expenses. Data sampling followed the case control approach used in the large project (deceased and near-miss women). Our sample consisted of a total of 190 women who underwent caesarean interventions. Data were collected from the health workers and with a social approach by administering questionnaires to the persons who accompanied the woman. Household socioeconomic status was assessed using a wealth index constructed with a principal component analysis. The factors significantly associated with expenses were determined using multivariate linear regression analyses. Women in the Kayes region spent on average 77,017 FCFA (163 USD) for a caesarean episode in EmONC, of which 70 % was for treatment. Despite the caesarean fee exemption, 91 % of the women still paid for their treatment.

Our primary objective was to calculate the rate of cesarean delivery, 5-min Apgar score < 7, and preterm birth among Chinese and Western women. Our secondary objective was to examine whether there are significant differences in terms of risk factors between Western immigrants who chose to deliver in their country of citizenship compared to those who chose to deliver in China. Methods: Single-center retrospective cohort study in Shanghai, China. Multivariate logistic regression models used delivery outcome, and place of delivery (China vs. country of citizenship) as outcome variables. Results: Preterm birth occurred at a rate of 3.82% among Chinese citizens, 4.12% among Chinese-born Western citizens, and 6.54% among non-Chinese-born Western citizens. After adjustment, preterm birth < 37 weeks was more frequent among non-Chinese-born Western citizens compared with Chinese citizens, with an odds ratio of 1.82 (Confidence Interval 1.20-2.78), p = 0.005. Variables statistically associated with giving birth in China were maternal age >= 35 years and being Chinese-born Western, as well as the absence of medical or obstetrical conditions. Discussion: Western immigrants have overall good obstetrical outcomes in China, and this could be partly explained by selective immigration, but also by the Salmon bias, as women with risk factors tend to return to their country of citizenship for the delivery. However, the preterm birth rate was higher among Western women than in their Chinese counterparts, and further research is needed.

Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study that included 1730 women with a single live birth in Palau between January 2007 and December 2014. Results: The overall prevalence of GDM among women in Palau was 5.5%. Women who were older (>= 30 years) or obese (BMI >= 30) were more likely to have GDM than women who were younger (< 30 years) or non-obese (BMI < 30), respectively. When adverse birth outcomes were assessed, women with GDM were found to have significantly higher prevalence of high birth weight infants, cesarean sections, and neonatal deaths when compared to women without GDM. In fact, women with GDM were five times more likely to have a neonatal death than women without GDM (p = 0.008). Conclusion: Reducing overall rates of obesity in the population could help reduce rates of diabetes and GDM in Palau. Based on this work, current practices for the identification, monitoring and treatment of women with GDM should be evaluated and strengthened in order to reduce neonatal mortality rates in Palau.

Home visiting (HV) is an established approach to improve the health of children and families, parenting practices, and connections to social and health services. Many HV programs target first-time mothers, in part because HV activities related to a first-birth may improve birth outcomes for subsequent children, but few researchers have examined these effects. We will link data from a statewide HV program (Nurturing Families Network [NFN]) to birth certificate data to create comparison groups and measure outcomes in this observational study. Specifically, we will compare birth outcomes for NFN second-children (n = 3000) to those for: (a) first-child older siblings whose birth/gestation led to NFN enrollment (n = 3000); (b) second children of families who were screened as eligible for NFN, but not offered the program due to home visitor availability and other logistical reasons (n = 650); and (c) non-NFN second children in a propensity-score-matched group created using the likelihood of enrollment in NFN based on maternal health, demographics, and neighborhood characteristics (n = 6000). The outcomes we will examine are birth spacing, prenatal care received, cesarean section rate, gestational age, and birth weight in second-children. We will also examine the associations between program attendance (i.e., missed visits, dropout) and birth outcomes, that will generate evidence that may be used in programmatic decisions regarding continued funding and/or modification of NFN, prioritization of specific retention efforts, and targeting of first-time mothers. Use of this evidence should improve outcomes for future NFN families and may inform similar programs.

Materials and Methods: Data of women who had undergone cesarean delivery (CD cohort) or vaginal delivery (VD cohort) between January 2000 and December 2012 from Taiwan Health Insurance Database were analyzed. All subjects were tracked until December 31, 2013. For women with multiple deliveries, only the first delivery data were included. Study end point was the diagnosis of new-onset CHD after delivery. Results: In total, 51,765 subjects (CD cohort: n = 17,839; VD cohort: n = 33,926) were included. During 1-14 years of follow-up, the incidence rate of new-onset CHD in the CD cohort was significantly higher than in the VD cohort (1.3% [231/17,839] vs. 0.8% [257/33,926], p < 0.001; effect size: 0.30). Analysis revealed that the subsequent risk of CHD in the CD cohort was significantly higher than in the VD cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.06-1.55, p = 0.012). We performed sensitivity tests by excluding subjects who had undergone CD due to nonmedical reasons from the CD cohort. The remaining subjects were named as the CD cohort. Analysis also revealed a higher subsequent risk of CHD in the CD cohort than in the VD cohort (adjusted HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.08-1.60, p = 0.006). Conclusions: Women who had undergone primary CD, especially those who had undergone CD due to medical reasons, were associated with an ~30% higher risk of CHD than those who had undergone VD.

Methods: A retrospective review of all cases of EPH over a 4 year period was done. EPH was defined as hysterectomy performed at the time of delivery or within 24 h of delivery for uncontrollable postpartum bleeding not responsive to conservative measures. Relevant information was extracted from the hospital records and operation notes. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 17.0. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: There were 102 EPHs performed among 39,738 deliveries within the study period, giving a rate of 2.6 per thousand deliveries. Indications were uterine rupture (44.1 %), uterine atony (37.3 %), morbidly adherent placenta (17.6 %) and extension of caesarean section incision involving the uterine arteries (1 %). Subtotal hysterectomy was performed in most cases (67.6 %).Maternal case fatality rate was 11.8 % and perinatal mortality rate was 55.9 %. Blood transfusion, severe postoperative anaemia, wound sepsis, febrile morbidity and acute kidney injury were common morbidities associated with the procedure. Following multivariate logistic regression, the unbooked status [odds-ratio 95 % CI = 12.80 (1.22-133.97) p = 0.03] was the only variable that significantly predicted maternal death. Conclusion: The incidence of EPH from our study is high. Much more needs to be done in maternal health services, particularly provision of quality obstetric care to reduce the rates of EPH and the associated high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out by accessing the maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) database to identify and review records of singleton pregnancies with epilepsy but with no other underlying disease (study group). A parallel group of low-risk pregnancies was randomly allocated as the control group. The adverse outcomes between the two groups were compared. The primary outcomes included rates of spontaneous abortion, small for gestational age (SGA), preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and preeclampsia. Results: From a total of 44,708 deliveries, 148 pregnancies involving mothers with epilepsy and a control group of 1480 normal pregnancies were compared. The rates of spontaneous abortion, PTB, LBW, and cesarean section were slightly but significantly higher in the study group with a relative risk of 6.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9-23.3), 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.2), 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.3), and 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1-2.1), respectively, whereas other adverse outcomes were comparable. In the subgroup analysis, adverse outcomes tended to be higher in women with active epilepsy. However, only the rates of SGA in the group in which the disorder is active and PTB in the presence of seizures within 6months of conception were significantly increased. Conclusions: Pregnancies with epilepsy, even in cases with multidisciplinary care and no other risk factors, are still significantly associated with higher adverse outcomes.

Methods: In a prospective observational study, the INVOS 5100C and FORE-SIGHT were compared on 12 term newborns delivered by elective caesarean section. During the 10 min following umbilical cord clamping, cStO2 was measured simultaneously with the neonatal sensors from each device. Repeated measurements were taken the following day. Results: Three and 8 min after clamping, the mean cStO2 value increased from 53.4% (CI 36.8-69.9%) to 86.0% (CI 80.2-91.7%) for INVOS and from 61.6% (CI 55.4-67.8%) to 82.2% (CI 77.7-86.7%) for FORE-SIGHT. The Bland-Altman plot revealed decreasing difference (INVOS minus FORE-SIGHT) (D) in absolute values (A) with increasing cStO2 (D = 0.5A-38.19 p = <0.001). The mean steady-state value on day two was 78.4% (CI 74.6-82.2%) and 86.2% (CI 85.0-87.4%) for INVOS and FORE-SIGHT, respectively. The within-subject standard deviation during steady-state repeated measurements was 4.8% +- 0.86 for INVOS and 2.8% +- 0.5 for FORE-SIGHT. Conclusion: The INVOS and FORE-SIGHT cStO2 estimates showed oxygenation-level-dependent difference during birth transition. The better repeatability of FORE-SIGHT could be due to the lower response to change in saturation.

Aim: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical risk factors of CUI in women with urinary incontinence (UI), and to measure the impact of CUI on women's sexuality and quality of life. Methods: This was a multicenter international study, conducted in Italy, Greece, the United States, and Egypt. Inclusion criteria were: sexually active women with UI and in a stable relationship for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria were: age <18 years and unstable relationship. The UI was classified as stress UI (SUI), urgency UI (UUI), and mixed UI (MUI). Women completed a questionnaire on demographics and medical history, in particular on UI and possible CUI and the timing of its occurrence, and the impact of CUI on quality and frequency of their sexual life. Main Outcome Measures: To evaluate the CUI and its impact on sexual life we used the open questions on CUI as well as the International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaire and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition questionnaire. Results: In this study 1,041 women (age 52.4 +- 10.7 years) were included. In all, 53.8% of women had CUI: 8% at penetration, 35% during intercourse, 9% at orgasm, and 48% during a combination of these. Women with CUI at penetration had a higher prevalence of SUI, women with CUI during intercourse had higher prevalence of MUI with predominant SUI, and women with CUI at orgasm had higher prevalence of UUI and MUI with predominant UUI component. Previous hysterectomy was a risk factor for CUI during any phase, while cesarean delivery was a protective factor. Previous failed anti-UI surgery was a risk factor for CUI during penetration and intercourse, and body mass index >25 kg/m2 was a risk factor for CUI at intercourse. According to International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaire scores, increased severity of UI positively correlated with CUI, and had a negative impact on the quality and frequency of sexual activity. Clinical Implications: This study should encourage physicians to evaluate the CUI; in fact, it is an underestimated clinical problem, but with a negative impact on quality of life. Strengths & Limitations: The strength of this study is the large number of women enrolled, while the limitation is its observational design. Conclusion: CUI is a symptom that can affect sexual life and should be investigated during counseling in all patients who are referred to urogynecological centers.

Antenatal, perinatal and neonatal factors affecting motor development from late childhood to adolescence were explored. As sex differences in motor development have been previously reported, males and females were examined separately. Methods: Participants (n = 2868) were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort Study. Obstetric and neonatal data were examined to determine factors related to motor development at 10 (n = 1622), 14 (n = 1584) and 17 (n = 1221) years. The Neuromuscular Development Index (NDI) of the McCarron Assessment of Motor Development determined offspring motor proficiency. Linear mixed models were developed to allow for changes in motor development over time. Results: Maternal pre-eclampsia, Caesarean section and low income were negatively related to male and female motor outcomes. Lower percentage of optimal birthweight was related to a lower male NDI. Younger maternal age, smoking during early pregnancy and stress during later pregnancy were related to lower female NDIs. Conclusion: Events experienced during pregnancy were related to motor development into late adolescence. Males and females were influenced differently by antenatal and perinatal risk factors; this may be due to sex-specific developmental pathways.

We assessed the association between mode of delivery and later onset of psychosis in the offspring. A population-based cohort including data from the Swedish National Registers was used. All singleton live births between 1982 and 1995 were identified (n = 1 345 210) and followed-up to diagnosis at age 16 or later. Mode of delivery was categorized as: unassisted vaginal delivery (VD), assisted VD, elective Caesarean section (CS) (before onset of labor), and emergency CS (after onset of labor). Outcomes included any psychosis; nonaffective psychoses (including schizophrenia only) and affective psychoses (including bipolar disorder only and depression with psychosis only). Cox regression analysis was used reporting partially and fully adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sibling-matched Cox regression was performed to adjust for familial confounding factors. In the fully adjusted analyses, elective CS was significantly associated with any psychosis (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03, 1.24). Similar findings were found for nonaffective psychoses (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99, 1.29) and affective psychoses (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05, 1.31) (kh2 for heterogeneity P = .69). In the sibling-matched Cox regression, this association disappeared (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78, 1.37). No association was found between assisted VD or emergency CS and psychosis. This study found that elective CS is associated with an increase in offspring psychosis. However, the association did not persist in the sibling-matched analysis, implying the association is likely due to familial confounding by unmeasured factors such as genetics or environment.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of maternal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy and provide scientific basis for reducing prenatal mental disorders. Methods: Data were obtained from 1220 women with < 15 weeks gestation in a cohort study conducted in Chongqing, China. Prenatal stress, anxiety and depression were assessed using the pregnancy pressure scale, the Hamilton anxiety scale, and the self-rating depression scale, respectively. Results: The prevalence of prenatal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy was 91.86%, 15.04% and 5.19%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors for prenatal stress include housewife/unemployment, presence of anxiety and low- and moderate-level social support, besides, the protective factors were exercise, active smoking and no suggestion from parents. Housewife/unemployment, primiparity, presence of stress and depression and low-level social support were found to be associated with the development of anxiety symptoms, whereas exercise had a protective effect on it. Group-oriented personality, presence of anxiety, no suggestion from husband, low- and moderate-level family care, and low-level social support were risk factors for prenatal depression. Limitations: All participants were recruited from one region of China, and none of them have a history of cesarean section.

Various vulnerability and risk factors have been identified, including mode of birth and support during birth. However, little research has looked at the role of adult attachment style in how women respond to events during birth. This study prospectively examined the interaction between attachment style, mode of birth, and support in determining PTSD symptoms after birth. Method: A longitudinal study of women (n = 57) from the last trimester of pregnancy to three months postpartum. Women completed questionnaire measures of attachment style in pregnancy and measures of PTSD, support during birth, and mode of birth at three months postpartum. Results: Avoidant attachment style, operative birth (assisted vaginal or caesarean section) and poor support during birth were all significantly correlated with postnatal PTSD symptoms. Regression analyses showed that avoidant attachment style moderated the relationship between operative birth and PTSD symptoms, where women with avoidant attachment style who had operative deliveries were most at risk of PTSD symptoms. Limitations: The study was limited to white European, cohabiting, primiparous women. Future research is needed to see if these findings are replicated in larger samples and different sociodemographic groups. Conclusions: This study suggests avoidant attachment style may be a vulnerability factor for postpartum PTSD, particularly for women who have operative births. If replicated, clinical implications include the potential to screen for attachment style during pregnancy and tailor care during birth accordingly.

Methods: Participants' weight and height measurements were obtained using the EPITeen cohort protocol at 13, 17 and 21 years of age, and extracted from child health books as recorded during health routine evaluations since birth. Blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were assessed at 21 years. Trajectories were defined using 719 participants contributing 11 459 measurements. The individual growth curves were modelled using mixed-effects fractional polynomial, and the trajectories were estimated using normal mixture modelling for model-based clustering. Differences in cardiometabolic risk factors at 21 years according to adiposity trajectories were estimated through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and adjusted means are presented. Results: Two trajectories--'Average body mass index (BMI) growth' (80.7%) and 'Higher BMI growth' (19.3%)--were identified. Compared with those in 'Average BMI growth', 'Higher BMI growth' participants were more frequently delivered by caesarean section, mothers were younger and had higher BMI, and parental education was lower; and at 21 years showed higher adjusted mean systolic (111.6 vs 108.3mmHg, P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (71.9 vs 68.4mmHg, P < 0.001), and lower highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (53.3 vs 57.0 mg dl-1, P = 0.001). As there was a significant interaction between trajectories and sex, triglycerides and HOMA-IR were stratified by sex and we found significantly higher triglycerides, in males, and higher HOMA-IR in both sexes in 'Higher BMI growth' trajectory. All the differences were attenuated after adjustment for BMI at 21 years. Conclusions: In this long-term follow-up, we were able to identify two adiposity trajectories, statistically related to the BMI and cardiometabolic profile in adulthood. Our results also suggest that the impact of the adiposity trajectory on cardiometabolic profile is mediated by current BMI.

The aim of this study was to analyse how pain after CS interferes with patients' activities and to identify possible causes of insufficient pain treatment. Methods: We analysed pain scores, pain-related interferences (with movement, deep breathing, mood and sleep), analgesic techniques, analgesic consumption, adverse effects and the wish to have received more analgesics during the first 24 h after surgery. To better evaluate the severity of impairment by pain, the results of CS patients were compared with those of patients undergoing hysterectomy. Results: CS patients (n = 811) were compared with patients undergoing abdominal, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal or vaginal hysterectomy (n = 2406, from 54 hospitals). Pain intensity, wish for more analgesics and most interference outcomes were significantly worse after CS compared with hysterectomies. CS patients with spinal or general anaesthesia and without patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) received significantly less opioids on the ward (62% without any opioid) compared with patients with PCA (p < 0.001). Patients with PCA reported pain-related interference with movement and deep breathing between 49% and 52% compared with patients without PCA (between 68% and 73%; p-values between 0.004 and 0.013; not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing). Conclusion: In daily clinical practice, pain after CS is much higher than previously thought. Pain management was insufficient compared with patients undergoing hysterectomy. Unfavourable outcome was mainly associated with low opioid administration after CS. Contradictory pain treatment guidelines for patients undergoing CS and for breastfeeding mothers might contribute to reluctance of opioid administration in CS patients.

Fear of childbirth is very common among women and has negative effects on the birth process and neonatal outcomes. The study was designed as quasi-experimental/non-randomised/quantitative and prospective. Primiparous women presenting to the antenatal clinic of a hospital between 27.2.2015 and 01.03.2016 constituted the study population (reached 149 women). The study sample included 108 women, 54 of whom were in the experimental group and 54 of whom were in the control group. The sample had agreed to participate in the study and had met the sample criteria. In collecting the data, the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire Version A, the birth outcomes data collection form were used. The data were analyzed using means calculation, Fisher's Exact Test, Pearson's Chi Square Test and T Test. The study found that the experimental group had a moderate level of childbirth fear prior to the training and a low level of childbirth fear following the training (p < 0.05). The study was determined that the experimental group, as compared to the control group, was positively affected by the training, in terms of childbirth fear, mode of the birth, planned or unplanned cesarean birth, the Apgar score and body weight of the newborn, and problems in the development of the newborn, the first contact time with newborn, and the first time breastfeeding (p < 0.05). The childbirth preparation program had a positive effect on fear of childbirth and neonatal outcomes.

We examined the association between maternal education, newborn feeding in hospital, and long-term breastfeeding duration. Methods We studied 3195 Canadian mother-infant dyads in the CHILD pregnancy cohort. Newborn feeding was documented from hospital records. Caregivers reported sociodemographic factors and infant feeding at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Results: Overall, 97% of newborns initiated breastfeeding and 74% were exclusively breastfed in hospital. Exclusively breastfed newborns were ultimately breastfed longer compared with those who received formula supplementation during their hospital stay (median 11.0 vs 7.0 months, P < .001). After controlling for maternal age, ethnicity, birth mode, and gestational age, exclusively breastfed newborns had a 21% reduced risk of breastfeeding cessation (HR = 0.79, 0.71-0.87). This effect was strongest among women without a postsecondary education (HR = 0.65, 0.53-0.79). Discussion: Exclusive breastfeeding in hospital is associated with longer breastfeeding duration, particularly among women of lower socioeconomic status. Initiatives that support exclusive breastfeeding of newborns in hospital could improve long-term breastfeeding rates and help reduce health inequities arising in early life.

Methods: A retrospective study was performed involving 34 infants born at 23 weeks and 91 infants born at 24-26 weeks. Indications necessitating delivery were severe pregnancy induced hypertension, non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns (NRFHRs), or intrauterine infection (IUI). Obstetrical indication for CS included NRFHR and breech presentation. Poor outcome included neonatal death or cerebral palsy. Univariate and multiple logistic analyses were performed to determine the effect of CS for obstetrical indications on poor outcome. Results: The incidence of poor outcome was significantly higher at 23 weeks (number of poor outcomes/total number: 22/34) compared to that (31/91) at 24-26 weeks (p < 0.01). The incidence of a poor outcome was significantly higher at 23 weeks for infants having NRFHR (11/16) compared to those at 24-26 weeks (15/43, p = 0.02). However, the incidence of a poor outcome was similar in infants with IUI (6/10 at 23 weeks versus 5/11 at 24-26 weeks, p = 0.41). Vaginal birth in cases of obstetrical indication for CS at 23 weeks was associated with higher risk of a poor outcome(odds ratio: 8.2). In contrast, the risk at 24-26 weeks was not higher (OR, 0.8). After adjustment using variables of vaginal birth and IUI, vaginal birth significantly affected poor outcome (OR, 13.0). Conclusion: Poor neonatal outcome was closely related to the mode of delivery, suggesting that CS for obstetrical indication at 23 weeks may improve neonatal outcome.

Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted, interviewing 314 pregnant women selected by multistage sampling technique from among those attending antenatal clinics. Information was collected using structured questionnaire and a screening tool, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), to assess probable depression. Results: The prevalence of antenatal depression was 24.5%. There were significant associations between antenatal depression and attending public health facility (P = 0.000), young maternal age (P = 0.012), single marital status (P = 0.010), not having formal education (P = 0.022), large family size (P = 0.029), planned pregnancy (P = 0.014), coexisting medical conditions (P = 0.034), history of previous caesarian section (P = 0.032), drinking alcohol during pregnancy (P = 0.004), and gender based abuse (P = 0.001). On health seeking behaviour for antenatal depression among depressed pregnant women, most, 68.9%, consulted their husbands about their symptoms; 57.3% took the decision to get treatment from doctors, and 52% sought prayer in the church. Conclusion: Antenatal depression is prevalent in this study population. Interventions to address its risk factors should be carried out and physicians should suspect depression in pregnant women reporting alcohol use and gender abuse.

Methods: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study using the United States' Health Care Cost and Utilization Project's Nationwide Inpatient Sample to evaluate maternal outcomes in women with advanced maternal age delivering from 2003 to 2012. Healthy women who underwent primary elective cesarean section constituted a surrogate for low-risk planned cesarean delivery. Logistic regression was used to compare outcomes between women with planned cesarean and planned vaginal delivery. Results: Among seven million births, we identified 442,067 deliveries in healthy women with advanced maternal age. The planned cesarean group comprised 7.96 % of women in the cohort. When compared to healthy women in the planned vaginal group, women in the planned cesarean group had a significantly higher mortality ratio (2.56/10,000 vs. 0.44/10,000, p < 0.01). The planned cesarean group was also at higher odds of numerous complications, including peripartum hysterectomy OR 1.81 (1.36-2.40), p < 0.01, cardiac arrest OR 5.39 (4.54-6.38), p < 0.01, acute renal failure OR 3.39 (1.78-6.46), p < 0.01 and sepsis OR 2.27 (1.25-4.14), p < 0.01. Conclusions for Practice: Planned cesarean section is a key factor significantly influencing maternal morbidity and mortality in healthy women with advanced maternal age. When possible, planned cesarean deliveries should be avoided in this population.

There is uncertainty how to counsel women with a previous CAD regarding the risk of CAD recurrence during pregnancy and the puerperium. Methods: In an observational study of four stroke centers, all women aged 16-45 years with primary CAD in the previous decade were asked to participate in a standardized assessment on long-term follow-up with a special focus on pregnancies and recurrent CAD. Results: Ninety-two women were identified and 53 of them were included in the analysis (60%). Eleven women declined to participate, 28 were untraceable. The 39 non-participants did not differ from participants regarding key baseline characteristics. Average follow-up time was 72 months. Nine women (17%) had recurrent CAD after a median of 14 days (range 2 days to 117 months). Eleven women (20%) had a total of 13 completed pregnancies at a median of 44 months (range 12-84 months) after index CAD. Two of the pregnant women (18%) had suffered recurrent CAD >= 18 months prior to the pregnancy. All 13 pregnancies and puerperia went without recurrent CADs or cerebrovascular events. This includes giving birth by vaginal delivery (n = 6) and caesarean section (n = 7). None of the five women with typical connective tissue disease became pregnant. Conclusions: Our observation suggests that the risk of recurrent CAD may not be greatly increased with pregnancies starting at least 12 months after CAD in women without typical connective tissue disease.

Although research to date has identified attachment style and trauma history as individual risk factors, they have yet to be examined as integrative processes in the development and maintenance of childbirth-related post-traumatic stress. The current investigation aimed to examine whether attachment style may moderate the impact of a history of interpersonal trauma on initial levels and the rate of change in post-traumatic stress symptomatology across the first 6 months of the postpartum period. A large community sample of women were recruited from two Canadian urban hospitals. Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed longitudinally at 5 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months postpartum. Latent growth curve modeling (n = 251) revealed that attachment style moderated the impact of a history of interpersonal trauma on initial levels and the rate of change in post-traumatic stress symptomatology, while controlling for other well-established psychosocial (e.g., trait anxiety, previous psychopathology, lack of perceived support) and childbirth-related (e.g., mode of birth, labor pain, subjective experience) risk factors. More secure attachment conferred resiliency and more fearful attachment conferred vulnerability among women without a history of interpersonal trauma, while more preoccupied and more dismissing attachment conferred resiliency among women with a history of interpersonal trauma. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the integrative processes among risk and protective factors underlying the development of and ability to cope with childbirth-related post-traumatic stress. Attachment style and trauma history, which can be quickly measured, should be considered as targets in antenatal screening.

Further, while it is known that women with disabilities are at increased risk of cesarean delivery, temporal trends in cesarean deliveries among women with disabilities have not been examined. Objective: To assess time trends in births by any mode and in primary cesarean deliveries among women with physical, sensory, or intellectual/developmental disabilities. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked vital records and hospital discharge data from all deliveries in California, 2000-2010 (n = 4,605,061). We identified women with potential disabilities using ICD-9 codes. We used descriptive statistics and visualizations to examine time patterns. Logistic regression analyses assessed the association between disability and primary cesarean delivery, stratified by year. Results: Among all women giving birth, the proportion with a disability increased from 0.27% in 2000 to 0.80% in 2010. Women with disabilities had significantly elevated odds of primary cesarean delivery in each year, but the magnitude of the odds ratio decreased over time from 2.60 (95% CI = 2.25 = 2.99) in 2000 to 1.66 (95% CI = 1.51-1.81) in 2010. Conclusion: Adequate clinician training is needed to address the perinatal care needs of the increasing numbers of women with disabilities giving birth. Continued efforts to understand cesarean delivery patterns and reasons for cesarean deliveries may help guide further reductions in proportions of cesarean deliveries among women with disabilities relative to women without disabilities.

Methods: Population-based record linkage cohort study was conducted among 153 730 live-born infants of >=32 weeks' gestation with developmental assessments at school age, in New South Wales, Australia, 2002 to 2007. Children were assessed in 5 domains: physical health and well-being, language and cognition, social competence, emotional maturity, and general knowledge and communication. Children scoring in the bottom 10% of national domains were considered developmentally vulnerable, and children developmentally vulnerable for >=2 domains were classified as developmentally high risk (DHR), the primary outcome. Robust multivariable Poisson models were used to obtain individual and combined adjusted relative risks (aRRs) of gestational age and mode of birth for DHR children. Results: Overall, 9.6% of children were DHR. The aRR (95% confidence interval) of being DHR increased with decreasing gestational age (referent: 40 weeks); 32 to 33 weeks 1.25 (1.08-1.44), 34 to 36 weeks 1.26 (1.18-1.34), 37 weeks 1.17 (1.10-1.25), 38 weeks 1.06 (1.01-1.10), 39 weeks 0.98 (0.94-1.02), >=41 weeks 0.99 (0.94-1.03), and for labor induction or prelabor cesarean delivery (planned birth; referent: vaginal birth after spontaneous labor), 1.07 (1.04-1.11). The combined aRR for planned birth was 1.26 (1.18-1.34) at 37 weeks and 1.13 (1.08-1.19) at 38 weeks. Conclusions: Early (at <39 weeks) planned birth is associated with an elevated risk of poor child development at school age. The timing of planned birth is modifiable, and strategies to inform more judicious decision-making are needed to ensure optimal child health and development.

acceptabilityandaccessibilityofchildnutritioninterventions:fathers'perspectivesfromsurveyandinterviewstudies;2018;jansen,acceptability and accessibility of child nutrition interventions: fathers' perspectives from survey and interview studies,2018.0,"Jansen, Elena;Harris, Holly;Daniels, Lynne;Thorpe, Karen;Rossi, Tony","Background: Against a background of changing family structures and socioeconomic demands in contemporary families, fathers are more actively engaged in meal preparation and feeding of their children, yet in research studies targeting improvement in nutrition and feeding practices fathers are under-represented. Among possible explanations for this bias are acceptability of research projects and accessibility to male research participants. The aims of this study were to identify (i) fathers' preferences for participation in child nutrition research and interventions and (ii) the potential to recruit fathers through their workplaces with the possibility of delivering interventions through those workplaces. Methods: This paper draws on two independent yet linked studies that explored fathers' roles in family feeding, and intervention studies aimed at supporting father's dietary knowledge and feeding practices. For Study 1 (conducted first) secondary data analysis was conducted on survey data (n = 463 fathers of preschool children) to determine preferences related to type of program, delivery mode, and location and timing. For Study 2 six focus groups and one individual interview were conducted with n = 28 fathers to determine acceptability of recruitment of fathers working in traditionally blue-collar occupations and service industries (as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics) and potential of intervention delivery through their workplaces. Results: Fathers were engaged in child feeding and indeed sought nutrition-related information. Fathers indicated a preference for family-focused and online delivery of interventions. Whilst potential to recruit through blue-collar workplaces was evident, participants were divided in their views about the acceptability of interventions conducted through the workplace. There was a sense of support for the logic of such interventions but the focus group participants in this study showed only modest enthusiasm for the idea. Conclusions: With limited support for the workplace as an intervention setting, further systematic exploration of technology-based intervention design and engagement is warranted. Based on findings, interventions should target a) content that is focused on the family and how to make changes at the family level, rather than the father individually; and b) online delivery, such as Apps or online video chat sessions, for convenience and to facilitate sharing of information with family members.

This research aimed to compare intended and actual VBAC rates before and after implementation of midwife-led antenatal care for women with one previous cesarean birth and no other risk factors in a large, tertiary maternity hospital in England. Methods: This was a retrospective, comparative cohort study. Data were collected from the medical records of women with one previous lower segment cesarean delivery and no other obstetric, medical, or psychological complications who gave birth at the hospital before (2008) and after (2011) the implementation of midwife-led antenatal care. Chi-squared analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio, and logistic regression to account for confounders. Results: Intended and actual VBAC rates were higher in 2011 compared with 2008: 90 percent vs. 77 percent, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.69 (1.48-4.87); and 61 percent vs. 47 percent, aOR 1.79 (1.17-2.75), respectively.

Methods: Although methadone maintenance has been the standard for the treatment of opioid dependence in pregnancy, there is no consensus on proper dosing. Single daily dosing is the most common strategy. Because of accelerated metabolism of methadone in pregnancy, this regimen may expose mother and fetus to daily episodes of withdrawal and possibly contribute to more severe Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). This study reports on a protocol that increased both methadone dose and dose frequency in response to maternal reports of withdrawal. Results: Treatment of NAS was needed in 29% of neonates, compared to a published rate of 60% to 80%. The mean methadone dose was 152 mg at delivery, divided into 2 to 6 doses per day. Ninety-two percent of mothers were free of illicit drug use at delivery. There was no relationship between methadone dose and treatment of NAS. Female babies had a treatment rate of 16% versus 38% for male babies. Beyond abstinence symptoms, cohort outcomes in terms of gestational age, birth weight, prematurity, Caesarian sections, and breastfeeding equaled or approximated US population norms. Conclusions: The protocol was associated with low-rates of treatment of NAS and high rates of maternal recovery. High rates of treatment for NAS reported inmethadone-exposed neonatesmight relate in part to iatrogenic factors and be reduced through the use of divided daily doses and protocols that minimize maternal withdrawal.

Previous reports were based on small, retrospective, specialist clinic-based studies that were unable to rigorously control for unmeasured environmental and genetic confounding. Objective: To prospectively investigate a wide range of potential perinatal risk factors for OCD, controlling for unmeasured factors shared between siblings in the analyses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based birth cohort study included all 2421284 children from singleton births in Sweden from January 1, 1973, to December 31, 1996, who were followed up through December 31, 2013. From the 1403651 families in the cohort, differentially exposed siblings from the 743885 families with siblings were evaluated; of these, 11592 families included clusters of full siblings that were discordant for OCD. Analysis of the data was conducted from January, 26, 2015, to September, 5, 2016. Exposures: Perinatal data were collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and included maternal smoking during pregnancy, labor presentation, obstetric delivery, gestational age (for preterm birth), birth weight, birth weight in relation to gestational age, 5-minute Apgar score, and head circumference. Main Outcomes and Measures: Previously validated OCD codes (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, Tenth Revision, code F42) in the Swedish National Patient Register. Results: Of 2421284 individuals included in the cohort, 17305 persons were diagnosed with OCD. Of these, 7111 were men (41.1%). The mean (SD) age of individuals at first diagnosis of OCD was 23.4 (6.5) years. An increased risk for OCD remained after controlling for shared familial confounders and measured covariates (including sex, year of birth, maternal and paternal age at birth, and parity), for smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day during pregnancy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.58), breech presentation (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.71), delivery by cesarean section (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34), preterm birth (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43), birth weight 1501 to 2500 g (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.62) and 2501 to 3500 g (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16), being large for gestational age (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.45), and Apgar distress scores at 5 minutes (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07-2.09). Gestational age and birth weight followed inverse dose-response associations, whereby an increasingly higher risk for OCD was noted in children with a shorter gestational age and lower birth weight. We also observed a dose-response association between the number of perinatal events and increased OCD risk, with HRs ranging from 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) for 1 event to 1.51 (95% CI, 1.18-1.94) for 5 or more events. Conclusions and Relevance: A range of perinatal risk factors is associated with a higher risk for OCD independent of shared familial confounders, suggesting that perinatal risk factors may be in the causal pathway to OCD.

"birthoutcomesforwomenusingfree-standingbirthcentersinsouthauckland,newzealand;2017;bailey","birth outcomes for women using free-standing birth centers in south auckland, new zealand",2017.0,"Bailey, David, John","Background: This study investigates maternal and perinatal outcomes for women with low-risk pregnancies laboring in free-standing birth centers compared with laboring in a hospital maternity unit in a large New Zealand health district. Methods: The study used observational data from 47 381 births to women with low-risk pregnancies in South Auckland maternity facilities 2003-2010. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for instrumental delivery, cesarean section, blood transfusion, neonatal unit admission, and perinatal mortality. Results: Labor in birth centers was associated with significantly lower rates of instrumental delivery, cesarean section and blood transfusion compared with labor in hospital. Neonatal unit admission rates were lower for infants of nulliparous women laboring in birth centers. Intrapartum and neonatal mortality rates for birth centers were low and were not significantly different from the hospital population. Transfers to hospital for labor and postnatal complications occurred in 39% of nulliparous and 9% of multiparous labors. Risk factors identified for transfer were nulliparity, advanced maternal age, and prolonged pregnancy >= 41 weeks' gestation. Conclusions: Labor in South Auckland free-standing birth centers was associated with significantly lower maternal intervention and complication rates than labor in the hospital maternity unit and was not associated with increased perinatal morbidity.

Objectives: To investigate associations between epilepsy in pregnancy and risks of pregnancy and perinatal outcomes as well as whether use of AEDs influenced risks. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based cohort study was conducted on all singleton births at 22 or more completed gestational weeks in Sweden from 1997 through 2011; of these, 1 424 279 were included in the sample. Information on AED exposure was available in the subset of offspring from July 1, 2005, to December 31, 2011. Data analysis was performed from October 1, 2016, to February 15, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pregnancy, delivery, and perinatal outcomes. Multivariable Poisson log-linear regression was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95%CIs, after adjusting for maternal age, country of origin, educational level, cohabitation with a partner, height, early pregnancy body mass index, smoking, year of delivery, maternal pregestational diabetes, hypertension, and psychiatric disorders. Results: Of the 1 429 652 births included in the sample, 5373 births were in 3586 women with epilepsy; mean (SD) age at first delivery of the epilepsy cohort was 30.54 (5.18) years. Compared with pregnancies of women without epilepsy, women with epilepsy were at increased risks of adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, including preeclampsia (aRR 1.24; 95%CI, 1.07-1.43), infection (aRR, 1.85; 95%CI, 1.43-2.29), placental abruption (aRR, 1.68; 95%CI, 1.18-2.38), induction (aRR, 1.31; 95%CI, 1.21-1.40), elective cesarean section (aRR, 1.58; 95%CI, 1.45-1.71), and emergency cesarean section (aRR, 1.09; 95%CI, 1.00-1.20). Infants of mothers with epilepsy were at increased risks of stillbirth (aRR, 1.55; 95%CI, 1.05-2.30), having both medically indicated (aRR, 1.24; 95%CI, 1.08-1.43) and spontaneous (aRR, 1.34; 95%CI, 1.20-1.53) preterm birth, being small for gestational age at birth (aRR, 1.25; 95%CI, 1.13-1.30), and having neonatal infections (aRR, 1.42; 95%CI, 1.17-1.73), any congenital malformation (aRR, 1.48; 95%CI, 1.35-1.62), major malformations (aRR, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.43-1.81), asphyxia-related complications (aRR, 1.75; 95%CI, 1.26-2.42), Apgar score of 4 to 6 at 5 minutes (aRR, 1.34; 95%CI, 1.03-1.76), Apgar score of 0 to 3 at 5 minutes (aRR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.62-3.61), neonatal hypoglycemia (aRR, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.34-1.75), and respiratory distress syndrome (aRR, 1.48; 95%CI, 1.30-1.68) compared with infants of unaffected women. In women with epilepsy, using AEDs during pregnancy did not increase the risks of pregnancy and perinatal complications, except for a higher rate of induction of labor (aRR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.10-1.55). Conclusions and Relevance: Epilepsy during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. However, AED use during pregnancy is generally not associated with adverse outcomes.

Methods: A population-based historical cohort study of 21,674 underweight women in Missouri delivering liveborn, singleton, term infants in 2002-2008 was conducted. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for gestational weight gain categories with multiple logistic regression, using the 2009 IOM recommended 28-40 pounds as the reference group. Results: Women gaining >40 pounds compared to women gaining 28-40 pounds had significantly higher odds for preeclampsia (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.56-2.42, p < 0.001), cesarean delivery (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.28-1.53, p < 0.001), large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant (aOR 2.32, 95% CI 2.00-2.70, p < 0.001), and 1 min APGAR score <4 (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01-1.83, p < 0.05) and significantly lower odds for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infant (aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.48-0.59, p < 0.001). Women gaining <28 pounds compared to women gaining 28-40 pounds had significantly higher odds for SGA infant (aOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.69-2.03, p < 0.001) and significantly lower odds for preeclampsia (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.96, p < 0.05) and LGA infant (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39-0.63, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Women gaining more than the IOM recommendation were at higher risk for many adverse outcomes, but at lower risk for SGA infants. Women gaining less than the IOM recommendation were at higher risk for SGA infants but were protective for preeclampsia and LGA infants. Prospective studies of other short- and long-term maternal/infant outcomes are needed to evaluate the efficacy of the IOM guideline.

Methods: One year retrospective study of women with one prior CD delivering at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH), Ghana. Women were categorized into three groups based on initial plan of management on admission [trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC), emergency repeat CD (EMCD) or non-emergent repeat CD (RCD)]. Characteristics and outcomes across these groups were then compared. Results: During the study period, 1247 women with one prior CD delivered at KBTH, of which 377 (30.2%) were triaged to RCD, 439 (35.2%) to EMCD and 431 (34.6%) to TOLAC. Twelve uterine ruptures and no maternal deaths occurred. Perinatal mortality was 4.2% (n = 52). Compared to the RCD group, the TOLAC group had a lower risk for maternal adverse events (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-1.0; p = 0.04) and non-significant higher risk of perinatal adverse events (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7-3.3; p = 0.25). Compared to women triaged to RCD, the EMCD group had a non-significant increase in risk of maternal adverse events (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.5; p = 0.2) and a significantly higher rate of perinatal adverse events (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.9; p = 0.01). Conclusions for Practice: Women triaged to EMCD at admission are different when compared to women allowed a TOLAC or offered a non-emergent RCD. These women bear increased rates of adverse outcomes and should be considered as a separate group for analysis in future studies conducted in similar settings.

Design: Prospective, longitudinal case series. Sample: A total of 133 women who demanded epidural anesthesia for childbirth answered the questionnaires. Methods: Anxiety state was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire. The STAI-S (anxiety state) was administered in three phases during childbirth: Phase 1 was before applying epidural anesthesia, Phase 2 was 45 min after the application of epidural anesthesia and Phase 3 was at less than 24 h after delivery. Data were collected in two general hospitals: a third-level public hospital and a well-recognized private hospital.Main outcome measures: STAI scores. Results: Anxiety state decreases significantly after applying the epidural anesthesia (Phase 2) compared to before anesthesia (Phase 1), and it remains low levels 24 h after childbirth (Phase 3). There were statistically significant differences in STAI scores between the different phases administrated (Phases 1 and 2: p < 0.001; effect size, d = 1.40; Phases 1 and 3: p < 0.001; effect size, d = 1.39). In Phase 3, women with cesarean section birth had significant differences in STAI scores relative to those with spontaneous birth (p = 0.037; d = 0.44). The type of health-care setting (public or private), the educational level and the numbers of previous births does not affect the level of anxiety state in women in any of the three phases. Conclusions: Women's anxiety decreases significantly after applying epidural anesthesia, and it remains low 24 h after delivery. Anxiety against childbirth was not influenced by the health system used by women, by the condition of primiparous or multiparous, or by the educational level. Women who received an epidural anesthesia with a cesarean section reported higher rates of anxiety state after birth.

However, this relationship remains controversial and requires further examination. The study aimed to examine the effect of cesarean birth on postpartum stress, anxiety, and depression. Methods: This nationwide population-based cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. A total of 12 619 women who underwent cesarean birth and 12 619 control women who underwent vaginal birth were matched by propensity score based on age, socioeconomic status, residential urbanicity, antepartum comorbidity, and index year of delivery. We compared the incidence of stress, anxiety, and depression during the first postpartum year between cesarean and comparison groups by calculating incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Results: The cesarean group showed a significantly higher risk for stress symptoms (IRR 1.4 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.02-1.92]), but not anxiety (IRR 1.14 [95% CI 0.95-1.38]) or depression (IRR 1.32 [95% CI 0.94-1.87]), although the IRRs were also greater than one. The cesarean group had a significantly higher risk of any of the above-listed three disorders than the comparison group (incidence 27.6 vs 23.4 per 1000 person-years; IRR 1.18 [95% CI 1.01-1.38]). Conclusions: Cesarean birth was associated with an increased risk of postpartum stress symptoms. Health professionals should avoid unnecessary cesarean birth, pay attention to women who deliver by cesarean, and intervene appropriately in an attempt to improve mental health among postpartum women.

However, diagnoses from registries may be imprecise and may not consider potential confounding factors, such as treatment with medication and maternal substance use. Objective: To determine whether panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in pregnancy, or medications used to treat these conditions, are associated with adverse maternal or neonatal pregnancy outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study conducted between July 1, 2005, and July 14, 2009, recruited women at 137 obstetric practices in Connecticut and Massachusetts before 17 weeks of pregnancy and reassessed them at 28 (+- 4) weeks of pregnancy and 8 (+- 4) weeks postpartum. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined by answers to the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Assessments also gathered information on treatment with medications and confounding factors, such as substance use, previous adverse birth outcomes, and demographic factors. Exposure: Panic disorder, GAD, or use of benzodiazepines or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Among mothers: preterm birth, cesarean delivery, and hypertensive diseases of pregnancy. Among neonates: low birth weight, use of minor respiratory interventions, and use of ventilatory support. Results: Of the 2654 women in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 31.0 [5.7] years), most were non-Hispanic white (1957 [73.7%]), 98 had panic disorder, 252 had GAD, 67 were treated with a benzodiazepine, and 293 were treated with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor during pregnancy. In adjusted models, neither panic disorder nor GAD was associated with maternal or neonatal complications of interest. Most medication exposures occurred early in pregnancy. Maternal benzodiazepine use was associated with cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.36-4.40), low birth weight (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.61-7.26), and use of ventilatory support for the newborn (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.2-6.9). Maternal serotonin reuptake inhibitor use was associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.58-5.04), preterm birth (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02-2.38), and use of minor respiratory interventions (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.39-2.37). With maternal benzodiazepine treatment, rates of ventilatory support increased by 61 of 1000 neonates and duration of gestation was shortened by 3.6 days; with maternal serotonin reuptake inhibitor use, gestation was shortened by 1.8 days, 152 of 1000 additional newborns required minor respiratory interventions, and 53 of 1000 additional women experienced hypertensive diseases of pregnancy. Conclusions and Relevance: Panic disorder and GAD do not contribute to adverse pregnancy complications. Women may require treatment with medications during pregnancy, which can shorten the duration of gestation slightly. Maternal treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor is also associated with hypertensive disease of pregnancy and cesarean delivery.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of breastfeeding discontinuation and cesarean section delivery with PPD during the first 6 months after delivery. Methods: Data were extracted from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort for 81,447 women who delivered during 2004-2013. PPD status was determined using the diagnosis code at outpatient or inpatient visit during the 6-month postpartum period. Breastfeeding discontinuation and cesarean section delivery were identified from prescription of lactation suppression drugs and diagnosis, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios. Results: Of the 81,447 women, 666 (0.82%) had PPD. PPD risk was higher in women who discontinued breastfeeding than in those who continued breastfeeding (hazard ratio = 3.23, P < 0.0001), in women with cesarean section delivery than in those with vaginal delivery (hazard ratio = 1.26, P = 0.0040), and in women with cesarean section delivery who discontinued breastfeeding than in those with vaginal delivery who continued breastfeeding (hazard ratio = 4.92, P < 0.0001). Limitations: Study limitations include low PPD incidence; use of indirect indicators for PPD, breastfeeding discontinuation, and working status, which could introduce selection bias and errors due to miscoding; and potential lack of adjustment for important confounders. Conclusions: Breastfeeding discontinuation and cesarean section delivery were associated with PPD during the 6-month postpartum period. Our results support the implementation of breastfeeding promoting policies, and PPD screening and treatment programs during the early postpartum period.

The World Health Organisation signal functions are set of key interventions that targets direct obstetric causes of maternal deaths. Seven signal functions are required for health facilities providing basic EmOC and nine for facilities providing comprehensive EmOC. Our objectives were to describe cadres of HCPs who are considered SBAs in Tanzania, the EmOC signal functions they perform and challenges associated with performance of EmOC signal functions. We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCPs offering maternity care services at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District in northern Tanzania. A questionnaire and health facility assessment forms were used to collect information from participants and health facilities. A total of 199 HCPs working at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District met the inclusion criteria. Out of 199, 158 participated, giving a response rate of 79.4 %. Ten cadres of HCPs were identified as conducting deliveries regardless of the level of health facilities. Most of the participants (81 %) considered themselves SBAs, although some were not considered SBAs by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW). Only two out of the eight facilities provided all of the required EmOC signal functions. While Assistant Medical Officers are expected to perform all the signal functions, only 38 % and 13 % had performed vacuum extraction or caesarean sections respectively. Very few registered and enrolled nurse-midwives had performed removal of retained products (22 %) or assisted vaginal delivery (24 and 11 %). Inadequate equipment and supplies, and lack of knowledge and skills in performing EmOC were two main challenges identified by health care providers in all the level of care. In the district, gaps existed between performance of EmOC signal functions by SBAs as expected by the MOHSW and the actual performance at health facilities. All basic EmOC facilities were not fully functional. Few health care providers performed all the basic EmOC signal functions. Competency-based in-service training of providers in EmOC and provision of enabling environment could improve performance of EmOC signal functions in the district.

Study design: Cross-sectional design. Methods: In total, 1300 pregnant women, aged 18-39 years, who were referred to hospitals in the Iranian cities of Miandoab and Mahabad in the province of West Azerbaijan in 2009-2010 were recruited for this study by a convenience sampling method. Participants were asked to share their experiences of IPV during pregnancy and adverse maternal outcomes. Results: Of these pregnant women, 945 (72.8%) reported that they had experienced IPV during their last pregnancy. A significant association was found between IPV and preterm labour [adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-2.03], caesarean section (adjOR 11.84, 95% CI 6.37-22.02), antenatal hospitalization (adjOR 6.34, 95% CI 3.82-10.52) and vaginal bleeding (adjOR 1.51, 95% CI 0.9-2.3). Discussion: This study demonstrated a high prevalence of IPV during pregnancy, and found that IPV was associated with adverse maternal outcomes including preterm labour, caesarean section, antenatal hospitalization and vaginal bleeding. This adds to the existing literature and can be used to inform healthcare practices in developing countries. Medical, health and surgical services for pregnant women should consider screening for IPV, and providers should be aware that IPV victims are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. Services should also develop links with the Battered Women's Movement; such programmes now exist in many countries.

Methods: Retrospective study conducted at a single teaching hospital. All pregnant women with twin gestation who delivered the first twin vaginally at more than 24 weeks between 1995 and 2015 were included. Major malformations and intrauterine deaths of one or both twins were excluded. Women were divided into those who had an inter-twin delivery interval of less than 30 minutes (group 1) or 30 minutes or more (group 2). Primary outcome was umbilical artery pH less than 7.1 and/or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes of the second twin. Generalized linear regression with log was performed to evaluate the association with delivery interval. Results: Of 88 145 deliveries during this period, 1955 (2.2%) were twins. Overall, 713 twin pregnancies, 596 (83.6%) in group 1 and 117 (16.4%) in group 2, were eligible and included. Mean inter-delivery interval was 11.0 +- 6.5 and 52.5 +- 31.5 minutes in groups 1 and 2, respectively. After adjusting for variables found significantly different between the groups in univariate analysis, inter-delivery interval of less than 30 minutes or 30 minutes or more was not a significant risk factor for pH less than 7.1 and/or Apgar less than 7 (P = .91). The cesarean rate for delivery of the second twin after vaginal delivery of the first twin was 4.3% overall, with a higher rate among group 2 compared with group 1 (18.2% and 3.2%, respectively; P = .001).

Neurotrophic factors and inflammatory processes have received particular attention in the past few years. According to the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the study sample (n = 136) consisted of three groups: mothers with major depressive disorder (MDD group, n = 25), mothers with anxiety disorder (AD group, n = 18), and mothers without any psychiatric disorders (not diagnosed (ND) group, n = 93). During the delivery/cesarean section, a blood sample was obtained from the umbilical cord. Serum concentrations of BDNF, NT-3, FGF2, TNF-a, and neopterin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), according to the manufacturer's procedure. Clinical and biochemical characteristics were assessed. We did not find a significant difference among the three study groups with regard to BDNF, NT-3, and TNF-a levels. The ANOVA test indicated statistically significant differences in FGF2 levels and neopterin between the study groups. The newborns of mothers with AD had significantly higher FGF2 levels and significantly higher neopterin levels when compared with those of mothers with MDD and healthy mothers. The present study sheds light on the effects of higher FGF2 and neopterin levels in fetuses exposed to AD.

Study design: Retrospective two-stage stratified sample design. Methods: Data were extracted from two rounds of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2004 and 2014. Concentration Index of CS utilization was calculated using the wealth quintile. Regression-based decomposition method was applied to assess the socio-economic contributors of inequality in CS utilization. Results: The rate of CS utilization increased from 4.98% in 2004 to 24.21% in 2014. The utilization of CS was highly concentrated among the women of higher socio-economic status (SES) in both rounds of the survey. Results of the decomposition models revealed wealth quintile, higher education, higher number of antenatal visits, and being overweight or obese as the critical factors contributing to the inequalities of CS utilization. Conclusion: Bangladesh is now observing a rapid rise in CS utilization and women with higher SES are the main client group of this life saving procedure. There may have inadequate access for those who are relatively less advantaged, even when CS is necessary. Strong initiative from the government is necessary to ensure proper access to this service regardless of women's SES.

Clinical data regarding the role of these pathways in acute pain is lacking. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of noradrenaline, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine in parturients with labor pain compared to those without labor pain. Methods: One hundred term uncomplicated pregnant women receiving spinal anesthesia for cesarean section were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. CSF noradrenaline, serotonin, GABA, and glycine levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Labor pain score was assessed by numerical rating scale. Results: Median CSF serotonin concentration in parturients with labor pain was significantly lower than in those without pain (p < 0.001).Median CSF glycine level in the labor pain group was significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in median CSF level of noradrenaline or GABA between parturients with and without labor pain. Subsequent analysis showed labor pain scores to be negatively correlated with CSF serotonin (r = -0.217, p = 0.04) but positively correlated with CSF glycine (r = 0.415, p < 0.001). Conclusion. CSF serotonin and glycine were significantly correlated with labor pain scores.These findings suggest that the serotonergic and glycinergic systems may play a role in spinal modulation of visceral pain.

Methods: 794 evaluable women from the Massachusetts General Hospital National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications were followed across pregnancy (N = 144 exposed to benzodiazepines and N = 650 unexposed). Data obtained through maternal report and medical records included maternal outcomes (cesarean section, preeclampsia) and neonatal outcomes (birth weight, breathing difficulty, feeding difficulty, head circumference, 5-minute Apgar score, muscular and/or extrapyramidal symptoms, NICU admission, prematurity). Results: In adjusted analyses, infants exposed to benzodiazepines in utero were more likely to be admitted to the NICU (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.66) and to have small head circumferences (OR: 3.89, 95% CI: 1.25, 12.03) compared to unexposed infants. Other neonatal adverse effects such as respiratory distress or muscular symptoms including hypotonia were not observed. There were no significant differences in adverse obstetrical outcomes. Conclusions: Infants exposed to benzodiazepines during pregnancy had an increased risk of NICU admissions and small head circumferences.

We aimed to prospectively investigate potential perinatal risk factors for TD/CTD, taking unmeasured factors shared between full siblings into account. A population-based birth cohort, consisting of all singletons born in Sweden in 1973-2003, was followed until December 2013. A total of 3 026 861 individuals were identified, 5597 of which had a registered TD/CTD diagnosis. We then studied differentially exposed full siblings from 947 942 families; of these, 3563 families included siblings that were discordant for TD/CTD. Perinatal data were collected from the Medical Birth Register and TD/CTD diagnoses were collected from the National Patient Register, using a previously validated algorithm. In the fully adjusted models, impaired fetal growth, preterm birth, breech presentation and cesarean section were associated with a higher risk of TD/CTD, largely independent from shared family confounders and measured covariates. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with risk of TD/CTD in a dose-response manner but the association was no longer statistically significant in the sibling comparison models or after the exclusion of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A dose-response relationship between the number of adverse perinatal events and increased risk for TD/CTD was also observed, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.50) for one event to 2.42 (95% CI: 1.65-3.53) for five or more events.

The objective of this study was to assess the association between fear of childbirth and cesarean delivery in North European women. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted among 6,422 pregnant women from Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway, and Sweden. Fear of childbirth was measured by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire during pregnancy and linked to obstetric information from hospital records. Results: Among 3,189 primiparous women, those reporting severe fear of childbirth were more likely to give birth by elective cesarean, (OR, 1.66 [95% CI 1.05-2.61]). Among 3,233 multiparous women, severe fear of childbirth increased the risk of elective cesarean (OR 1.87 [95% CI 1.30-2.69]). Reporting lack of positive anticipation, one of six dimensions of fear of childbirth, was most strongly associated with elective cesarean (OR 2.02 [95% CI 1.52-2.68]). A dose-effect pattern was observed between level of fear and risk of emergency cesarean in both primiparous and multiparous women. Indications for cesarean were more likely to be reported as 'nonmedical' among those with severe fear of childbirth; 16.7 versus 4.6 percent in primiparous women, and 31.7 versus 17.5 percent in multiparous women. Conclusion: Having severe fear of childbirth increases the risk of elective cesarean, especially among multiparous women. Lack of positive anticipation of the upcoming childbirth seems to be an important dimension of fear associated with cesarean delivery. Counseling for women who do not look forward to vaginal birth should be further evaluated.

The Health Belief Model and prior research suggest knowledge of health recommendations and associated risks motivate health behaviors. This study determined whether knowledge of maternal and infant obesity risks during pregnancy (ORDP) and knowledge of IOM gestational weight gain (GWG) recommendations were associated with total GWG and likelihood of adhering to IOM recommendations. Materials and Methods: In this prospective survey study, healthy women with a singleton pregnancy were recruited from prenatal clinic waiting rooms of a university medical center to complete a one-time survey of prepregnancy weight and height, demographic variables, knowledge of infant-related ORDP (e.g., large for gestational age), knowledge of maternal-related ORDP (e.g., Cesarean delivery), and knowledge of IOM GWG recommendations. Total GWG was obtained from clinic medical records. Logistic and multiple regression analyses were performed. Results: The sample consisted of 159 women with average age of 25 and prepregnancy body mass index of 28. Women in the sample were predominantly African American (57%) and from low socioeconomic conditions. Results showed (1) knowledge of GWG recommendations was inversely related to total GWG among normal and underweight women and (2) knowledge of infant-related ORDP was positively related to total GWG among overweight and obese women and the likelihood of exceeding recommendations among normal and underweight women. Knowledge of maternal-related ORDP was not related to GWG. Conclusion: As the Health Belief Model suggests, knowledge appears to be a modifiable factor in preventing excess GWG. However, there may be misinformation regarding how to adhere to clinical recommendations.

The relationship between duration of breast feeding and motor development outcomes at 10, 14, and 17 years were examined. Methods: Data were obtained from the Western Australian Pregnancy (Raine) Study. There were 2868 live births recorded and children were examined for motor proficiency at 10 (M = 10.54, SD = 2.27), 14 (M = 14.02, SD = 2.33) and 17 (M = 16.99, SD = 2.97) years using the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND). Using linear mixed models, adjusted for covariates known to affect motor development, the influence of predominant breast feeding for <6 months and >=6 months on motor development outcomes was examined. Results: Breast feeding for >=6 months was positively associated with improved motor development outcomes at 10, 14 and 17 years of age (p = 0.019, b 1.38) when adjusted for child's sex, maternal age, alcohol intake, family income, hypertensive status, gestational stress and mode of delivery.

Medical complications occurring during pregnancy and/or childbirth have been linked to postpartum psychiatric illness and sociodemographic factors. We evaluated if pregnancy and obstetrical predictors have similar effects on different types of postpartum psychiatric disorders. Method: A population-based cohort study using Danish registers was conducted in 392 458 primiparous women with a singleton delivery between 1995 and 2012 and no previous psychiatric history. The main outcome was first-onset postpartum psychiatric episodes. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for any psychiatric contact in four quarters for the first year postpartum. Results: PPD and postpartum acute stress reactions were associated with pregnancy and obstetrical complications. For PPD, hyperemesis gravidarum [IRR 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-3.73], gestational hypertension (IRR 1.84, 95% CI 1.33-2.55), pre-eclampsia (IRR 1.45, 95% CI 1.14-1.84) and Cesarean section (C-section) (IRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) were associated with increased risk. For postpartum acute stress, hyperemesis gravidarum (IRR 1.93, 95% CI 1.38-2.71), preterm birth (IRR 1.51, 95% CI 1.30-1.75), gestational diabetes (IRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.97) and C-section (IRR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.55) were associated with increased risk. In contrast, risk of PP was not associated with pregnancy or obstetrical complications. Conclusions: Pregnancy and obstetrical complications can increase the risk for PPD and acute stress reactions but not PP. Identification of postpartum women requiring secondary care is needed to develop targeted approaches for screening and treatment. Future work should focus on understanding the contributions of psychological stressors and underlying biology on the development of postpartum psychiatric illness.

This study was undertaken to assess utilization of maternal health services among Syrian refugees in both countries. Description: A cross-sectional survey of Syrian refugees living in urban and rural (non-camp) settings was conducted using a two-stage cluster survey design with probability proportional to size sampling in 2014-2015. Eighty-six percent of surveyed households in Lebanon and 88% of surveyed households in Jordan included women with a live birth in the last year. Information from women in this sub-set of households was analyzed to understand antenatal and intrapartum health service utilization. Assessment: A majority of respondents reported seeking antenatal care, 82% and 89% in Jordan and Lebanon, respectively. Women had an average of at least six antenatal care visits. Nearly all births (98% in Jordan and 94% in Lebanon) took place in a health facility. Cesarean rates were similar in both countries; approximately one-third of all births were cesarean deliveries. A substantial proportion of women incurred costs for intrapartum care; 33% of Syrian women in Jordan and 94% of Syrian women in Lebanon reported paying out of pocket for their deliveries. The proportion of women incurring costs for intrapartum care was higher in Jordan both countries for women with cesarean deliveries compared to those with vaginal deliveries; however, this difference was not statistically significant in either country (Jordan p-value = 0.203; Lebanon p-value = 0.099). Conclusion: Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon had similar levels of utilization of maternal health services, despite different health systems and humanitarian assistance provisions. As expected, a substantial proportion of households incurred out-of-pocket costs for essential maternal and newborn health services, making cost a major factor in care-seeking decisions and locations. As health financing policies shift to account for the continued burden of refugee hosting on the health system, sustained attention to the availability and quality of essential maternal and newborn health services is needed to protect both refugee and host populations women's rights to health and health care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.

There is increasing interest in adopting family-friendly or gentle protocols for women having cesarean birth. Current evidence suggests challenges in achieving interdepartmental cooperation and consensus are potential barriers to implementing gentle cesarean protocols. Purpose: To describe how care providers' professional role and characteristics may affect perception about gentle cesarean birth techniques and inform specific concerns about protocol changes. Study Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey with mixed-methods analysis incorporating quantitative and qualitative conventional content analysis was used. A structured survey was distributed via email to all care providers on the labor and birth unit, including attending physicians, resident physicians in training, fellows, labor nurses, respiratory therapists, and operating room technicians. Quantitative responses were analyzed with bivariable tests and logistic regression to describe associations between provider attitudes and provider characteristics. Open-ended responses were analyzed with conventional content analysis to develop a model describing influences on overall provider attitudes. Results: Physicians and nurses generally have positive attitudes on benefits of gentle cesarean techniques. Their perceptions overall are informed by the balance of concerns about patient safety and logistical challenges versus perceived benefits of the techniques. On an individual level, care provider demographic and professional characteristics of gender and prior experience affected attitudes more than their specific role in patient care. Clinical Implications: Most labor and birth care providers have positive attitudes about gentle cesarean birth. Implementation of such programs should prioritize patient safety, educate physician and nurses about potential benefits for patients, and use experienced physicians and nurses as ambassadors to increase acceptance.

Some studies have reported increased early parenting difficulties in women who conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF). Our study had two main objectives: (1) to determine by a retrospective chart review the demographic and medical factors associated with breastfeeding versus formula feeding in women who had undergone IVF and (2) to assess by survey study the reasons for the infant feeding decision (breastfeeding versus formula feeding) for women who conceived by IVF. Subjects and Methods: By telephone interviews, we conducted a longitudinal nonexperimental cohort study of French women who had a live birth after IVF. Fertility data and obstetric outcomes were collected from individual medical records. Results: Among women who had a live birth after IVF (n = 13), 63% (n = 46) initiated breastfeeding for a mean duration of 6.2 +- 6.2 months. In our IVF population, the breastfeeding initiation rate was similar to that in the general French population. The following three factors were found to have a significant negative influence on breastfeeding initiation: duration of infertility greater than 2 years, cesarean delivery, and history of formula feeding when the women themselves were newborns. Conclusions: Long duration of infertility and history of cesarean delivery after IVF negatively influenced the breastfeeding initiation rate. For this subgroup of patients, postpartum care should be enhanced to support the early mother-baby relationship and promote breastfeeding.

High rates of obstetric interventions and disrespectful maternity care are also common to the region. No previous study has examined the associations among informal payments, intervention rates, and quality of maternity care. Methods: We distributed an online cross-sectional survey in 2014 to a nationally representative sample of Hungarian internet-using women (N = 600) who had given birth in the last 5 years. The survey included items related to socio-demographics, type of provider, obstetric interventions, and experiences of care. Women reported if they paid informally, and how much. We built a two-part model, where a bivariate probit model was used to estimate conditional probabilities of women paying informally, and a GLM model to explore the amount of payments. We calculated marginal effects of the covariates (provider choice, interventions, respectful care). Results: Many more women (79%) with a chosen doctor paid informally (191 euros on average) compared to 17% of women without a chosen doctor (86 euros). Based on regression analysis, the chosen doctor's presence at birth was the principal determinant of payment. Intervention and procedure rates were significantly higher for women with a chosen doctor versus without (cesareans 45% vs. 33%; inductions 32% vs. 19%; episiotomy 75% vs. 62%; epidural 13% vs. 5%), but had no direct effect on payments. Half of the sample (42% with a chosen doctor, 62% without) reported some form of disrespectful care, but this did not reduce payments. Conclusion: Despite reporting disrespect and higher rates of interventions, women rewarded the presence of a chosen doctor with informal payments. They may be unaware of evidence-based standards, and trust that their chosen doctor provided high quality maternity care.

Design: This cross-sectional study interviewed participants at the time of routine obstetric ultrasounds at three institutions in Santiago Atitlan and one institution in San Lucas Toliman. Data were collected from January 2010 to May 2013. Data entry and statistical analysis were performed using EPI InfoTM 7.1.2.0 (CDC). Results: The two populations were similar in maternal age, BMI, ownership of a phone, gravidity (number of times a women has been pregnant), history of spontaneous abortions, history of term pregnancies, newborn birth weights, cesarean section rate, and percentage of low-birth-weight newborns (LBW < 2500 g). Obesity was present in 22% of the combined surveyed populations. Lowbirth- weight newborns and newborn macrosomia (newborn birth weight greater than 4000 g) were present in 5.5% and 3.7%, respectively. The newborn gender ratio (male to female) was equal to 0.92. The two populations differed in ownership of gas stoves and percentage of newborn macrosomia. Significant associations included: (1) female newborn gender and low birth weight, (2) obesity and newborn macrosomia, and (3) obesity and male gender. Conclusion: The two Mayan populations were similar in many of the obstetric variables. The percentage of low-birth-weight infants (5.5%) is considerably lower than reported prevalence data for Guatemala. The obstetric characteristics, differences, and similarities between these two Mayan populations should help in policy planning for obstetric care for these two populations and possibly other indigenous populations in Guatemala.

Design: Quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive design. Setting: Rural southern California communities. Participants: A convenience sample of 223 Hispanic women, ages 18 to 42 years old, with one living infant younger than 12 months old. Methods: Interviewer-administered Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and sociodemographic and obstetric history survey (maternal age, marital status, education, annual household income, employment, sex of infant, birth type, and number of children). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to determine associations and predictive relationships among sociodemographic and obstetric factors and symptoms of PPD. Results: Low education levels, unemployment, cesarean birth, and more than one young child were significantly related to PPD risk (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores >= 10). Many of the factors associated with PPD symptoms in this sample of Hispanic women were similar to those previously reported in the literature.

Women enrolled prior to 20-week gestation in a prospective, observational study. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was completed to obtain lifetime Axis I diagnoses. A total of 56 women with OCD were followed at 1 to 3-month intervals through 52 weeks postpartum. Each visit, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), clinical assessment, and medication/exposure tracking were performed. Obstetric and neonatal data were abstracted from the medical record. In subjects with OCD, associations between perinatal obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCSs) and outcomes were examined. Additionally, outcomes were compared to 156 matched psychiatric patients without OCD. Maternal age inversely correlated with the YBOCS scores across the study period (b = -0.5161, p = .0378). Cesarean section was associated with increased OCSs in the postpartum period compared to vaginal delivery (b = 5.3632, p = 0.043). No associations were found between severity of perinatal obsessions or compulsions and any specific obstetric or neonatal complications. Subjects without OCD had higher frequency of fetal loss compared to mothers with OCD (kh2 = 4.03, p = 0.043). These novel prospective data fail to identify an association of OCSs with adverse outcomes. In contrast, there is an association of delivery method and younger maternal age with increased postnatal symptoms of OCD. Psychiatric subjects without OCD may have a higher risk of miscarriage and intrauterine fetal demise compared to subjects with OCD.

Method: This was a population-based prospective birth cohort study using national register data. The sampling frame included 845,345 offspring, representing all singleton live births in Finland between 1996 and 2010. Pregnancies were classified as exposed to SSRIs (N=15,729), unexposed to SSRIs but with psychiatric diagnoses (N=9,652), and unexposed to medications and psychiatric diagnoses (N=31,394). Pregnancy outcomes in SSRI users were compared with those in the unexposed groups. Results: Offspring of mothers who received SSRI prescriptions during pregnancy had a lower risk for late preterm birth (odds ratio=0.84, 95% CI=0.74-0.96), for very preterm birth (odds ratio=0.52, 95% CI=0.37-0.74), and for cesarean section (odds ratio=0.70, 95% CI=0.6620.75) compared with offspring of mothers unexposed to medications but with psychiatric disorders. In contrast, in SSRI-treated mothers, the risk was higher for offspring neonatal complications, including low Apgar score (odds ratio=1.68, 95% CI=1.34-2.12) and monitoring in a neonatal care unit (odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI=1.14-1.35). Compared with offspring of unexposed mothers, offspring of SSRI-treated mothers and mothers unexposed to medications but with psychiatric disorders were both at increased risk of many adverse pregnancy outcomes, including cesarean section and need for monitoring in a neonatal care unit. Conclusions: In a large national birth cohort, treatment of maternal psychiatric disorders with SSRIs during pregnancy was related to a lower risk of preterm birth and cesarean section but a higher risk of neonatal maladaptation. The findings provide novel evidence for a protective role of SSRIs on some deleterious reproductive outcomes, possibly by reducing maternal depressive symptoms. The divergent findings suggest that clinical decisions on SSRI use during pregnancy should be individualized, taking into account the mother's psychiatric and reproductive history.

This study aims to identify the risk factors of postpartum depression. Our primary focus is on obstetric risk factors. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study which we extracted the data of women who gave birth between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2012 from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment service (HIRA) database. We analyzed the data using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: A total of 17,483 (1.4%) women suffered from depression during the postpartum period. Younger (< 20years) and advanced maternal age (>= 35years), primiparity, previous depression, peripartum hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, preterm delivery, placental abruption, cesarean delivery, induced labor, and preeclampsia were found to increase the likelihood of having depression after delivery. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are several risk factors that lead women to postpartum depression. Therefore, early detection and well-management of the symptoms and risk factors for postpartum depression along with social support can help both physical and psychological conditions of women after childbirth.

The unexpected loss of the CFM system at a tertiary unit provided a unique opportunity to evaluate outcomes and staff attitudes toward CFM. Methods: This retrospective cohort study compared patient data from 2,855 electronically monitored women delivering over a 12-month period, where CFM was available for the first 6 months but unavailable for the following 6 months. Primary outcomes relating to neonatal morbidity and secondary outcomes relating to intrapartum interventions were examined. Additionally, birth unit staff members were surveyed about aspects of care related to CFM. Results: There were no significant differences in perinatal outcomes between the cohorts. While unadjusted analysis suggested a lower spontaneous vaginal birth rate (55.4% vs 60.3%) and a higher cesarean delivery rate (25.1% vs 22.0%, p = 0.026), together with higher epidural (53.0% vs 49.2%, p = 0.04) and fetal blood sampling (11.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.03) rates in the presence of CFM, these differences were lost when adjusted for prostaglandin ripening. Over half of the staff (56.0% of midwives, 54.0% of obstetricians) reported spending more time with the laboring woman in the period without CFM. Conclusions: This single institution's experience indicates that in birth units staffed for one-to-one care in labor, central fetal monitoring does not appear to be associated with either a benefit on perinatal outcomes or an increase in cesarean delivery and other interventions. However, it is associated with a reduction in the time a midwife spends with the laboring woman.

Several studies have identified multiple obesity-associated loci in many populations. However, their contribution to obesity in the Vietnamese population is not fully described, especially in children. The study aimed to investigate the association of obesity with Val66Met polymorphism in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, delivery method, birth weight, and lifestyle factors in Vietnamese primary school children. Methods: A case-control study was conducted on 559 children aged 6-11 years (278 obese cases and 281 normal controls). The obesity of the children was classified using both criteria of International Obesity Task Force (IOTF, 2000) and World Health Organization (WHO, 2007). Lifestyle factors, birth delivery, and birth weight of the children were self-reported by parents. The BDNF genotype was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Association was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression and cross-validated by the Bayesian model averaging method. Results: The most significantly independent factors for obesity were delivery method (cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery, b = 0.56, p = 0.007), birth weight (> 3500 to < 4000 g vs. 2500-3500 g, b = 0.52, p = 0.035; >= 4000 g vs. 2500-3500 g, b = 1.06, p = 0.015), night sleep duration (< 8 h/day vs. >= 8 h/day, b = 0.99, p < 0.0001), and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (AA and GG vs. AG, b = 0.38, p = 0.039).

Evidence suggests an increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality among women with epilepsy. However, these risks have not been quantified in large population-based samples. Objective: To report on the risk for death and adverse outcomes at the time of delivery for women with epilepsy in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of pregnant women identified through delivery hospitalization records from the 2007-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. From this representative sample of 20% of all US hospitals, we obtained a weighted sample of delivery hospitalizations from 69 385 women with epilepsy and 20 449 532 women without epilepsy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Obstetrical outcomes including maternal death, cesarean delivery, length of stay, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and stillbirth. Results: Women with epilepsy had a risk of death during delivery hospitalization of 80 deaths per 100 000 pregnancies, significantly higher than the 6 deaths per 100 000 pregnancies found among women without epilepsy (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 11.46 [95% CI, 8.64-15.19]). Women with epilepsy were also at a heightened risk for other adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia (adjusted OR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.54-1.63]), preterm labor (adjusted OR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.50-1.57]), and stillbirth (adjusted OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.17-1.38]), and had increased health care utilization, including an increased risk of cesarean delivery (adjusted OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.38-1.42]) and prolonged length of hospital stay (>6 days) among both women with cesarean deliveries (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 2.03-2.23]) and women with vaginal deliveries (adjusted OR, 2.60 [95% CI, 2.41-2.80]). Conclusions and Relevance: Findings suggest that women with epilepsy are at considerably heightened risk for many adverse outcomes during their delivery hospitalization, including a more than 10-fold increased risk of death, and that increased clinical attention is imperative for these pregnancies.

We aimed to identify factors associated with psychological distress, a proxy for common mental disorders, among mothers in rural Dhanusha, Nepal. Methods: We used data from 9078 mothers who were screened for distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) around six weeks after delivery. We assessed the association between GHQ-12 score and socioeconomic, gender-based, cultural and reproductive health factors using a hierarchical analytical framework and multilevel linear regression models. Results: Using a threshold GHQ-12 score of >= 6 to indicate caseness, the prevalence of distress was 9.8% (886/9078). Factors that predicted distress were severe food insecurity (b 2.21 (95% confidence interval 1.43, 3.40)), having a multiple birth (2.28 (1.27, 4.10)), caesarean section (1.70 (0.29, 2.24)), perinatal health problems (1.58 (1.23, 2.02)), no schooling (1.37 (1.08, 1.73)), fewer assets (1.33 (1.10, 1.60)), five or more children (1.33 (1.09, 1.61)), poor or no antenatal care (1.31 (1.15, 1.48) p < 0.001), having never had a son (1.31 (1.14, 1.49)), not staying in the parental home in the postnatal period (1.15 (1.02, 1.30)), having a husband with no schooling (1.17 (0.96, 1.43)) and lower maternal age (0.99 (0.97, 1.00)). Limitations: The study was cross-sectional and we were therefore unable to infer causality. Because data were not collected for some established predictors, including infant death, domestic violence and history of mental illness, we could not assess their associations with distress. Conclusions: Socioeconomic disadvantage, gender inequality and poor reproductive health predict distress among mothers in Dhanusha. Maternal and child health programmes, as well as poverty alleviation and educational interventions, may be beneficial for maternal mental health.

Methods: Retrospective cohort study comparing 222 VAMA primiparae and a reference group of 222 primiparae aged 30-35, delivering at Sheba Medical Center from 2008 through 2013. Results: VAMA primiparae were more likely than younger primiparae to be single, to have chronic health conditions, and higher rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational-hypertension (GHTN) and preeclampsia-eclampsia. VAMA primiparae conceived mostly by oocyte donation. They were more likely to be hospitalized during pregnancy, to deliver preterm and by cesarean birth. Infants of VAMA primiparae were at greater risk for low birthweight and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission. There were no differences in outcomes between VAMA primiparae with or without preexisting chronic conditions, or between those aged 45-49 and >= 50. In multivariable analysis VAMA was an independent risk factor for GDM, GHTN and preeclamsia-eclampsia, with adjusted odds ratio of 2.38 (95 % CI 1.32, 4.29), 5.80 (95 % CI 2.66, 12.64) and 2.45 (95 % CI 1.03, 5.85); respectively. The effect of age disappeared in multiple pregnancies. Conclusions: Primiparity at VAMA holds a significant risk for adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The absence of chronic medical conditions or the use of a young oocyte donor does not improve these outcomes. Multiple pregnancies hold additional risk and may diminish the effect of age. Primiparity at an earlier age should be encouraged.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the association between DFM and pregnancy outcome in singleton gestation at term according to parity. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies at term between 2008 and 2013. Eligibility was limited to women carrying a fetus with no known structural or chromosomal anomalies, at 37 + 0/7 to 42 + 0/7 weeks of gestation. Women presenting to the delivery ward with DFM were compared with women without similar complaints. Results: Overall, 12,564 nulliparous women and 25,292 multiparous women gave birth during the study period; of them, 300 nulliparous women (2.4%) and 525 multiparous women (2.1%) complained of DFM. For nulliparous women, after adjusting for potential confounders, DFM was associated with antepartum fetal death (aOR 4.6 [95% CI 1.1-19.8]), cesarean delivery (CD) (aOR 1.3 [95% CI 1.01-1.8]), 1-minute Apgar score less than 7 (aOR 2.3 [95% CI 1.5-3.5]) and neonatal seizures (aOR 3.2 [95% CI 1.3-8.2]). For multiparous women, DFM was associated with unscheduled CD (aOR 2.7 [95% CI 1.6-4.6]) and CD indicated by intermediate/abnormal fetal heart rate tracing (aOR 4.8 [95% CI 2.8-8.4]). Conclusions: DFM carries different outcomes according to parity. Although for nulliparous women, DFM is associated with increased risk of CD and immediate adverse perinatal outcome, for multiparous women it is associated with increased risk for CD, with no immediate increased risk for adverse perinatal outcome.

However, it is unknown whether OSAS in ex-preterm children is associated with specific perinatal risk factors. This multicenter cohort study aimed to determine perinatal factors associated with OSAS at school age. Methods: 197 ex-preterm (500-1,250 g) children aged 5-12 y who participated as neonates in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of caffeine versus placebo (Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity) underwent comprehensive ambulatory polysomnography. A negative binomial regression model was used to identify perinatal risk factors associated with OSAS. Results: 19 children had OSAS (9.6%). Chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation were positively associated with OSAS with P values of 0.014 and 0.03, respectively. Maternal white race (P = 0.047) and maternal age (P = 0.002) were negatively associated with OSAS. Other risk factors, such as birth weight, Apgar score at 5 min, antenatal corticosteroids, delivery route, and sex were not significant. Conclusions: OSAS is very frequent, and is associated with chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation in ex-preterm children. Those born to older white mothers appear to be protected. We speculate that the former may be due to systemic inflammation and the latter to a higher socio-economic status.

The study sample consisted of 172 full-term infants (born during Gestational Weeks 37-42) and their mothers.

Emotional and behavioral problems at age of 1 1/2 years were more prevalent in infants born via cesarean section, as compared to infants born vaginally without administration of medication. Newborns' suboptimal functioning after birth, complicated emotional acceptance of pregnancy, a couple's nonsatisfactory relationship during pregnancy, maternal distress during pregnancy and in the first months after childbirth, and inflexible and parent-oriented attitudes toward infant-rearing also predicted children's emotional and behavioral problems independent of sociodemographic factors. Results suggest that biomedical and psychosocial factors which manifest themselves in the prenatal and perinatal periods can have associations with later infant and child mental health.

Method: This was a multidimensional retrospective cohort study. Women who gave birth at a Brazilian tertiary maternity between 2008 and 2012 were included, with data extraction from the hospital information system. Those with potentially life-threatening conditions and maternal near miss episodes (severe maternal morbidity) were considered the exposed group. The control group was a random sample of women who had had uncomplicated pregnancy. Female sexual function was evaluated through FSFI questionnaire, and general and reproductive aspects were addressed through specific questions. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney and Pearson's Chi-square for bivariate analyses. Logistic regression was used to identify variables independently associated with lower FSFI scores. Results: 638 women were included (315 at exposed and 323 at not exposed groups). The majority of women were under 30 years-old in the control group and between 30 and 46 years-old in the exposed group (p = 0.003). Women who experienced severe maternal morbidity (SMM) had statistically significant differences regarding cesarean section (82.4% versus 47.1% among deliveries without complications, p < 0.001), and some previous pathological conditions. FSFI mean scores were similar among groups ranging from 24.39 to 24.42. It took longer for exposed women to resume sexual activity after index pregnancy (mean 84 days after SMM and 65 days for control group, p = 0.01). Multiple analyses showed no significant association of FSFI below cut-off value with any predictor.Conclusion: FSFI scores were not different in both groups. However, they were lower than expected. SMM delayed resumption of sexual activity after delivery, beyond postpartum period. However, the proportion of women in both groups having sex at 3 months after delivery was similar. Altered sexual response may be evaluated as one of possible long-term consequences after SMM episodes. Further studies on the growing population of women surviving severe maternal conditions might be worth for improvement of care for women.

Results: We detected three sleep duration trajectories during pregnancy: short-decreasing (< 6.5 h/night, 10.8% of the sample), medium-decreasing (6.5-8h/night, 57.6%), and long-increasing (> 8 h/night, 31.6%) trajectories. Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13 [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working > 28 weeks of gestational age (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10-0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression coefficient/trimester = -0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration (regression coefficient/trimester = -0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e. cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion: We identified sleep trajectories among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal and child health.

Methods: This is a retrospective study of all low-risk women (term, vertex, singleton) who had a primary cesarean delivery in any Hawaii hospital from 2010 to 2011 using a statewide health information database. Hospitals were divided into two categories: rural and urban. Results: Of the 27,096 women who met criteria for this study, 7105 (26.2 %) delivered in a rural hospital. Low-risk women who delivered in a rural hospital had a primary cesarean delivery rate of 18.5 % compared to 11.8 % in the urban hospitals, p < .0001. Low-risk women who delivered at rural hospitals had significantly higher unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for cesarean delivery. The association with rural hospital was stronger after adjusting for confounders, aOR 2.47 (95 % CI 2.23-2.73) compared to unadjusted OR 1.70 (95 % CI 1.58-1.83) for primary cesarean delivery.

In patients submitted to cesarean section, this pain can also interfere with women's ability to care for their babies, to effectively breastfeed, and to satisfactorily interact with their children. Factors influencing the pain perception during the immediate postoperative period have not been widely pursued. Objective. To investigate the incidence and predicting factors of postoperative pain after cesarean section. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study with 1,062 women submitted to cesarean section. We collected sociodemographic, clinical, surgical, and health behavior data. We used the 11-point Numerical Pain and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales. We performed logistic analysis to identify predictors of moderate to severe postoperative pain. Results: The incidence of moderate-severe postoperative pain was 78.4% (CI: 95%: 75.9%-80.8%).The preoperative anxiety (OR = 1.60; CI 95%: 1.22-2.30) and intrathecalmorphine with fentanyl (OR = 0,23; CI 95%: 0.08-0.66) were significantly associated with moderate-severe postoperative pain report. Conclusion: The preoperative anxiety increases the risk of moderate-severe postoperative pain in women submitted to cesarean section. The intrathecal morphine with fentanyl added to bupivacaine was a protective factor against this pain.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intraoperative bonding (early SSC) after cesarean section on neonatal adaptation, maternal pain and stress response. Study design: This prospective, randomized-controlled pilot study was performed at a single academic tertiary hospital (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz, Austria) between September 2013 and January 2014. Women were randomly assigned to intraoperative ('early') SCC (n = 17) versus postoperative ('late') SCC (n = 18). Main variables investigated were neonatal transition (Apgar score, arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate and temperature), maternal pain perception and both maternal and neonatal stress response by measuring the stress biomarkers salivary free cortisol and salivary alpha amylase. Results: There was no evidence for differences in parameters reflecting neonatal transition or stress response between the `Early SSC Group' and the `Late SSC Group'. Maternal salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels as well as maternal wellbeing and pain did not differ between the groups. However, the rise of maternal salivary alpha-amylase directly after delivery was higher in the `Early SSC Group' compared to the `Late SSC Group' (p = 0.004). Conclusions: This study did not reveal significant risks for the newborn in terms of neonatal transition when early SSC is applied in the operating room. Maternal condition and stress marker levels did not differ either, although the rise of maternal salivary alpha-amylase directly after delivery was higher in the `Early SSC Group' compared to the `Late SSC Group', which may indicate a stressor sign due to intensive activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullary-system. This needs to be further evaluated in a larger prospective randomized trial.

Data are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, a nationally representative, population-based survey of women delivering a live baby in 2001 (n = 9,350). Three delivery methods were examined: (1) vaginal delivery (reference); (2) medically indicated C-section; and (3) non-medically indicated C-sections. Using multinomial logistic regression, we examined the role of sociodemographics, health, healthcare, stressful life events, pregnancy complications, and history of C-section on the odds of medically indicated and non-medically indicated C-sections, compared to vaginal delivery. 74.2 % of women had a vaginal delivery, 11.6 % had a non-medically indicated C-section, and 14.2 % had a medically indicated C-section. Multivariable analyses revealed that prior C-section was the strongest predictor of both medically indicated and non-medically indicated C-sections. However, we found salient differences between the risk factors for indicated and non-indicated C-sections. Surgical deliveries continue to occur at a high rate in the US despite evidence that they increase the risk for morbidity and mortality among women and their children. Reducing the number of non-medically indicated C-sections is warranted to lower the short- and long-term risks for deleterious health outcomes for women and their babies across the lifecourse. Healthcare providers should address the risk factors for medically indicated C-sections to optimize low-risk delivery methods and improve the survival, health, and well-being of children and their mothers.

Few studies have used validated measures to explore depression, pain, and sexual dysfunction following vaginal or cesarean delivery over a prolonged time period. Objective: We examined the associations between vaginal and cesarean delivery and depressive symptoms, pain, and sexual function during the 1-year postpartum period. Design: A prospective, five-time-point longitudinal study. Setting: Maternity unit at a medical center. Participants: A total of 351 of 736 women completed a questionnaire that described demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, and pain levels at 3-5 days postpartum, and updated personal data, depressive symptoms, pain levels, and sexual function at 4-6 weeks and at 3, 6, and 12 months after delivery. Methods: Differences between the vaginal and cesarean groups in depressive symptoms, pain, and sexual function and trends of changes in these factors over the first postpartum year were examined. Results: Compared with the vaginal birth group, the cesarean birth group had a significantly higher prevalence of depressive symptoms at 3 months (p = 0.03); higher scores for non-localized pain at 3-5 days (p < 0.001), 4-6 weeks (p = 0.03), and 3 months (p = 0.046); higher scores for abdominal pain at 3-5 days (p < 0.001), 4-6 weeks (p < 0.001), and 6 months (p = 0.01); lower perineal pain scores at 3-5 days (p < 0.001); and higher sexual desire scores (p = 0.04) but lower sexual satisfaction scores (p = 0.02) at 4-6 weeks. Differences between the vaginal and cesarean groups were significant (p = 0.01, p = 0.049, respectively) in terms of the decrease in non-localized pain from 3-5 days to 4-6 weeks postpartum and the increase in sexual desire from 4-6 weeks to 3 months postpartum. Conclusions: Cesarean delivery was associated with an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms at 3 months and higher pain levels that persisted at 6 months postpartum in Taiwan. We found no difference in sexual function between vaginal and cesarean delivery after 6 weeks postpartum, and no differences in the trends related to depressive symptoms or in sexual functioning (except for desire) within 1 year postpartum.

Although numerous studies have reported rising breastfeeding initiation rates and duration, few longitudinally investigated the impact of shifting societal and lifestyle factors on breastfeeding patterns in developed nations. Methods: The Ulm Birth Cohort Study (UBCS) and Ulm SPATZ Health Study (SPATZ) cohorts consist of newborns and their mothers recruited, respectively, from 2000 to 2001 and 2012 to 2013 at the University Medical Center Ulm, Germany. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate crude and mutually adjusted hazard ratios for study effect (time trend) and individual risk factors on noninitiation and duration of predominant and total breastfeeding. Results: Compared with UBCS mothers, SPATZ mothers had lower cessation rates of both predominant breastfeeding by 4 months and total breastfeeding by 6 months: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.79 (0.67-0.93) and 0.71 (0.60-0.82), respectively. However, this crude time trend was limited to mothers with higher educational achievement. Similar time trend effects were observed among less educated mothers only after adjustment for early cessation risk factors. Mutually adjusted hazard ratios for individual risk factors were similar in both studies: low education, high BMI, smoking within 6 weeks of delivery, and cesarean delivery were associated with early breastfeeding cessation beginning at 6 weeks. In addition, actively abstaining from drinking alcohol was associated with lower rates of early cessation. Conclusions: Our results suggest widening socioeconomic disparity in breastfeeding and potentially subsequent child health, which may require new targeted interventions.

The aim of the current study was threefold: (a) to identify the prevalence rates of women suffering from fear of childbirth (FOC) and tokophobia (b) to explore the association between FOC, obstetrical and psychopathological variables and (c) to identify the independent predictors of the intensity of FOC symptoms, FOC and tokophobia. Methods: at 36 weeks' gestation, 98 women completed questionnaires assessing FOC, pretraumatic stress, fear of pain, depressive and anxiety symptomatology as well as perceived social support. Socio-demographic and gynecological data were also gathered. Results: 22.45% of women reported a probable FOC and 20.41% suffered from a potential tokophobia. Epidural anesthesia (ss = 5.62, p < 0.05), and the intensity of pretraumatic stress symptoms (ss = 0.69, p < 0.05), were independently associated with the intensity of FOC symptoms. Planning a c-section was significantly related to FOC (b = 0.09, p = 0.03). Planning an epidural anesthesia was also an independent predictor of both FOC and tokophobia (b = 1.33, p = 0.03; b = 1.26, p = 0.04, respectively). Conclusions: Given the high rates of FOC and tokophobia highlighted, developing an appropriate preparation to childbirth is of great relevance.

ECV services are now in place in many units in the United Kingdom but their effectiveness is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons for breech presentation at term birth. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 394 consecutive babies who were in breech presentation at term birth in a large United Kingdom maternity unit that offers ECV. The cohort was analyzed over two time periods 10 years apart: 1998-1999 and 2008-2009. Results: Only 33.8 percent of women had undergone a (failed) ECV attempt. This low proportion was mainly because breech presentation was not diagnosed antenatally (27.9%). Other contributing factors were: ECV not offered by clinicians (12.2%), ECV declined by women (14%), and contraindications to ECV (10.7%). Over the 10-year period, the proportion of breech presentations that were not diagnosed antenatally increased from 23.2 to 32.5 percent (p = 0.04), which constituted 52.8 percent of women who had not undergone an ECV attempt in 2008-2009. Failure of clinicians to offer ECV reduced from 21.6 to 3.0 percent (p = 0.0001) and the proportion of women declining ECV decreased from 19.1 to 9.0 percent (p = 0.005). Overall, ECV attempts increased from 28.9 to 38.5 percent (p = 0.05). Conclusions: Although ECV counseling, referral, and attempt rates have increased, failure to detect breech presentation antenatally is the principal barrier to successful ECV. Improved breech detection would have a greater impact than methods to increase ECV success rates.

Current recommendations favor suctioning only in the presence of considerable obstruction due to secretions, blood or other matter. We aimed to analyze the influence of oropharyngeal suctioning on cerebral and peripheral muscle oxygenation in term neonates during transition immediately after birth. Methods: We included term neonates after elective cesarean section for this prospective observational study. Oropharyngeal suctioning was performed based on the clinicians' judgment of threatening airway obstruction. From a total of 138 enrolled neonates, 36 were suctioned and then compared to 36 controls matched for gestational age. Heart rate (HR) and pre/postductal arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2pre/SpO2post) were measured by pulse oximetry. Cerebral (rSO2brain) and pre/postductal peripheral muscle tissue oxygenation (rSO2pre/rSO2post) were measured by near infrared spectroscopy during the first 15 min of life. Results: All neonates in both groups experienced normal postnatal transition with normal Apgar scores (Apgar 9/10/10) and with no events of apnea or bradycardia induced by suctioning. SpO2pre values were slightly lower at 2 and 4min after birth. Suctioning had no main and interaction effect on HR, SpO2post, rSO2brain, rSO2pre and rSO2post in the first 15 min after birth. Conclusion: In the present study we were able to show that, in term neonates, when correctly indicated, immediate postnatal oropharyngeal suctioning does not compromise cerebral and peripheral muscle tissue oxygenation. However, any suction maneuver must be performed with caution and strict indication during neonatal transition.

The objective of this study was to identify medical, migration, social, and health service predictors of unplanned cesareans among low-risk migrant women from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: We used a case-control research design. The sampling frame included migrant women from LMICs living in Canada less than 8 years, who gave birth at one of three Montreal hospitals between March 2014 and January 2015. Data were collected from medical records and by interview-administration of the Migrant-Friendly Maternity Care Questionnaire. We performed multi-variable logistic regression for low-risk women (i.e., vertex, singleton, term pregnancies) who delivered vaginally (1,615 controls) and by unplanned cesarean indicated by failure to progress, fetal distress, or cephalopelvic disproportion (233 cases). Results: Predictors of unplanned cesarean included being from sub-Saharan Africa/Caribbean (OR 2.37 [95% CI 1.02-5.51]) and admission for delivery during early labor (OR 5.43 [95% CI 3.17-9.29]).

Conclusion: Migrant women from sub-Saharan Africa/Caribbean and recently arrived migrant women with a humanitarian classification are at greater risk for unplanned cesareans compared with other low-risk migrant women from LMICs after controlling for medical factors. Strategies to prevent cesareans should consider the circumstances of migrant women that may be contributing to the use of unplanned cesareans in this population.

Method: This study was designed as a retrospective cohort study where children from patients given synthetic oxytocin during delivery were considered as the exposed cohort and children from patients not given oxytocin as the nonexposed cohort. From a total of 7465 births attended at our maternity ward in 2006, an initial sample of 400 was randomly selected. A total of 148 children were evaluated using the Battelle Developmental Inventory. Potential confounding and adjustment factors were analyzed using stratified analysis and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). Results: Oxytocin use did not significantly affect the overall risk of developmental delay in the study sample (relative risk, RR, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, CI [0.79-2.71]). The best fit regression model included twin delivery, type of delivery, and maternal age. In the group of vaginal noninstrumental deliveries, oxytocin administration increased the risk of poor Battelle Developmental Inventory outcome, particularly when maternal age was under 28 or over 35 years of age (odds ratio, OR, 67.14; 95% CI [5.46-824.86]). When delivery was instrumental or through cesarean section in mothers aged 28-35 years, oxytocin administration decreased the risk of developmental disorders (OR 0.16; 95% CI [0.04-0.66]). Conclusion: Although oxytocin administration during delivery did not affect the overall risk of low Battelle Developmental Inventory scores in the study sample, some effects were seen according to maternal age and type of birth.

The corrected affiliation of the author is present in the erratum.] Background: The potential that obesity in pregnancy has to affect symptoms associated with eating disorders and breastfeeding is unclear. Aim: This study analyzed symptoms of eating disorders and breastfeeding practices in obese mothers. Study design: Prospective, case-control study. Subjects: Participants included 25 obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) and 25 normal-weight puerperae, matched for parity and delivery route. Outcome measures: The participants completed the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2), investigating cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms of eating disorders before they were discharged from the maternity hospital and later participated in telephone interviews concerning breastfeeding practices which were classified according to WHO definitions. Results: Although none of the scores fell in the pathological range, the obese mothers had more and more pronounced symptoms of eating disorders in all EDI-2 subscales with respect to normal-weight mothers. They had, in particular, significantly higher scores in body dissatisfaction (p < .0001), ineffectiveness (p = .004), interoceptive awareness (p = .005), and maturity fear (p = .007). Finally, while breastfeeding practices were similar in the two groups, the obese mothers were more likely to maintain full breastfeeding at 6 months (20 vs 8%) and their tendency to postpone weaning was found to be significant (p < .04). Conclusions: While the obese mothers studied have more pronounced symptoms of eating disorders with respect to their normal-weight counterparts, they tended to maintain breastfeeding longer, postponing weaning.

Several studies have shown that not all eligible women undergo an ECV attempt. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of ECV in the Netherlands and to explain variation in implementation rates with hospital characteristics and individual factors. Methods: We invited 40 hospitals to participate in this retrospective cohort study. We reviewed hospital charts for all singleton breech deliveries from 36 weeks' gestation and onwards between January 2008 and December 2009. We documented whether an ECV attempt was performed, reasons for not performing an attempt, mode of delivery, and hospital characteristics. Results: We included 4,770 women from 36 hospitals. ECV was performed in 2,443 women (62.2% of eligible women, range 8.2-83.6% in different hospitals). Implementation rates were higher in teaching hospitals, hospitals with special office hours for ECV, larger obstetric units, and hospitals located in larger cities. Suboptimal implementation was mainly caused by health care providers who did not offer ECV. Conclusion: ECV implementation rates vary widely among hospitals. Suboptimal implementation is mostly caused by the care provider not offering the treatment and secondly due to women not opting for the offered attempt. A prerequisite for designing a proper implementation strategy is a detailed understanding of the exact reasons for not offering and not opting for ECV.

Observational studies have shown that offspring born by cesarean delivery are at increased risk of ill health in childhood, but these studies have been unable to adjust for some key confounding variables. Additionally, risk of death beyond the neonatal period has not yet been reported for offspring born by planned cesarean delivery. Objective: To investigate the relationship between planned cesarean delivery and offspring health problems or death in childhood. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based data-linkage study of 321 287 term singleton first-born offspring born in Scotland, United Kingdom, between 1993 and 2007, with follow-up until February 2015. Exposures: Offspring born by planned cesarean delivery in a first pregnancy were compared with offspring born by unscheduled cesarean delivery and with offspring delivered vaginally. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was asthma requiring hospital admission; secondary outcomes were salbutamol inhaler prescription at age 5 years, obesity at age 5 years, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, cancer, and death. Results: Compared with offspring born by unscheduled cesarean delivery (n = 56 015 [17.4%]), those born by planned cesarean delivery (12 355 [3.8%]) were at no significantly different risk of asthma requiring hospital admission, salbutamol inhaler prescription at age 5 years, obesity at age 5 years, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or death but were at increased risk of type 1 diabetes (0.66% vs 0.44%; difference, 0.22% [95% CI, 0.13%-0.31%]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05-1.75]). In comparison with children born vaginally (n = 252 917 [78.7%]), offspring born by planned cesarean delivery were at increased risk of asthma requiring hospital admission (3.73% vs 3.41%; difference, 0.32% [95% CI, 0.21%-0.42%]; adjusted HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.11-1.34]), salbutamol inhaler prescription at age 5 years (10.34% vs 9.62%; difference, 0.72% [95% CI, 0.36%-1.07%]; adjusted HR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.01-1.26]), and death (0.40% vs 0.32%; difference, 0.08% [95% CI, 0.02%-1.00%]; adjusted HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.05-1.90]), whereas there were no significant differences in risk of obesity at age 5 years, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, or cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: Among offspring of women with first births in Scotland between 1993 and 2007, planned cesarean delivery compared with vaginal delivery (but not compared with unscheduled cesarean delivery) was associated with a small absolute increased risk of asthma requiring hospital admission, salbutamol inhaler prescription at age 5 years, and all-cause death by age 21 years. Further investigation is needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal.

This study describes the maternal and neonatal outcomes for women who planned a VBAC at home with midwives who were contributing data to the Midwives Alliance of North America Statistics Project 2.0 cohort during the years 2004-2009. Method: Two subsamples were created from the parent cohort: 12,092 multiparous women without a prior cesarean and 1,052 women with a prior cesarean. Descriptive statistics were calculated for maternal and neonatal outcomes for both groups. Sensitivity analyses comparing women with a prior vaginal birth and those who were at the lowest risk with various subgroups in the parent cohort were also conducted. Results: Women with a prior cesarean had a VBAC rate of 87 percent, although transfer rates were higher compared with women without a prior cesarean (18% vs 7%, p < 0.001). The most common indication for transfer was failure to progress. Women with a prior cesarean had higher proportions of blood loss, maternal postpartum infections, uterine rupture, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions than those without a prior cesarean. Five neonatal deaths (4.75/1,000) occurred in the prior cesarean group compared with 1.24/1,000 in multiparas without a history of cesarean (p = 0.015). Conclusion: Although there is a high likelihood of a vaginal birth at home, women planning a home VBAC should be counseled regarding maternal transfer rates and potential for increased risk to the newborn, particularly if uterine rupture occurs in the home setting.

Latent labor hospital admission has been consistently associated with elevated maternal risk for increased interventions, including epidural anesthesia and cesarean delivery, longer hospital stay, and higher utilization of hospital resources. Methods: A cost-effectiveness model was built to simulate a theoretic cohort of 3.2 million term, medically low-risk women either being admitted in latent labor (< 4 cm dilation) or delaying admission until active labor (>= 4 cm dilation). Outcomes included epidural use, mode of delivery, stillbirth, maternal death, and costs of care. All probability, cost, and utility estimates were derived from the literature, and total quality-adjusted life years were calculated. Sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo simulation were used to investigate the robustness of model assumptions. Results: Delaying admission until active labor would result in 672,000 fewer epidurals, 67,232 fewer cesarean deliveries, and 9.6 fewer maternal deaths in our theoretic cohort as compared to admission during latent labor. Additionally, delaying admission results in a cost savings of $694 million annually in the United States. Sensitivity analyses indicated the model was robust within a wide range of probabilities and costs. Monte Carlo simulation found that delayed admission was the optimal strategy in 76.79 percent of trials. Conclusion: Delaying admission until active labor is a dominant strategy, resulting in both better outcomes and lower costs. Issues related to clinical translation of these findings are explored.

Absolute percent differences (risk differences) in early term delivery rates were calculated according to maternal characteristics, type of care provider, calendar time (day of the week, time of year), and annual institutional obstetrical volume. Of the 7,687 elective repeat cesareans at term in BC, 55 % occurred before 39 + 0 weeks. Early term delivery was significantly more common with multiple previous cesareans [8.2 percentage points (95 % CI 5.5, 10.9) for 2 previous cesareans, 11.3 (95 % CI 5.1, 17.4) for 3 or more previous cesareans], obesity [6.7 percentage points (95 % CI 1.6, 11.7)], and a hospital obstetrical volume < 2,500 deliveries per year. Type of care provider and calendar time were not significant risk factors for early term delivery.

The aims of the present study were to describe the rate of induced labor in Sweden from 1999 to 2012, and to assess the risk of unplanned cesarean delivery and vacuum extraction after induced labor in relation to medical complications and length of gestation. Methods: A register-based cohort study was conducted, including 1,078,536 women with spontaneous or induced onset of labor who gave birth by noninstrumental vaginal delivery, unplanned cesarean delivery, or vacuum extraction in gestational week 37 + 0 to 41 + 6. Logistic regression was used to study the association between induced labor and instrumental delivery. Results: The rate of induced labor increased from 7.7 to 12.9 percent among primiparous and from 7.5 to 11.8 percent among multiparous women. Induced labor was associated with 2-3 times greater risk of unplanned cesarean delivery among all women, except multiparas in gestational week 37-38, and with a 20-50 percent higher risk of vacuum extraction after the adjustment for confounding factors. Among women without a recognized medical complication, induced labor was associated with a threefold increased risk of cesarean delivery in gestational week 39-41 and a 40 percent increase in gestational week 37-38 compared with women with spontaneous onset of labor. Conclusions: The proportion of induced labors increased substantially during the 14-year study period and was associated with an increased risk of both cesarean delivery and vacuum extraction, even in women without a documented medical complication. The increased risk of instrumental delivery should be taken into account when counseling about the risks and benefits of induced labor.

The current research builds on this with Italian mothers-to-be. Objective: The present study (1) explored the influence of cognitive and emotional variables on labour and delivery outcomes and (2) examined how individual characteristics, couple adjustment, and medical factors influence the childbirth experience. Method: 121 Italian primiparous women participated in a prospective longitudinal study where participants completed a set of questionnaires between the 32nd and 37th week of pregnancy and again 30-40 days post-delivery. Results: Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that women with negative childbirth expectations were three times more likely to experience an emergency C-section or an instrumental vaginal delivery. Furthermore, childbirth expectations predicted subjective birth experience. This relationship between expectations and delivery type and the subjective childbirth experience was weak while other variables (such as anxiety, depression, couple adjustment) did not significantly influence delivery type or the subjective childbirth experience. Conclusions: The weak relationship between childbirth expectations and perinatal outcomes renders it necessary to question the nature of the relationship found in previous research, especially considering inconsistencies of the literature on the subject.

This study identifies the prenatal predictors for PPD (diagnostic interview) and postpartum depressive symptoms (PPDS) (self-report scale) in Mexican mothers at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Two hundred and ten women were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-I), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and various risk factor scales. Univariate logistic regressions showed that social support, marital satisfaction, life events, a history of psychopathology, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, the traditional female role, previous miscarriages/termination of pregnancy and unplanned/unwanted pregnancy were significant predictors for both PPD and PPDS at both assessment times in the postpartum. Education, age, marital status, income, occupation, parity, C-section and resilience were significant for only one of the measurements and/or at just one assessment time. General findings replicate a high- and low-income country observed psychosocial risk profile and confirm a sociodemographic and obstetric profile of vulnerability that is more prevalent in resource-constrained countries.

Methods: Our historical cohort study included all women who gave birth (>= 22 weeks) in our level III hospital from 2004 through 2013. The hospital discharge database enabled us to identify all women readmitted during the 42-day postpartum period or who underwent a surgical, medical, or interventional radiology procedure during their immediate postpartum hospitalization. We then examined all medical records to identify the cases involving severe secondary PPH. We studied the known risk factors of secondary PPH and assessed other potential ones: maternal age, multiple pregnancy, induction of labor, cesarean birth, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Results: The study included 63 women with a severe secondary PPH and 25,696 women without a secondary PPH. Immediate PPH (aOR 2.7 [95% CI 1.3-5.6]) and maternal age >= 35 years (aOR 2.0 [95% CI 1.1-3.7]) were the only factors associated with severe secondary PPH. Discussion: This cohort study confirms that immediate PPH is a risk factor for severe secondary PPH and reports for the first time an association between secondary PPH and advanced maternal age. It is likely that risk factors for immediate PPH are also risk factors for severe secondary PPH and thus that immediate PPH may be an intermediate factor between its own known risk factors and secondary PPH.

Objective: To review 20-year trends in maternal/neonatal care, complications, and mortality among extremely preterm infants born at Neonatal Research Network centers. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective registry of 34 636 infants, 22 to 28 weeks' gestation, birthweight of 401 to 1500 g, and born at 26 network centers between 1993 and 2012. Exposures: Extremely preterm birth. Main Outcomes and Measures: Maternal/neonatal care, morbidities, and survival. Major morbidities, reported for infants who survived more than 12 hours, were severe necrotizing enterocolitis, infection, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe intracranial hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, and/or severe retinopathy of prematurity. Regression models assessed yearly changes and were adjusted for study center, race/ethnicity, gestational age, birth weight for gestational age, and sex. Results: Use of antenatal corticosteroids increased from 1993 to 2012 (24%[348 of 1431 infants]) to 87%(1674 of 1919 infants]; P < .001), as did cesarean delivery (44%[625 of 1431 births] to 64%[1227 of 1921]; P < .001). Delivery room intubation decreased from80%(1144 of 1433 infants) in 1993 to 65%(1253 of 1922) in 2012 (P < .001). After increasing in the 1990s, postnatal steroid use declined to 8%(141 of 1757 infants) in 2004 (P < .001), with no significant change thereafter. Although most infantswere ventilated, continuous positive airway pressure without ventilation increased from 7%(120 of 1666 infants) in 2002 to 11% (190 of 1756 infants) in 2012 (P < .001). Despite no improvement from 1993 to 2004, rates of late-onset sepsis declined between 2005 and 2012 for infants of each gestational age (median, 26weeks [37% {109 of 296} to 27%{85 of 320}]; adjusted relative risk [RR],0.93 [95%CI,0.92-0.94]). Rates of other morbidities declined, but bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased between 2009 and 2012 for infants at 26 to 27 weeks' gestation (26 weeks, 50%[130 of 258] to 55%[164 of 297]; P < .001). Survival increased between 2009 and 2012 for infants at 23 weeks' gestation (27%[41 of 152] to 33%[50 of 150]; adjusted RR, 1.09 [95%CI, 1.05-1.14]) and 24weeks (63%[156 of 248] to 65%[174 of 269]; adjusted RR, 1.05 [95%CI, 1.03-1.07]), with smaller relative increases for infants at 25 and 27weeks' gestation, and no change for infants at 22, 26, and 28 weeks' gestation. Survival without major morbidity increased approximately 2% per year for infants at 25 to 28 weeks' gestation, with no change for infants at 22 to 24 weeks' gestation. Conclusions and Relevance: Among extremely preterm infants born at US academic centers over the last 20 years, changes in maternal and infant care practices and modest reductions in several morbidities were observed, although bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased. Survival increased most markedly for infants born at 23 and 24 weeks' gestation and survival without major morbidity increased for infants aged 25 to 28 weeks. These findings may be valuable in counseling families and developing novel interventions.

Objectives: To estimate the contemporary relationship between national levels of cesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional, ecological study estimating annual cesarean delivery rates from data collected during 2005 to 2012 for all 194 WHO member states. The year of analysis was 2012. Cesarean delivery rates were available for 54 countries for 2012. For the 118 countries for which 2012 data were not available, the 2012 cesarean delivery rate was imputed from other years. For the 22 countries for which no cesarean rate data were available, the rate was imputed from total health expenditure per capita, fertility rate, life expectancy, percent of urban population, and geographic region. Exposures: Cesarean delivery rate. Main Outcomes and Measures: The relationship between population-level cesarean delivery rate and maternal mortality ratios (maternal death from pregnancy related causes during pregnancy or up to 42 days postpartum per 100 000 live births) or neonatal mortality rates (neonatal mortality before age 28 days per 1000 live births). Results: The estimated number of cesarean deliveries in 2012 was 22.9 million (95% CI, 22.5 million to 23.2 million). At a country-level, cesarean delivery rate estimates up to 19.1 per 100 live births (95% CI, 16.3 to 21.9) and 19.4 per 100 live births (95% CI, 18.6 to 20.3) were inversely correlated with maternal mortality ratio (adjusted slope coefficient, -10.1; 95% CI, -16.8 to -3.4; P = .003) and neonatal mortality rate (adjusted slope coefficient, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.5; P < .001), respectively (adjusted for total health expenditure per capita, population, percent of urban population, fertility rate, and region). Higher cesarean delivery rates were not correlated with maternal or neonatal mortality at a country level. A sensitivity analysis including only 76 countries with the highest-quality cesarean delivery rate information had a similar result: cesarean delivery rates greater than 6.9 to 20.1 per 100 live births were inversely correlated with the maternal mortality ratio (slope coefficient, -21.3; 95% CI, -32.2 to -10.5, P < .001). Cesarean delivery rates of 12.6 to 24.0 per 100 live births were inversely correlated with neonatal mortality (slope coefficient, -1.4; 95% CI, -2.3 to -0.4; P = .004). Conclusions and Relevance: National cesarean delivery rates of up to approximately 19 per 100 live births were associated with lower maternal or neonatal mortality among WHO member states. Previously recommended national target rates for cesarean deliveries may be too low.

Design: Retrospective clinical audit from 1998 to 2011 and autoethnographic narrative of the midwifery program told by the longest serving midwives under three key themes relating to sustainable practice. Setting: Regional Health Service with annual birth rate of 500. Maternity care is provided by either public antenatal clinic/GP shared care or midwife-led care. Participants: Women attending a rural caseload midwifery group practice between the period 1998-2011 and midwives working in the same group practice during that period. Main outcome measures: Antenatal attendance, maternal mortality, infant morbidity and mortality, mode of birth, known midwife at birth, initiation of breastfeeding. Results: There were 1674 births between 1998 and 2011. Clinical outcomes for women and infants closely reflected national maternity indicator data. The group practice midwives attribute sustainability of the program to the enjoyment of flexibility in their working environment, to establishing trust amongst themselves, the women they care for, and with the obstetricians, GPs and health service executives. The rigorous application of midwifery principles including robust clinical governance have been hallmarks of success. Conclusion: This caseload midwifery group practice is a safe, satisfying and sustainable model of maternity care in a rural setting. Clinical outcomes are similar to standard care. Success can be attributed to strong leadership across all levels of policy, health service management and, most importantly, the rural midwives providing the service.

Methods: This analytic and cross-sectional research was carried out at Aydin Obstetrics and Gynecology and Children's Diseases Hospital. Three hundred twenty-seven primipara mothers who had delivered a single baby of healthy term at 37 or more gestational weeks with no previous experience with breastfeeding and who agreed to cooperate participated in the research. Results: The mothers' mean gestational week of delivery was 39.25 +- 1.10 weeks, and it was found that 56.0% had delivered by cesarean section and 57.0% had started to breastfeed immediately after the birth. The mothers' LATCH mean score was 6.55 +- 0.86; their postnatal breastfeeding self-efficacy mean score was found to be 59.10 +- 7.21. Mothers who had high success in breastfeeding at early postpartum were found to experience fewer problems with their breasts (Z = -2.65, p < 0.05), gave birth by vaginal delivery (Z = -2.88, p < 0.05), and had not received anesthesia during the delivery (Z = -2.52, p < 0.05). In the correlation analysis, it was seen that mothers with high success in breastfeeding also had high self-efficacy scores (r = 0.210, p = 0.003). Conclusion: The results of the research indicated that breastfeeding success in the early postpartum period reduced breast problems and increased the perception of breastfeeding self-efficacy in the late postpartum period.

However, similar studies on bipolar disorder (BPD) have been limited and the findings are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to examine the association between perinatal risk factors and BPD. Methods: This nested case-control study, based on the Finnish Prenatal Study of Bipolar Disorders (FIPS-B), identified 724 cases and 1419 matched controls from population based registers. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the associations between perinatal factors and BPD adjusting for potential confounding due to maternal age, psychiatric history and educational level, place of birth, number of previous births and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Results: Children delivered by planned cesarean section had a 2.5-fold increased risk of BPD (95% CI: 1.32-4.78, P <0.01). No association was seen between other examined perinatal risk factors and BPD. Limitations: The limitations of this study include: the restriction in the sample to treated cases of BPD in the population, and usage of hospital based clinical diagnosis for case ascertainment. In addition, in spite of the large sample size, there was low power to detect associations for certain exposures including the lowest birth weight category and pre-term birth. Conclusions: Birth by planned cesarean section was associated with risk of BPD, but most other perinatal risk factors examined in this study were not associated with BPD. Larger studies with greater statistical power to detect less common exposures and studies utilizing prospective biomarker-based exposures are necessary in the future.

The extent to which these measures are associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity is not known. Objective: To examine whether 2 Joint Commission obstetric quality indicators are associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based observational study using linked New York City discharge and birth certificate data sets from 2010. All delivery hospitalizations were identified and 2 perinatal quality measures were calculated (elective, nonmedically indicated deliveries at 37 or more weeks of gestation and before 39 weeks of gestation; cesarean delivery performed in low-risk mothers). Published algorithms were used to identify severe maternal morbidity (delivery associated with a life-threatening complication or performance of a lifesaving procedure) and morbidity in term newborns without anomalies (births associated with complications such as birth trauma, hypoxia, and prolonged length of stay). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to examine the association between maternal morbidity, neonatal morbidity, and hospital-level quality measures while risk-adjusting for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Individual- and hospital-level maternal and neonatal morbidity. Results: Severe maternal morbidity occurred among 2372 of 115 742 deliveries (2.4%), and neonatal morbidity occurred among 8057 of 103 416 term newborns without anomalies (7.8%). Rates for elective deliveries performed before 39 weeks of gestation ranged from 15.5 to 41.9 per 100 deliveries among 41 hospitals. There were 11.7 to 39.3 cesarean deliveries per 100 deliveries performed in low-risk mothers. Maternal morbidity ranged from 0.9 to 5.7 mothers with complications per 100 deliveries and neonatal morbidity from 3.1 to 21.3 neonates with complications per 100 births. The maternal quality indicators elective delivery before 39 weeks of gestation and cesarean delivery performed in low-risk mothers were not associated with severe maternal complications (risk ratio [RR], 1.00 [95%CI, 0.98-1.02] and RR, 0.99 [95%CI, 0.96-1.01], respectively) or neonatal morbidity (RR, 0.99 [95%CI, 0.97-1.01] and RR, 1.01 [95%CI, 0.99-1.03], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Rates for the quality indicators elective delivery before 39 weeks of gestation and cesarean delivery performed in low-risk mothers varied widely in New York City hospitals, as did rates of maternal and neonatal complications. However, there were no correlations between the quality indicator rates and maternal and neonatal morbidity. Current quality indicators may not be sufficiently comprehensive for guiding quality improvement in obstetric care.

However, changes in depression and anxiety over time in women who undergo an elective cesarean section (CS) have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to characterize the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and patterns of co-occurrence, and examined the associated predictors of depression and anxiety courses. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of childbearing women (N = 139) who underwent a CS was conducted. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were respectively assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Anxiety Inventory, in the third trimester and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Group-based modeling identified three distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms: group 1 (low, 30.9%), group 2 (mild, 41.7%), and group 3 (high, 27.3%). Four group trajectories of anxiety symptoms were identified: group 1 (low, 19.4%), group 2 (mild, 44.6%), group 3 (high, 28.8%), and group 4 (very high, 7.2%). Mild symptoms of both depression and anxiety were the most common joint trajectory. Depression trajectories were significantly related to anxiety trajectories (p < 0.001). Predictors of the joint trajectory included the pre-pregnant body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1~6.3) and a poor sleep score (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4~7.3) in the third trimester. Conclusions: Distinctive trajectories and co-occurrence patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified.

This study describes neonatal and maternal outcomes in mothers who started labor in German out-of-hospital settings. Method: In a retrospective analysis of German out-of-hospital data from 2005 to 2011, included were 24,545 parae II with a singleton pregnancy in a cephalic presentation at term (1,927 with a prior cesarean and 22,618 with a prior vaginal birth). Result: The overall VBAC rate was 77.8 percent. The intrapartum transfer rate to hospital was 38.3 percent (prior cesarean) versus 4.6 percent (prior vaginal) (p < 0.05), and the 10-minute Apgar < 7 rate was 0.6 versus 0.2 percent (p < 0.05), and the nonemergency intrapartum transfer rate was 91.5 versus 85.0 percent (p < 0.05). Prolonged first stage of labor was the most common reason for intrapartum transfer in both groups. The leading reason for postpartum transfer was retained placenta. Discussion: There was a high rate of successful VBAC in this study. The high nonemergency transfer rate for women with VBAC might mean that midwives are more cautious when attending women with a prior cesarean in out-of-hospital settings. Further studies are necessary to evaluate which women are suitable for VBAC in out-of-hospital settings.

In Finland, a trial of vaginal delivery is possible if strict selection criteria are met. As clinical practice in managing vaginal breech birth differs from that in normal delivery, the birth experience may also be different. This cohort study compares the childbirth experience between term breech and vertex deliveries. Methods: Intended vaginal term breech births from 2008 to October 2012 were included, and for every breech delivery, a vertex control was selected. The proportions of deliveries ending in a cesarean section and of mothers who had given birth vaginally before were equal in both groups. Three hundred eight mothers were sent the childbirth experience questionnaire and 170 returned it. Results: The birth experience does not differ between breech and vertex births, except for aspects with respect to the choice of birthing position. Indications of an even more positive experience were observed in the breech group, with the exception of the choice of analgesia, but these were not statistically significant. Primiparity, emergency cesarean section, infant birth trauma and prolonged hospital stay were identified as risk factors for a negative birth experience. Conclusion: The birth experience of vaginal breech birth seems to be at least as positive as the vaginal vertex birth experience.

Subjects and Methods: A cohort of 458 mothers was recruited from antenatal clinics at two major hospitals in Male', the Maldives. The mothers were followed up after birth at 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. The child's birth, the type of infant delivery, the time breastfeeding was initiated, gender of the infants, types of prelacteal feeds, and feeding method were recorded. Results: After birth, 4.1% of infants received infant formula from the hospitals, whereas 10.6% and 7.4% of them received honey and dates, respectively, as prelacteal ritual feeds. Factors associated with introduction of ritual feeds as prelacteal feeds included the infant being a boy (p = 0.05; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.98), attitude toward prelacteal feeds (p = 0.01; AOR = 2.87; 95% CI, 1.48-5.58), and maternal employment (p = 0.01; AOR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.9). Higher maternal age was inversely associated with introduction of ritual feeds as a prelacteal feed (p = 0.05; AOR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9). Introduction of infant formula as the prelacteal feed was positively associated with birth by cesarean section (p = 0.01; AOR = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.6-13.3) and inversely associated with maternal mother's feeding method being breastfeeding (p = 0.05; AOR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.6). Prelacteal feeding was associated with cessation of breastfeeding before 6 months (p = 0.01; AOR 6.0; 95% CI, 1.64-21.80). Conclusions: Health professionals need to distinguish between religious and cultural practices in order to develop appropriate health education programs to reduce the unnecessary use of early additional feeds. Understanding the barriers related to the initiation of breastfeeding after cesarean section is also important.

Methods: The PAINReportIt, a computerized version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, was administered in person to participants at two visits: between 24 and 48 hours postcesarean delivery and at 6 weeks postpartum. Descriptive statistics, t tests, and kh2 tests were calculated from these data and pain descriptor selections were compared with established nociceptive and neuropathic pain descriptor lists. Results: Pain was reported in all dimensions at both visits. The abdomen was most frequently selected for pain location; mean intensity was 2.75/10 at the first visit, 1.1/10 at the 6-week visit. Pain in the sensory and cognitive dimensions decreased significantly between visits. Affective dimension pain decreased, but the difference was not significant. Participants reported activities that increased and decreased pain in the behavioral dimension. Pain descriptors indicative of nociceptive (e.g., tender, sore) and neuropathic (e.g. aching) pain were selected at both visits. Conclusion: Postpartum pain after cesarean delivery is multidimensional and has been described with words indicative of nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Nurses should complete a thorough and comprehensive pain assessment throughout the postpartum for patients experiencing cesarean deliveries.

Methods: Cross-sectional study with women up to 12 weeks pregnant, performed in Itapecerica da Serra, Sao Paulo state, from December 2012 to May 2013. The sample consisted of 110 pregnant women with one or more vaginal deliveries or cesarean sections and 110 primigravidae. The PFMS was evaluated by perineometry (Peritron (TM)) and vaginal digital palpation (modified Oxford scale). Results: The average PFMS in pregnant women with a history of vaginal delivery or cesarean section was 33.4 (SD = 21.2) cmH2O. From the Oxford scale, 75.4% of the pregnant women with previous vaginal or cesarean deliveries presented grade <= 2, and 5.5% grade >= 4; among the primiparae, 39.9% presented grade <= 2, and 50.9% grade >= 4, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). From the perineometry, there was no statistically significant difference between the PFMS and age, type of delivery, parity, body mass index, and genitourinary tract symptoms, however, there was a statistically significant difference between the pregnant women with and without a history of episiotomy (p = 0.04). In the palpation, none of the variables showed a statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Pregnancy and childbirth can reduce the PFMS.

Methods: A total of 7496 births to 3990 mothers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 survey are examined. Outcomes include macrosomia, gestational length, incidence of low birthweight, preterm birth, large and small for gestational age (LGA, SGA), c-section, infant doctor visits, mother's and infant's days in hospital post-partum, whether the mother breastfed, and duration of breastfeeding. Association of outcomes with maternal pre-pregnancy obesity was examined using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to compare across mothers and fixed effects to compare within families. Results: In fixed effect models we find no statistically significant association between most outcomes and prepregnancy obesity with the exception of LGA, SGA, low birth weight, and preterm birth. We find that prepregnancy obesity is associated with a with lower risk of low birthweight, SGA, and preterm birth but controlling for prepregnancy obesity, increases in GWG lead to increased risk of LGA. Conclusions: Contrary to previous studies, which have found that maternal obesity increases the risk of c-section, macrosomia, and LGA, while decreasing the probability of breastfeeding, our sibling comparison models reveal no such association. In fact, our results suggest a protective effect of obesity in that women who are obese prepregnancy have longer gestation lengths, and are less likely to give birth to a preterm or low birthweight infant.

Methods: This is a case-control study of pediatric NMO, multiple sclerosis (MS), and healthy subjects. Early-life exposures were obtained by standardized questionnaire. Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus 1 antibody responses were determined by ELISA. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to adjust for age at sampling, sex, race, and ethnicity. Results: Early-life exposures were obtained from 36 pediatric subjects with NMO, 491 with MS, and 224 healthy controls. Daycare (odds ratio [OR] 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14, 0.78; p < 0.01) and breastfeeding (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18, 0.99; p = 0.05) were associated with lower odds of having NMO compared with healthy subjects. Cesarean delivery tended to be associated with 2-fold-higher odds of NMO compared with having MS/clinically isolated syndrome (OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.88, 4.59; p = 0.12) or with being healthy (OR 1.95, 95% CI 0.81, 4.71; p = 0.14). Sera and DNA were available for 31 subjects with NMO, 189 with MS, and 94 healthy controls. Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1, cytomegalovirus exposure, and being HLA-DRB115 positive were not associated with odds of having NMO compared with healthy subjects. Conclusions: Exposure to other young children may be an early protective factor against the development of NMO, as previously reported for MS, consistent with the hypothesis that infections contribute to disease risk modification. Unlike MS, pediatric NMO does not appear to be associated with exposures to common herpes viruses.

Methods: Secondary analysis of a multicenter cross-sectional study in 27 obstetric units in Brazil, using RTGCS. Cases were classified into potentially life-threatening condition or a maternal near miss or death, according to severity. Certain groups were subdivided for further analysis. Cesarean delivery (CD) rates were reported. Results: Among 7,247 women with severe maternal morbidity, 73.2 percent underwent CD. Group 10 (single, cephalic, preterm) was the most prevalent (33.9%). Groups mostly associated with a severe maternal outcome were: 7 (multiparous, breech), 9 (all abnormal lies, single, term), 8 (all multiple), and 10. Groups 1 (nulliparous, single, cephalic, term, spontaneous) and 3 (multiparous, single, cephalic, term, spontaneous) were associated with better maternal outcome. Group 3 had one severe maternal morbidity to 29 cases of potentially life-threatening, but the ratio was 1:10 for women undergoing CD, indicating a worse outcome. Group 4a (multiparous, no previous CD, single, cephalic, term, induced labor) had a better maternal outcome than those delivered by CD before labor (group 4b). Hypertension was the most common condition of severity. Conclusions: The RTGCS was useful to consider severe maternal morbidity, showing groups with higher CD rates and worse maternal outcomes.

In South Asia it is associated with cultural stigmas revolving around gender discrimination, abnormal births and genetic abnormalities. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was done at four teaching hospitals in Lahore from February, 2014 to June, 2014. A total of 500 pregnant women seen at hospital obstetrics and gynecology departments were interviewed with a questionnaire consisting of three sections: demographics, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). Pearson's chi-squared test, bivariate correlations and multiple linear regression were used to analyze associations between the independent variables and scores on the HADS and SPS. Results: Mean age among the 500 respondents was 27.41 years (5.65). Anxiety levels in participants were categorized as normal (145 women, 29%), borderline (110, 22%) or anxious (245, 49%). Depression levels were categorized as normal (218 women, 43.6%), borderline (123, 24.6%) or depressed (159, 31.8%). Inferential analysis revealed that higher HADS scores were significantly associated with lower scores on the SPS, rural background, history of harassment, abortion, cesarean delivery and unplanned pregnancies (P < .05). Social support (SPS score) mediated the relationship between the total number of children, gender of previous children and HADS score. Women with more daughters were significantly more likely to score higher on the HADS and lower on the SPS, whereas higher numbers of sons were associated with the opposite trends in the scores (P < .05). Conclusion: Because of the predominantly patriarchal sociocultural context in Pakistan, the predictors of antenatal anxiety and depression may differ from those in developed countries. We therefore suggest that interventions designed and implemented to reduce antenatal anxiety and depression should take into account these unique factors.

The aim of this study was to elicit the rates of exclusive breastfeeding, early initiation of breastfeeding, and colostrum feeding and to determine the attitudes, knowledge, and influences around breastfeeding in postpartum Vietnamese women. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hung Vuong Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, between December 2010 and January 2011. Postpartum women were randomly selected and interviewed within 48 hours of delivery. Results: Of the 223 women interviewed, 86% had initiated breastfeeding at the time of the interview. Modes of feeding included exclusive breastfeeding (7%), mixed feeding (79%), which included breastmilk and formula or water, and exclusive formula feeding (14%). Of the breastfeeding women, 14% had initiated breastfeeding within 60 minutes of delivery, 92% had initiated within 24 hours, and 8% had initiated after 24 hours of delivery. Of women who had initiated breastfeeding, 37% had discarded their colostrum. Factors that positively influenced breastfeeding were knowledge that breastfeeding is good for the infant, advice obtained from 'public information,' and the influence of health professionals and family on the decision to breastfeed. Factors that influenced the decision not to initiate breastfeeding included pain or fever after cesarean section and perceived lack of breastmilk after delivery. Conclusions: The rate of exclusive breastfeeding at Hung Vuong Hospital in this study was lower than the national average of 17%. Specific interventions targeting this must be formulated to increase these rates.

Study design: In a cross-sectional study, thymic size was measured at birth by the use of ultrasound. Information on possible determinants was collected from pregnancy cards, hospital records, and interviews with the mother. We used the log-transformed thymic index and thymus/weight index as outcome measures. Data were analyzed with adjusted linear regression models providing geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 95% CI. Results: Determinants of thymic size among normal birth weight infants were pathologic amniotic fluid (adjusted GMR for thymic index: 0.84 [0.74-0.96]) and male sex (GMR: 1.13 [1.06-1.22]). Among LBW infants, birth season (1.11 [1.01-1.22]), maternal body temperature (0.89 [0.79-0.98]), antibiotic treatment at the time of labor (0.84 [0.70-1.00]), number of pregnancy consultations (1.03 [1.00-1.05]), maternal age (0.91 [0.84-0.98]), Apgar score (1.06 [1.03-1.10]), and infant convulsions (0.44 [0.29-0.65]) were all independent determinants of thymic index but not all were determinants of thymus/weight index. Pathologic amniotic fluid and cesarean delivery were associated with thymus/weight index among LBW infants (0.85 [0.75-0.95] and 0.80 [0.67-0.96]) but were only borderline significant for thymic index.

We aim to describe the determinants of an excessive and insufficient NWL in the first 96 hours of life. Methods: A sample of 1,288 full-term singletons without congenital abnormality belonging to Generation XXI birth cohort was selected. Newborns were recruited in 2005-2006 at all public units providing obstetrical and neonatal care in Porto, Portugal. Information was collected by face-to-face interview and additionally abstracted from clinical records. Anthropometrics were obtained by trained examiners and newborn weight change (NWC) was estimated as (weight-BW)/BW x 100. We categorized NWL as excessive (below 10th percentile of the sample distribution of NWC: <=-9.4% of BW), normal (between 10th and 90th percentiles: -9.3 to -4.2%) and insufficient (above 90th percentile: >= -4.1%). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multinomial regression models. Results: Excessive NWL was positively associated with maternal age >=40 years (OR = 3.32, 95%CI 1.19-9.25), maternal education (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.09), cesarean delivery (OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.12-5.23), and phototherapy-treated jaundice (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.00-2.87). Insufficient NWL was positively associated with low BW (OR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.13-6.33), and formula/mixed feeding (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.13-2.66). Conclusion: Excessive NWL was positively associated with maternal age and education, cesarean delivery, and phototherapy-treated jaundice. Insufficient NWL reflected child's feeding. As breastfed newborns did not lose weight excessively, but newborns with formula/mixed feeding had insufficient NWL, our study supports that breastfeeding provides excellent nutrition during this period.

The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway constituted the data source for the present study. We included 57,279 pregnant women, of which 1.02% reported use of antidepressants during pregnancy, mostly SSRIs/SNRIs (0.92%). We categorized exposure according to antidepressant use in pregnancy (SSRIs/SNRIs, n = 527; TCAs/OADs, n = 59; nonexposed, nondepressed, n = 55,411) with inclusion of a disease comparison group (nonexposed, depressed, n = 1282). We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for vaginal bleeding outcomes in pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage. Compared with nonexposed subjects, first trimester exposure to SSRIs/SNRIs or TCAs/OADs did not confer any increased risk of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy (aOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72-1.16 and aOR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.36-1.92, respectively). No increased risk for vaginal bleeding in midpregnancy was observed among users of SSRIs/SNRIs (aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.50-1.31) or TCAs/OADs (aOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.26-3.53) in second trimester.

Using cross-sectional New York City birth and hospitalization data from 1995 to 2003 (n = 961,381) we estimated risk ratios for ethnic groups relative to non-Hispanic whites and immigrant women relative to US-born women. Adjusting for insurance, pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, education, parity, birthweight, gestational age, year, medical complications, and pregnancy complications, all ethnic groups except East Asian women were at an increased risk of cesarean delivery, with the highest risk among Hispanic Caribbean women [adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.27, 95 % CI (confidence interval) = 1.24, 1.30] and African American women (aRR = 1.20, 95 % CI = 1.17, 1.23). Among Hispanic groups, immigrant status further increased adjusted risk of cesarean delivery; adjusted risk ratios for foreign-born women compared to US-born women of the same ethnic group were 1.27 for Mexican women (95 % CI = 1.05, 1.53), 1.23 for Hispanic Caribbean women (95 % CI = 1.20, 1.27), and 1.12 for Central/South American women (95 % CI = 1.04, 1.21). Similar patterns were found in subgroup analyses of low-risk women (term delivery and no pregnancy or medical complications) and primiparous women. We found evidence of disparities by ethnicity and nativity in cesarean delivery rates after adjusting for multiple risk factors. Efforts to reduce rates of cesarean delivery should address these disparities.

At present there is no objective biometric to track the daily progression of the person for extended periods of time. Objective: We introduce new analytical techniques to process data from physically wearable sensors and help track the longitudinal progression of motions and physiological states upon the brain trauma. Setting and Participant: The data used to illustrate the methods were collected at the hospital settings from a pregnant patient in coma state. The patient had brain trauma from a large debilitating seizure due to a large tumor in the right pre-frontal lobe. Main Measures: We registered the wrist motions and the surface-skin-temperature across several daily sessions in four consecutive months. A new statistical technique is introduced for personalized analyses of the rates of change of the stochastic signatures of these patterns. Results: We detected asymmetries in the wrists' data that identified in the dominant limb critical points of change in physiological and motor control states. These patterns could blindly identify the time preceding the baby's delivery by C-section when the patient systematically brought her hand to her abdominal area. Changes in temperature were sharp and accompanied by systematic changes in the statistics of the motions that rendered her dominant wrist's micro-movements more systematically reliable and predictable than those of the non-dominant writst. Conclusions: The new analytics paired with wearable sensing technology may help track the day-by-day individual progression of a patient with post brain trauma in clinical settings and in the home environment.

Study design: Registry-based case-control study from all singleton births in Finland from 1990-2005. Cases with childhood autism, Asperger syndrome, or PDD (n = 4713) were identified from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Each case was matched to 4 controls on sex, date of birth, and place of birth. Information on obstetric risk factors was from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses. Results: When adjusted with confounders, childhood autism was associated with maternal high blood pressure (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.1-2.1, P = .018), Apgar scores less than 7 (1 minute, OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.1-2.0, P = .021), and neonatal treatment with monitoring (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.9, P = .038). PDD was associated with induced labor (OR 1.25 95% CI 1.1-1.5, P = .007), planned cesarean delivery (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.1-1.7, P = .009), 1-minute Apgar scores 7-8 ( OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, P = .008) and less than 7 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03-1.8, P = .032), and neonatal intensive care unit treatment (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.2-2.0, P = .003). Asperger syndrome was associated only with 1-minute Apgar scores 7-8 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.4, P = .018). Conclusions: Low Apgar scores as well as conditions requiring neonatal special follow-up are important risk factors for childhood autism and PDD. These findings suggest that fetal distress is a potential risk factor for these disorders, but not for Asperger syndrome.
