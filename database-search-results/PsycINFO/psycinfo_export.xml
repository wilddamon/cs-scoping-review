        <ab>Background: The prevalence and impact of fear of childbirth (FOC) has not been sufficiently understood. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of FOC among Chinese population and its impact on mode of delivery, postpartum mental health and breastfeeding. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study, wherein pregnant women in their third trimester who underwent antenatal assessments at Shanghai Changning Maternity and Infant Health Hospital between September 2020 and March 2021 were recruited. Sociodemographic data of the participants were gathered by self-administered questionnaire, and their FOC was assessed using the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire. Participants were followed up to 42 days postpartum. Information regarding their modes of delivery was retrieved from medical records, and data regarding postpartum mental health symptoms and one-month postpartum breastfeeding were obtained through self-administered questionnaires. Results: Among 1287 participants, 461 (35.8 %) had high-level FOC (W-DEQ ≥ 66). Logistic regressions showed that women with high-level of FOC had higher rates of caesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR) (aOR = 1.55, 95 % CI: 1.00–2.41, p = 0.049), a higher incidence of postpartum mental health symptoms (aOR = 1.68, 95 % CI: 1.09–2.59, p = 0.018), lower rates of one-month postpartum exclusive breastfeeding (aOR = 0.33, 95 % CI: 0.16–0.69, p = 0.003) and mixed feeding (aOR = 0.44, 95 % CI: 0.21–0.91, p = 0.028). Limitations: The long-term implications of FOC beyond the immediate postpartum period were not explored in the study. Conclusions: High-level FOC during the third trimester was associated with increased CDMR and postpartum mental health symptoms and reduced breastfeeding establishment. These results underscore the significance of FOC screening and tailored interventions for affected women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>ObjectivesThe rising cesarean birth rate globally has led to increasing concern about long-term unintended consequences, with particular focus on child neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study investigated the association between cesarean birth and early child neurodevelopment, measured at 3 years of age.MethodsThis was a large multicenter longitudinal prospective cohort study of first-time mothers and their offspring in Pennsylvania. Mothers completed adapted versions of two measures of child development at 36- months postpartum: the modified Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status (M-PEDS) and a shortened Ages and Stages Questionnaire (S-ASQ). Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between mode of delivery and delayed child development, controlling for confounding variables.ResultsThere were 695 (29.3%) children born by cesarean delivery and 1676 (70.7) born vaginally. Children born by cesarean had increased odds of scoring as developmentally delayed on both measures of child development: the M-PEDS (8.9% cesarean and 5.1% vaginal, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11–2.24)) and the S-ASQ (6.3% cesarean and 3.3% vaginal, aOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.09–2.54). Additional factors associated with developmental delay were male sex, and the maternal factors of high pre-pregnancy body mass index, thyroid disorder, and diabetes.ConclusionIn this large prospective cohort study of first-time mothers and their offspring, cesarean delivery was found to be associated with an elevated risk of delayed child development at age 3 years. This analysis highlights the importance of continued research to understand the impact of cesarean delivery on child development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Both endocannabinoid (EC) and endogenous opioid systems are involved in nociceptive processing and may work together synergistically based on preclinical models. This study evaluated the interactive effects of preoperative beta-endorphin (BE) concentrations (a key analgesic endogenous opioid) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and ECs (CSF and plasma 2-arachidonoylglycerol and plasma anandamide) on postoperative opioid use and pain intensity in a prospective cohort of n = 112 pregnant patients undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery. Maternal blood and CSF samples were collected preoperatively for BE and EC assays. Patients completed measures of outpatient opioid use (number of tablets used and days of use) and average pain intensity at 2 weeks postoperatively. Results of general linear model analyses controlling for maternal age, body mass index at time of delivery, and race revealed significant multiplicative interactions between EC and BE concentrations on number of opioid tablets used (based on pill count), days of opioid use, and total milligram morphine equivalents used in the 2-week follow-up period. Elevated preoperative plasma and CSF 2-arachidonoylglycerol predicted reduced outpatient opioid analgesic use, particularly for patients low in CSF BE. Similar analyses for pain intensity at 2-week follow-up indicated a significant interaction (P &lt; .02) characterized by higher preoperative BE concentrations being associated with lower subsequent pain only for individuals with low preoperative plasma anandamide concentrations. Further exploration of interactions between EC and endogenous opioid inhibitory systems as they influence responses to opioid analgesics in other clinical pain populations may help guide the development of precision pain management approaches. PERSPECTIVE: In the postoperative setting of patients undergoing cesarean delivery, elevated ECs were linked to reduced outpatient opioid analgesic use in individuals who had low endogenous opioid concentrations in CSF. Further exploration of interactions between these 2 inhibitory systems as they impact responses to pain management interventions appears warranted.

        <ab>Background: Lithium is the preferred treatment for pregnant women with bipolar disorders (BD), as it is most effective in preventing postpartum relapse. Although it has been prescribed during pregnancy for decades, the safety for neonates and obstetric outcomes are a topic of ongoing scientific debate as previous research has yielded contradicting outcomes. Our study aims to compare (re)admission rates and reasons for admissions in neonates born to women with bipolar disorders (BD) with and without lithium exposure. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a Dutch secondary hospital (two locations in Amsterdam). Women with BD who gave birth after a singleton pregnancy between January 2011 and March 2021 and their neonates were included. Outcomes were obtained by medical chart review of mothers and neonates and compared between neonates with and without lithium exposure. The primary outcome was admission to a neonatal ward with monitoring, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), 5-minute Apgar scores, neonatal asphyxia, and readmission ≤ 28 days. Results: We included 93 women with BD, who gave birth to 117 live-born neonates: 42 (36%) exposed and 75 (64%) non-exposed to lithium. There were no significant differences in neonatal admission with monitoring (16.7 vs. 20.0%, p = 0.844). Additionally, preterm birth (7.1 vs. 5.3%), SGA (0.0 vs. 8.0%), 5-minute Apgar scores (means 9.50 vs. 9.51), neonatal asphyxia (4.8 vs. 2.7%) and readmission (4.8 vs. 5.3%) were comparable. Overall, 18.8% of BD offspring was admitted. Women with BD had high rates of caesarean section ( 29.1%), gestational diabetes (12.8%) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (8.5%). Conclusions: In a sample of neonates all born to women with BD using various other psychotropic drugs, exposure to lithium was not associated with greater risk of neonatal admission to a ward with monitoring compared to non-exposure to lithium, questioning the necessity for special measures after lithium exposure. However, offspring of women with BD was admitted regularly and women with BD have high obstetric risk which require clinical and scientific attention.

        <ab>Background: Maternal symptoms of depression constitute an early adversity for infants that is considered to exert its effects via the maternal-placental-fetal neuroendocrine axis. Previous research implicates associations between maternal prenatal symptoms of depression and infants’ glucocorticoid (GC) levels shortly after birth. To date, associations have not been investigated in the early postnatal period. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of maternal perinatal symptoms of depression on infants’ neonatal and postnatal hair GCs providing a retrospective reflection of integrated cortisol secretion in the intrauterine and early postnatal period, respectively. Methods: As part of a prospective cohort study, hair samples of infants were taken up to two weeks after delivery (N = 152) and again eight weeks after delivery (N = 165). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine hair cortisol and cortisone in scalp-near 2-cm hair segments. Maternal symptoms of depression were assessed during pregnancy and eight weeks postnatally based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Results: Higher maternal prenatal symptoms of depression showed a significant association with higher infants’ neonatal hair cortisol, when controlling for confounding variables (i.e., gestational age, mode of delivery, parity, storage time, pregnancy complications). A non-significant trend for this effect was found for the hair cortisol-to-cortisone ratio while no effect occurred for hair cortisone. No association of maternal postnatal symptoms of depression with infants’ postnatal hair GCs was observed. Further exploratory analyses revealed no relationship between a change of maternal prenatal to postnatal symptoms of depression with the change from infants’ neonatal to postnatal hair GC levels or postnatal hair GCs. Conclusion: Our results suggest that maternal prenatal symptoms of depression are associated with dysregulated infants’ hair cortisol levels mainly incorporated in the intrauterine period which, in turn, might contribute to increased susceptibility for later diseases. However, no relationship was observed in infants’ hair samples additionally reflecting hair GCs of the early postnatal period. Future studies should consider research on associations between maternal symptoms of depression and infants’ hair GCs also later in life and take into account additional risk factors with potential impacts on GC secretion during early infancy.

        <ab>Objective: To examine how (a) parity and (b) mode of birth were associated with later Quality of Life (QOL) in young adult women, with a mean follow-up of 11.0 years. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Australia r sample: A total of 7770 women participating in the 1973–1978 cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Women’s Health. Methods Linear regression models were used to estimate (1) prospective associations between parity and mode of birth with eight subscale and two summary scores of the SF36, assessed after a mean follow-up of 11 years., and (2) differences between SF36 scores at follow up for women in different parity and mode of birth categories. Main outcome measure: Quality of Life as measured by the SF36 Results: Women experiencing no births (parity 0) and one birth (parity 1) had lower scores on all the physical health measures, and on some mental health measures, than women who had 2 births (parity 2) (all p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Parity and mode of birth may have long-term implications for women’s physical and mental health. Both childless and women with only one child had poorer physical and mental health than their peers with two children. Women with only caesarean section(s) also had poorer health than women who had vaginal birth/s. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 25(2) of Archives of Women's Mental Health (see record [rid]2022-45206-004[/rid]). The co-first author was not noted in the original manuscript. The author Shuangshuang Ma and Xiaoguang Yin contributed equally to this study, which should be marked by a special character, and stated in the manuscript. Additionally, the authors Peng Zhu and Daomin Zhu were the corresponding authors. Their equal contribution has been noted in the online manuscript, which should remain unchanged.] Maternal prenatal depression is associated with child sleep. We investigated whether maternal depression comorbid with anxiety worsens toddler’s sleep problems in a prospective cohort study. A total of 1583 mother-infant pairs from the China-Anhui Birth Cohort study were examined. The participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) at 30–34 weeks of gestation, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3-month postpartum. Toddler’s sleep was assessed by the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) at 30 months old. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between prenatal depression and anxiety and toddler’s sleep, while adjusting for maternal gestational age, education, family income, alcohol use, premature birth, fetal growth restriction, mode of delivery, postnatal depression, and 3-month breastfeeding. In total, 9.0% of participants reported prenatal depression comorbid with anxiety symptoms, and the prevalence of depression, anxiety was 6.7% and 7.3%, respectively. Compared with mothers without depression and anxiety, maternal depression combined with anxiety were significantly associated with shorter total sleep duration (11.16 ± 1.06 h), longer settling time (29.25 ± 23.57 min), and higher risk of toddlers’ sleep problems assessed by BISQ (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.22–3.57) or parental report (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.22–2.77). However, there was no significant association between maternal postnatal depression and toddler sleep behaviors. Maternal prenatal depression comorbid with anxiety significantly associated with poorer toddler’s sleep. Strategies to regulate prenatal mood status should be considered during prenatal health care to improve children’s sleep development.

        <ab>Objectives: The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the associations between maternal vitamin D status in late pregnancy and emergency caesarean section (EMCS) and birth asphyxia, in a population based sample of women in Sweden. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited at the antenatal care in Sweden and 1832 women were included after exclusion of miscarriages, terminated pregnancies and missing data on vitamin D status. Mode of delivery was retrieved from medical records. EMCS was defined as caesarean section after onset of labour. Birth asphyxia was defined as either 5 min Apgar score &lt; 7 or arterial umbilical cord pH &lt; 7.1. Serum was sampled in the third trimester of pregnancy (T3) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25OHD &lt; 30 nmol/L, and associations were studied using logistic regression analysis and expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AOR). Results: In total, 141 (7.7%) women had an EMCS and 58 (3.2%) children were born with birth asphyxia. Vitamin D deficiency was only associated with higher odds of EMCS in women without epidural anaesthesia (AOR = 2.01, p = 0.044). Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with higher odds of birth asphyxia (AOR = 2.22, p = 0.044). Conclusions for Practice: In this Swedish prospective population-based cohort study, vitamin D deficiency in late pregnancy was associated with doubled odds of birth asphyxia and with EMCS in deliveries not aided by epidural anaesthesia. Prevention of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women may reduce the incidence of EMCS and birth asphyxia. The mechanism behind the findings require further investigation.

        <ab>Background: Childbirth is an important life event and how women feel in retrospect about their first childbirth may have long-term effects on the mother, child, and family. In this study, we investigated the association between mode of delivery at first childbirth and birth experience, using a new scale developed specifically to measure women’s affective response. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of 3006 women who were interviewed during pregnancy and 1-month postpartum. The First Baby Study Birth Experience Scale was used to measure the association between mode of delivery and women’s postpartum feelings about their childbirth, taking into account relevant confounders, including maternal age, race, education, pregnancy intendedness, depression, social support, and maternal and newborn complications by way of linear and logistic regression models. Results: Women who had unplanned cesarean delivery had the least positive feelings overall about their first childbirth, in comparison to those whose deliveries were spontaneous vaginal (P &lt; .001), instrumental vaginal (P = .001), and planned cesarean (P &lt; .001). In addition, those who delivered by unplanned cesarean were more likely to feel disappointed (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.62-8.35]) and like a failure (adjusted OR 5.09 [95% CI 3.65-7.09]) in comparison to women who had spontaneous vaginal delivery; and less likely to feel extremely or quite a bit proud of themselves (adjusted OR 2.70 [95% CI 2.20-3.30]). Conclusions: Delivering by unplanned cesarean delivery adversely affects how women feel about their first childbirth in retrospect, and their self-esteem.

        <ab>Objective: To determine if cesarean delivery is adversely associated with child neurodevelopment as measured at 20 months and 7 years. Methods: In a prospective cohort study (n = 1328) in the Republic of Seychelles, we examined the association between mode of delivery and 22 measures of child neurodevelopment spanning multiple domains: cognition, executive and psychomotor function, language development, behavior, scholastic achievement, and social communication. Using multivariable linear regression, we evaluated the relationship between delivery mode (Cesarean/vaginal delivery) and each developmental outcome, while controlling for relevant covariates including child sex and age, maternal age, maternal IQ, whether both parents lived with the child, and Hollingshead socioeconomic status. Results: At 20 months, children born via cesarean delivery had slightly higher scores (β = 0.11, 95% confidence interval: 0.00, 0.21) on the Infant Behavior Questionnaire–Revised Positive Affectivity/Surgency subtest, a measure of infant temperament, as compared to vaginal delivery. Delivery mode was not associated with any of the 7-year developmental outcomes. Conclusions for Practice: Our study does not support the notion that cesarean delivery is associated with child neurodevelopmental outcomes.

        <ab>Background: Antenatal depression might cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, previous study results were inconsistent, especially in the low- and middle- income countries. We aimed to study the association between antenatal depression and adverse perinatal outcomes in a Chinese population. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study and enrolled pregnant women from January 2020 to January 2021. Antenatal depressive symptoms in the third trimester of pregnancy were evaluated by the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). Baseline characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were recorded. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, occupation, education level, and annual income), multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the associations between antenatal depression and pregnancy outcomes. Results: Among the 5209 participants, 1448 (27.7 %) pregnant women were positive for depression. After adjusting for potential confounders, women with antenatal depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to deliver prematurely [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.404, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.020–1.933, P = 0.037] and receive cesarean section (OR = 1.154, 95 % CI = 1.002–1.331, P = 0.048). Limitations: EPDS, not a structured diagnostic interview, was used for psychological assessment. In addition, we only screened the women in their third trimester in a single research center. The association between the duration of antenatal depression and perinatal outcomes was not evaluated. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms were common among Chinese women in their third trimester of pregnancy. Women with antenatal depressive symptoms had increased cesarean section and preterm delivery risks. Screening and treatment for antenatal depression are needed during the prenatal care.

        <ab>Objective: To describe the experiences of pregnancy and birth after cesarean of women who live in rural areas of the United States, including access to vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), type of maternity care provider, travel times, autonomy in decision making, and respectful maternity care. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: Online questionnaire of women who gave birth in the United States. Participants: Women (N = 1,711) with histories of cesarean and subsequent births within 5 years of participating. Methods: We calculated descriptive and bivariate statistics by identified areas of residence and stratified measures of autonomy and respectful maternity care by self-identification as a member of a racialized group. We applied qualitative descriptive analysis to responses to an open-ended survey question. Results: A total of 299 (17.5%) participants identified their areas of residence as rural. Similar percentages of rural and metropolitan participants were able to plan VBAC (p = .88). More rural participants than metropolitan participants reported travel times of more than 60 minutes to give birth (p &lt; .001), and fewer had obstetricians (p = .002) or doulas (p = .03). Rural participants from racialized groups experienced significantly less respectful maternity care than White, non-Hispanic rural participants and all metropolitan participants (p = .04). Qualitative data illustrating the main findings are included. Conclusions: Our findings highlight challenges faced by rural residents accessing VBAC and help explain why rates of VBAC in rural areas remain low. We suggest a range of clinical and policy strategies to improve access to VBAC in rural areas and to improve the quality of maternity care for racialized women who live in rural areas.

        <ab>Reports an error in 'Association of maternal prenatal depression and anxiety with toddler sleep: The China-Anhui birth cohort study' by Shuangshuang Ma, Xiaoguang Yin, Ruixue Tao, Xiaomin Jiang, Jun Xie, Pei Li, Daomin Zhu and Peng Zhu (Archives of Women's Mental Health, Advanced Online Publication, Jan 8, 2022, np). The co-first author was not noted in the original manuscript. The author Shuangshuang Ma and Xiaoguang Yin contributed equally to this study, which should be marked by a special character, and stated in the manuscript. Additionally, the authors Peng Zhu and Daomin Zhu were the corresponding authors. Their equal contribution has been noted in the online manuscript, which should remain unchanged. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-22258-001[/rid]). Maternal prenatal depression is associated with child sleep. We investigated whether maternal depression comorbid with anxiety worsens toddler’s sleep problems in a prospective cohort study. A total of 1583 mother-infant pairs from the China-Anhui Birth Cohort study were examined. The participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) at 30–34 weeks of gestation, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3-month postpartum. Toddler’s sleep was assessed by the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) at 30 months old. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between prenatal depression and anxiety and toddler’s sleep, while adjusting for maternal gestational age, education, family income, alcohol use, premature birth, fetal growth restriction, mode of delivery, postnatal depression, and 3-month breastfeeding. In total, 9.0% of participants reported prenatal depression comorbid with anxiety symptoms, and the prevalence of depression, anxiety was 6.7% and 7.3%, respectively. Compared with mothers without depression and anxiety, maternal depression combined with anxiety were significantly associated with shorter total sleep duration (11.16 ± 1.06 h), longer settling time (29.25 ± 23.57 min), and higher risk of toddlers’ sleep problems assessed by BISQ (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.22–3.57) or parental report (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.22–2.77). However, there was no significant association between maternal postnatal depression and toddler sleep behaviors. Maternal prenatal depression comorbid with anxiety significantly associated with poorer toddler’s sleep. Strategies to regulate prenatal mood status should be considered during prenatal health care to improve children’s sleep development.

        <ab>Background: Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are naturally occurring glycans in human breast milk that act as prebiotics in the infant gut. Prebiotics have been demonstrated to suppress appetite in both adults and children. Therefore, HMOs may affect infant eating behaviour. Objective: To determine if HMOs in breast milk are associated with eating behaviour in Hispanic infants. Methods: Cross‐sectional analysis of a prospective cohort of Hispanic mother‐infant dyads (1‐month, n = 157; 6‐months, n = 69). Breast milk samples were screened for 19 HMOs using high pressure liquid chromatography, and eating behaviour was assessed using the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (BEBQ). We conducted multiple linear regressions to examine associations between HMOs and BEBQ scores, adjusted for maternal pre‐pregnancy BMI, infant sex, birthweight, delivery mode and number of breastfeedings per day. We stratified by HMO secretor status—a genetic determinant of the types of HMOs produced. Results: At 1 month, LNnT (lacto‐N‐neotetraose; P = .04) was negatively associated with food responsiveness in the total sample, while DFLNT (difucosyllacto‐N‐tetrose; P = .03) and DSLNT (disialyl‐LNT; P = .04) were negatively associated with food responsiveness in secretors only. At 6 months, LSTc (sialyllacto‐N‐tetraose c; P = .01), FLNH (fucosyllacto‐N‐hexaose; P = .03), LNH (lacto‐N‐hexaose; P = .006) and DSLNH (disialyllacto‐N‐hexaose; P = .05) were positively associated with food responsiveness in both the total sample and secretors only. Conclusions: We found several HMOs that were both positively and negatively associated with infant food responsiveness, which is a measure of drive to eat.

        <ab>Purpose: This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the interrelation between preferred/actual mode of delivery and pre- and postpartum fear of childbirth (FOC). Material and methods: Participants from 13 midwifery practices and four hospitals in Southwest Netherlands filled out questionnaires at 30 weeks’ gestation (n = 561) and two months postpartum (n = 463), including questions on preferred mode of delivery, the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Results were related to obstetric data. Results: Both severe FOC (OR 7.0, p &lt; .001) and previous Cesarean section (CS) (OR 16.6, p &lt; .001) predicted preference for CS. Severe prepartum FOC also predicted actual CS. Preferring a vaginal delivery (VD) and actually having a CS predicted higher postpartum W-DEQ scores (partial r = 0.107, p &lt; .05). Other significant predictors for high postpartum W-DEQ scores were high prepartum W-DEQ (partial r = 0.357) and HADS anxiety scores (partial r = 0.143) and the newborn in need of medical assistance (partial r = −0.169). Conclusions: Women preferring a VD but ending up with a CS are at risk for severe FOC postpartum, while the same risk was not demonstrated for women who preferred a CS but had a VD. Prepartum FOC is strongly associated with postpartum FOC, regardless of congruence between preferred and actual mode of delivery. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Childbirth trauma is common and increases risk for postpartum depression (PPD). However, we lack brief measures to reliably identify individuals who experience childbirth trauma and who may be at greater prospective risk for PPD. To address this gap, we used data from a racially diverse prospective cohort (n=1082). We collected survey data during pregnancy and at 12 weeks postpartum, as well as clinician-reported data from medical records. A new three-item measure of patient-reported childbirth trauma was a robust and independent risk factor for PPD, above and beyond other known risk factors for PPD, including prenatal anxiety and depression. Cesarean birth, greater blood loss, and preterm birth were each associated with greater patient-reported childbirth trauma. Finally, there were prospective indirect pathways whereby cesarean birth and higher blood loss were related to higher patient-reported childbirth trauma, in turn predicting greater risk for PPD. Early universal postpartum screening for childbirth trauma, targeted attention to individuals with childbirth complications, and continued screening for depression and anxiety can identify individuals at risk for PPD. Such efforts can inform targeted interventions to improve maternal mental health, which plays a vital role in infant development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pregnancy is a time of increased vulnerability for the development of anxiety and depression. The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of developing adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes between pregnant women with moderate-severe depression and those who had mild depression. Methods: Our study was performed in a prospective cohort of 360 depressed pregnant women, recruited and followed up to delivery at the Adventist Hospital in Bekwai Municipality, Ghana. The research began in February 2020 and the follow-up was completed in August 2020. The pregnant women who had depression were classified into two groups: those who had moderate-severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaires-9 (PHQ-9) score ≥15) and those who had mild depression (PHQ-9 score &lt;15). Crude and adjusted relative risk (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for women with moderate-severe depression as compared with women with mild depression were then estimated. Result: Out of a total of 360 pregnant women, 43 (11.9%) screened positive for moderate-severe depression. After adjusting for potential confounders, women with moderate-severe depression during pregnancy, as compared with women who had mild depression had an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (RR adjusted = 2.01; 95% CI:1.21–3.33); Caesarean section (RR adjusted = 1.78; 95% CI:1.18–2.70); and episiotomy (RR adjusted = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.06–2.60). On the other hand, no statistically significant association of severity of depression and perinatal outcomes was observed. Conclusion: Compared with mild depression, symptoms of moderate-severe depression in pregnancy significantly increased risks of adverse maternal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, caesarean section delivery, and episiotomy.

        <ab>Objective: Previous studies indicated associations between cesarean section (CS), breastfeeding, and depressive symptoms. There is, however, little research integrating these variables into one model to analyze their interrelations. The aim of this observational prospective longitudinal study is to examine whether the effect of CS on postpartum depressive symptoms is mediated by difficulties with breastfeeding. Methods: The participants were recruited in 5 maternity hospitals during their prenatal medical check-ups. Breastfeeding status was self-reported by the mothers six weeks postpartum. Screening for depressive symptoms was performed at six weeks (N = 404) and nine months (N = 234) postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Path analysis was used to model the relations between CS, breastfeeding, and depressive symptoms. Results: No direct effects of CS on depressive symptoms at six weeks or nine months postpartum were found. CS was associated with a lower probability of exclusive breastfeeding, which was, in turn, associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms six weeks postpartum. The analysis stratified by type of CS revealed that the effect on breastfeeding only occurred with emergency, not planned, CS. The effect of CS on breastfeeding was noticeably stronger in women without versus with a history of depression. Conclusion: Emergency CS predicts breastfeeding difficulties, which are, in turn, associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Support should be provided to mothers with emergency CS and breastfeeding problems to reduce the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period.

        <ab>Background: The relationship between postpartum depression symptoms (PPDS) and gestational weight gain is controversial. We aimed to examine the risk of gestational weight gain for PPDS at 1 month postpartum based on the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Methods: A prospective cohort study recruited 80 927 Japanese women 2011-2014. They categorized according to their pre-pregnancy BMI into group 1 (&lt;18.5 kg/m²), group 2 (18.5 to &lt;20.0 kg/m²), group 3 (20.0 to &lt;23.0 kg/m²), group 4 (23.0 to &lt;25.0 kg/m²), and group 5 (≧ 25.0 kg/m²). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for each BMI category to identify potential risk factors of insufficient or excessive gestational weight gain associated with PPDS, following adjustments for maternal age, education, annual household income, smoking, parity, mode of delivery, cessation of breast feeding, psychological stress, and daily energy intakes during pregnancy. Results: Among participants in group 3, insufficient gestational weight gain was a risk factor for PPDS (adjusted odds ratio: 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.14–1.36). This result was not modified by intermediate factors. Limitations: The criteria of appropriate gestational weight gain were determined from the adverse pregnancy outcomes not validated for PPDS. Other confounding factors for PPDS like psychotic disorders were not examined. Conclusions: For women with a pre-pregnancy BMI between 20.0 and &lt;23.0 kg/m², insufficient gestational weight gain is a risk factor for PPDS. Therefore, monitoring gestational weight gain is recommended for the early detection of PPDS in these women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a chronic psychiatric condition with somatic morbidity that requires continuous mood stabilizing treatment to prevent relapses. Pregnant women with BD have shown an increased rate of caesarean section (C-Section) in comparison with women without BD. Because specific differentiated profiles between mothers with BD that require C-Section and those that do not require C-Section have not been largely discussed, we aim to explore the risk factors associated with the type of delivery in pregnant women with BD. A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Perinatal Mental Health Unit. 100 pregnant women with BD were followed throughout their pregnancy by obstetric and psychiatric services at the same hospital. The cohort was developed in order to compare psychiatric and obstetric outcomes between women with BD that required C-Section (N = 40) versus women that did not require C-Section (N = 60). Final regression models showed an increased risk for obstetric complications during labour (OR 4,52, 95% CI 1,66–12,29), higher rates of hypothyroidism (OR 3,73, 95% CI 1,04–13,73) and treatment with lithium + antidepressant (OR 4,24, 95% CI 1,34–13,40) amongst the C-Section group when compared to the non-C-Section group. In our sample, women with BD treated with lithium plus antidepressant, with hypothyroidism and without obstetric complications have a 70,5% probability of C-Section. In conclusion, psychopharmacology and thyroid function might help understanding which women with BD will have more probability of C-Section. The implementation of more targeted interventions in selected patients might be useful to avoid complications during delivery. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine whether the presence of a birth plan was associated with mode of delivery, obstetrical interventions, and patient satisfaction. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies greater than 34 weeks’ gestation powered to evaluate a difference in mode of delivery. Maternal characteristics, antenatal factors, neonatal characteristics, and patient satisfaction measures were compared between groups. Differences between groups were analyzed using chi-squared for categorical variables, Fisher exact test for dichotomous variables, and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous or ordinal variables. Results: Three hundred women were recruited: 143 (48%) had a birth plan. There was no significant difference in the risk of cesarean delivery for women with a birth plan compared with those without a birth plan (21% vs 16%, adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-2.04]). Women with a birth plan were 28% less likely to receive oxytocin (P &lt; .01), 29% less likely to undergo artificial rupture of membranes (P &lt; .01), and 31% less likely to have an epidural (P &lt; .01). There was no difference in the length of labor (P = .12). Women with a birth plan were less satisfied (P &lt; .01) and felt less in control (P &lt; .01) of their birth experience than those without a birth plan. Conclusion: Women with and without a birth plan had similar odds of cesarean delivery. Though they had fewer obstetrical interventions, they were less satisfied with their birth experience, compared with women without birth plans. Further research is needed to understand how to improve childbirth-related patient satisfaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: After one previous caesarean section (CS), pregnant women can deliver by elective repeat CS or have a trial of labor which can end in a vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) or an unplanned CS. Despite guidelines describing women’s rights to make an informed choice, trial of labor and VBAC rates vary greatly worldwide. Many women are inadequately informed due to caregivers’ fear of an increase in CS rates in a high VBAC rate setting. We compared counseling with a decision aid (DA) including a prediction model on VBAC to care as usual. We hypothesize that counselling with the DA does not decrease VBAC rates. In addition, we aimed to study the effects on unplanned CS rate, patient involvement in decision- making and elective repeat CS rates. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study. From 2012 to 2014, 483 women in six hospitals, where the DA was used (intervention group), were compared with 441 women in six matched hospitals (control group). Women with one previous CS, pregnant of a singleton in cephalic presentation, delivering after 37 weeks 0 days were eligible for inclusion. Results: There was no significant difference in VBAC rates between the intervention (45%) and control group (46%) (adjusted odds ratio 0,92 (95% Confidence interval 0.69–1.23)). In the intervention group more women (42%) chose an elective repeat CS compared to the control group (31%) (adjusted odds ratio 1.6 (95% Confidence interval 1.18–2.17)). Of women choosing trial of labor, in the intervention group 77% delivered vaginally compared to 67% in the control group, resulting in an unplanned CS adjusted odds ratio of 0,57 (0.40–0.82) in the intervention group. In the intervention group, more women reported to be involved in decision-making (98% vs. 68%, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Implementing a decision aid with a prediction model for risk selection suggests unchanged VBAC rates, but 40% reduction in unplanned CS rates, increase in elective repeat CS and improved patient involvement in decision-making.

        <ab>Background: Delayed onset of lactation is a key factor in the low rate of exclusive breast-feeding in 6 months after caesarean section. The mechanism of delayed onset of lactation is not clear. Milk production depends largely on mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is closely related to mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid copy number and adenosine triphosphate production. Presently, it is unclear whether a difference in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio exists between those undergoing vaginal delivery and those undergoing caesarean delivery and, if so, whether the difference correlates to the time of onset of lactation. Objectives: To identify whether the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio at 24 hours after delivery is different between mothers delivering by caesarean section and those giving birth vaginally and whether the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is related to the delayed onset of lactation. Design: The study adopted a prospective cohort study design. Settings: Maternity units of an Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Hospital. Participants: 327 mother-infant pairs who met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were followed up to the time of onset of lactation. Methods: Mother-infant pairs were allocated to the vaginal birth group or the caesarean section group according to birth method. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was calculated as the absolute value of neutrophils divided by the absolute value of lymphocytes based on full blood counts. Before delivery, full blood counts were obtained from medical records. After delivery, blood samples were drawn 24 hours postpartum, and blood cells were classified and counted. The onset of lactation was confirmed by the maternal perception of breast fullness. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and its relationship with lactation onset were analyzed by multivariable regression. Results: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios of both groups were elevated after delivery. Based on the covariance analysis, after adjusting for baseline full blood counts before delivery, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in the caesarean group was higher than the ratio in the vaginal group after delivery (p = .000). In addition, after adjustment for confounding factors, multivariable regression analyses showed that an increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was correlated with delayed onset of lactation (95% confidence interval 0.285–1.646). Conclusions: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in the caesarean section group was higher than that in the vaginal delivery group and was related to a delayed onset of lactation. Given the decreased mitochondrial copy number in the elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and therefore the associated reduction in adenosine triphosphate synthesis, these findings may elucidate the mechanism for delayed onset of lactation in caesarean section births.

        <ab>Objective: To assess the association between fear of childbirth (FOC) and emergency caesarean section. Design: A prospective cohort study of low-risk nulliparous women at term. Setting: Nine obstetric departments in Denmark, May 2004–July 2005. Population: A total of 2598 nulliparous women in spontaneous labor with a single fetus in cephalic presentation at term. Methods: Self-reported FOC was assessed at 37 weeks of gestation by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) version A and at admission to the labor ward by the Delivery Fear Scale (DFS). Mode of delivery was recorded by the attending staff. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR). Main outcome measures: Risk of emergency caesarean section in women who feared childbirth. Results: FOC (W-DEQ sum score ≥ 85 and DFS sum score ≥ 70) was not associated with emergency caesarean section: adjusted OR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.48–1.36) and OR = 0.97 (95% CI: 0.55–1.71), respectively. Conclusion: In this prospective observational study, women with FOC did not have an increased risk of emergency caesarean section compared to women with no such fear.

        <ab>Background: Increasing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) incidence has been proposed to be caused by factors influencing microbiota in early life. We investigated the potential causality between ADHD and two surrogate markers for changes in children's microbiota: birth delivery mode and early childhood antibiotic use. Method: This population‐based, prospective cohort study linked nationwide registers of data for native Danish singleton live births in Denmark from 1997 to 2010. Exposure variables were delivery mode and antibiotic use during the first 2 years of life. The main outcome measure was ADHD diagnosis or redeemed ADHD medication prescriptions. For statistical analysis, we used both advanced sibling models and a more traditional approach. Results: We included 671,592 children, followed from their second birthday in the period 1999–2014 for 7,300,522 person‐years. ADHD was diagnosed in 17,971. In total, 17.5% were born by cesarean delivery, and 72% received antibiotic treatment within their first 2 years of life. In the adjusted between‐within sibling survival model, mode of delivery or antibiotics had no effect on ADHD when compared with vaginal delivery or no antibiotic treatment as hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.97–1.24) for intrapartum cesarean, 1.03 (0.91–1.16) for prelabor cesarean, 0.98 (0.90–1.07) for penicillin, and 0.99 (0.92–1.06) for broader spectrum antibiotics. In a sibling‐stratified Cox regression, intrapartum cesarean was associated with increased ADHD risk, but other exposures were not. In a descriptive, nonstratified Cox model, we found increased risk for ADHD for all exposures. Conclusions: Detailed family confounder control using the superior between‐within model indicates that cesarean delivery or use of antibiotics during the first 2 years of life does not increase ADHD risk. Therefore, our study suggests that changes in children's microbiota related to cesarean delivery or antibiotic use, do not cause ADHD.

        <ab>Background: The gut microbiota of children delivered by cesarean section differs from that of children delivered vaginally. In light of the gut-brain axis hypothesis, cesarean section may influence risk of affective disorders. Methods: Population based prospective cohort study included Danish children born 1982 through 2001, with follow-up until 2015. The effect of delivery mode on the risk of affective disorders was assessed using a standard Cox model and two types of Cox sibling models. Diagnostic codes or prescriptions for antidepressants and lithium were used to define cases of affective disorders. Results: 1,009,444 children were followed for 8,880,794 person-years from the age of 13 years, with relevant covariates available from birth. There are strong calendar time trends in the occurrence of affective disorders with an increasingly younger age at first diagnosis and with a hotspot between the years 2007–2012. Fully adjusted standard Cox models showed an increased risk of affective disorders for both pre-labor (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–1.15) and intrapartum (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05–1.10) cesarean section, compared to vaginal delivery. This effect disappeared in the between–within sibling model for pre-labor (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.94–1.07) but not intrapartum (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00–1.12) cesarean section. Limitations: Interpretation of results from sibling models may not be relevant to children without siblings. Conclusions: These results do not support the hypothesis that a delivery-mode dependent change in gut microbiota is a cause of subsequent affective disorders, despite an apparent association with delivery mode.

        <ab>Purpose: Current research fails to adequately inform about the differential use of available levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs) in real life. Aim of our study was to compare the characteristics, satisfaction, continuation rates, and adverse effects between users of the high-dose LNG-IUS (52 mg) and of the low dose LNG-IUS (13.5 mg and 19.5 mg). Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed in two Services for Family Planning in normal menstruating women with the inclusion of all new prescriptions of LNG-IUS for contraception. Women were followed for a mean of 9.1 ± 2.6 months after placement. Results: 109 women (mean age of 39.8 ± 8.7 years old) were included, 69.7% using a high dose LNG-IUS and 30.3% using a low dose LNG-IUS. Women with a low dose LNG-IUS were significantly younger, thinner, more nulliparous, with fewer vaginal deliveries and C-sections, with a lower menstrual flow length and with more previous use of short-acting reversible contraceptives (p &lt; 0.05). LNG-IUS continuation was similar and very high at the last follow-up: 100 vs. 94.7% in the low and high dose LNG-IUS groups, respectively (p = 0.18). Satisfaction with treatment at the end of the study was similar between different LNG-IUS doses (p = 0.85), with 78.9% being satisfied/very satisfied. Bleeding patterns were significantly different between the two LNG-IUS doses (p &lt; 0.0001). Diagnosis of dysfunctional cysts was more frequent in women with high dose compared to low dose LNG-IUS (22.2 vs. 12.1%), albeit not significantly. Conclusions: We have shown a clear differential use of available LNG-IUS in clinical practice, both as baseline characteristics and as different outcomes, primarily for bleeding patterns. However, all these systems were associated with a very high rate of satisfaction and continuation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Understanding influences on women’s preferred delivery mode is vital for planning interventions to reduce cesarean rates and for ensuring that women receive correct information. Our objectives were to: determine if sources of information influencing a pregnant woman’s preferred delivery mode and knowledge of cesarean indications differ by sociodemographic characteristics; to conduct a factor analysis of items related to information sources influencing this preference; and to determine if knowledge differs by information sources influencing this preference or their underlying latent constructs. Methods: Data from a prospective cohort study conducted in Buenos Aires was analyzed. Healthy nulliparous women aged 18-35, at &gt; 32 weeks of gestation and with live, singleton pregnancies participated. The primary research questions were evaluated using Chi-square tests, factor analysis, logistic regression, and generalized estimating equations. Results: A total of 382 women participated in the study. Women of lower socioeconomic status were more influenced by people, magazines and TV/movies in their mode of delivery preferences, and had poorer knowledge of cesarean indications. Sources of influence for preferred delivery mode and factors derived in factor analysis were not associated with knowledge level when considered individually or together, or when adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, or when accounting for clustering by the hospital sector (public or private). Conclusions: Higher socioeconomic status is associated with being less influenced by people and with better knowledge of indications for cesarean delivery. Knowledge of cesarean indications was not associated with the source of information about mode of delivery preferences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Mode of delivery at first childbirth largely determines mode of delivery at subsequent births, so it is particularly important to understand risk factors for cesarean delivery at first childbirth. In this study, we investigated risk factors for cesarean delivery among nulliparous women, with focus on the association between labor induction and cesarean delivery. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 2851 nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies who attempted vaginal delivery at hospitals in Pennsylvania, 2009-2011, was conducted. We used nested logistic regression models and multiple mediational analyses to investigate the role of three groups of variables in explaining the association between labor induction and unplanned cesarean delivery—the confounders of maternal characteristics and indications for induction, and the mediating (intrapartum) factors—including cervical dilatation, labor augmentation, epidural analgesia, dysfunctional labor, dystocia, fetal intolerance of labor, and maternal request of cesarean during labor. Results: More than a third of the women were induced (34.3%) and 24.8% underwent cesarean delivery. Induced women were more likely to deliver by cesarean (35.9%) than women in spontaneous labor (18.9%), unadjusted OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.97-2.79). The intrapartum factors significantly mediated the association between labor induction and cesarean delivery (explaining 76.7% of this association), particularly cervical dilatation &lt; 3 cm at hospital admission, fetal intolerance of labor, and dystocia. The indications for labor induction only explained 6.2%. Conclusions: Increased risk of cesarean delivery after labor induction among nulliparous women is attributable mainly to lower cervical dilatation at hospital admission and higher rates of labor complications.

        <ab>Objective: The aim of the study was to better understand the relationship between pain during intrauterine device (IUD) insertion and anxiety, negative perceptions of IUDs and previous mode of delivery, in parous women. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study between June and September 2018 in 210 women who opted for IUD placement for contraception. Sixty-six women who had previously had only vaginal delivery under epidural analgesia were allocated to the epidural delivery group; 60 women who had previously had at least one vaginal delivery without epidural analgesia were allocated to the vaginal delivery group; and 84 women who had previously had only caesarean delivery were allocated to the caesarean delivery group. Participants’ levels of anxiety before insertion were measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory; participants’ levels of pain (anticipated pain and pain at the various stages of IUD insertion and 15 min after the procedure) were assessed using a visual analogue scale. Results: While the experience of caesarean delivery and pre-procedure anxiety were found to be associated with higher pain scores, the presence of negative perceptions of IUDs was the most significant predictor of pain during IUD insertion (p &lt; .001). Experience of vaginal delivery under epidural analgesia was associated with lower pain scores at IUD insertion (p &lt; .001). Conclusion: Fear of IUD insertion pain, pre-procedure anxiety and negative perceptions of IUDs may lead women to anticipate or feel a higher level of pain. Patient education to correct negative perceptions of IUDs and counselling to inform women of the true benefits and risks of IUDs and lower pre-procedure anxiety are a suggested strategy to manage IUD insertion pain in parous women.

        <ab>Background: High stress prenatally contributes to poor maternal and infant well-being. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created substantial stress for pregnant women. Purpose To understand whether stress experienced by women pregnant at the beginning of the pandemic was associated with a greater prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Methods: Pregnant women across the USA aged ≥18 years old enrolled in a prospective cohort study during the pandemic onset (T1) in April–May 2020. This report focuses on the 1,367 participants who gave birth prior to July–August 2020 (T2). Hierarchical logistic regression models predicted preterm birth, small for gestational age infants, and unplanned operative delivery from T1 stress, sociodemographic, and medical factors. Results: After controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors, preterm birth was predicted by high prenatal maternal stress, delivering an infant small for gestational age was predicted by interpersonal violence and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic, and unplanned cesarean or operative vaginal delivery was predicted by prenatal appointment alterations, experiencing a major stressful life event, and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic. Independent of these associations, African American women were more likely than other groups to deliver preterm. Conclusion: Pregnant women who are experiencing high stress during the COVID-19 pandemic are at risk of poorer perinatal outcomes. A longitudinal investigation is critical to determine whether prenatal maternal stress and resulting outcomes have longer-term consequences for the health and well-being of children born in the midst of the current pandemic. Pregnant women who experienced greater stress during the COVID-19 pandemic onset were more likely to have a preterm birth, to deliver a small-for-gestational-age infant, and to have an unplanned operative delivery.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate risk factors for childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder (CR-PTSD) measured 1-month after first childbirth, and the association between CR-PTSD and maternal-infant bonding. Methods: In this prospective cohort study 3006 nulliparous women living in Pennsylvania, USA, were asked about CR-PTSD at 1-month postpartum, and maternal-infant bonding at 1, 6 and 12-months postpartum. Multivariable logistic regression models identified risk factors for CR-PTSD and associations between CR-PTSD and maternal-infant bonding at 1, 6 and 12-months postpartum, controlling for confounding variables - including postpartum depression, stress and social support. Results: Nearly half (47.5%) of the women reported that during labor and delivery they were afraid that they or their baby might be hurt or die, and 225 women (7.5%) reported experiencing one or more CR-PTSD symptoms at 1-month postpartum. Depression, stress and low social support during pregnancy were associated with CR-PTSD, as well as labor induction, delivery complications, poor pain control, and unplanned cesarean delivery. Women with CR-PTSD reported a less positive childbirth experience, less shared decision-making, and were more likely to score in the bottom third on maternal-infant bonding at 1-month postpartum (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.5, 95% CI 1.8–3.3, p &lt; 0.001); at 6-months postpartum (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5–2.8, p &lt; 0.001); and at 12-months postpartum (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6–3.0, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: In this large-scale prospective cohort study we found that CR-PTSD was consistently associated with lower levels of maternal-infant bonding over the course of the first year after first childbirth.

        <ab>Background: Previous studies have indicated that mode of delivery could have a negative effect on bonding. Aims: To assess feelings towards newborn infants in mothers who delivered by cesarean delivery, elective (ElCD) or emergency (EmCD). Study design: This observational prospective study took place at the Division of Perinatal Medicine, Policlinico Abano Terme, Abano Terme, Italy, from September 2014 to April 2015. Subjects: The sample included 573 puerperae divided into three groups: women undergone ElCD (n = 73; 12.73%), women undergone EmCD (n = 81; 14.13%) and women who underwent vaginal delivery (VD) (n = 419; 73.12%). Outcome measures: The instrument used was the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS; Taylor et al., 2005), a self-report test to measure mother's feelings towards her baby. High scores indicate worse mother-to-infant bonding and a score ≥ 2, established as cut-off, indicates an altered bonding. Results: The mean MIBS global score was 0.50 ± 1.05 in the VD mothers, 0.67 (±1.14) for ElCD mothers and 0.92 (±1.05) for EmCD mothers, resulting significantly higher in EmCD mothers (p &lt; 0.001). The percentage of altered bonding (Score ≥ 2) in the three groups was of 11.21% (n = 47) in VD, 17.80% (n = 13) in ElCD and 23.45% (n = 19) in EmCD, significantly higher in EmCD women (p &lt; 0.006). In addition, EmCD mothers scored significantly higher Joyful (0.074 ± 0.26 vs 0.185 ± 0.39; p &lt; 0.005) and Disappointed (0.063 ± 0.25 vs 0.123 ± 0.36; p &lt; 0.008) subscales. Conclusions: It was found that EmCD negatively affects mother bonding and opening emotions, and originates in mother feelings like sadness and disappointment for the unplanned delivery evolution.

        <ab>Introduction: Several factors are implicated in the women's sexuality after childbirth. Nevertheless, there is conflicting evidence about the influence of mode of delivery (MD). Aim: To prospectively evaluate the relationship between MD and sexual health outcomes after childbirth. Methods: A prospective cohort study conducted between May 2005 and March 2007 included 831 pregnant women recruited from primary care clinics of the public sector in São Paulo, Brazil. The exposure variable was MD: uncomplicated vaginal delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery without episiotomy or any kind of perineal laceration); complicated vaginal delivery (either forceps or normal, with episiotomy or any kind of perineal laceration) and cesarean delivery. Socio‐demographic and obstetric data were obtained through a questionnaire applied during the antenatal and postnatal period. Crude and adjusted risk ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using Poisson regression to examine the associations between MD and sexual health outcomes. Main Outcome Measures: The three main sexual health outcomes were later resumption of sexual life, self‐perception of decline of sexual life (DSL), and presence of sexual desire. Results: One hundred and forty‐one women (21.9%) resumed sexual life 3 or more months after delivery. Although 87.1% of women had desire, DSL occurred in 21.1% of the cohort. No associations were found between MD and sexual health outcomes. Conclusions: Women's sexuality after childbirth were not influenced by the type of delivery. Efforts to improve the treatment of sexual problems after childbirth should focus beyond MD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aim and objective: To assess mothers’ learning needs and concerns after giving birth and to examine whether these needs were met at 6–8 weeks postpartum. Background: Women experience many physiologic and psychological changes during postpartum period, which is considered a vital transitional time. Exploring and meeting women’s needs help woman to pass this period with little complications and enhance healthcare provider’s ability to provide appropriate care following childbirth. Design: A prospective cohort design was employed in this study. Methods: A prospective cohort design was employed. A convenience sample of 150 postpartum women have completed perceived leaning needs scale prior to hospital discharge, at southern region of Jordan, and have completed perceived met learning needs scale at 6–8 weeks after giving birth. Results: Women reported a high level of concern across all eight learning needs subscales. The most common concerns were related to new baby care, episiotomy care and breastfeeding. At 6–8 weeks postpartum, the primary unmet learning needs postpartum were danger signs post-Caesarean section, physical changes, breastfeeding and new baby care. Attending postpartum check-up clinic was found as a significant predictor for postpartum meeting women’s needs, particularly emotional changes and family planning-related information. Conclusions: The current maternal health services are not at the optimum level to meet women’s individual needs and concerns, which could increase the risk for postpartum complications. Some women’s characteristics, such as employment status and educational level, have increased women’s concerns and unmet needs in some of the learning needs. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare providers and policymakers should consider women’s concerns and needs at early postpartum period to establish patient-centred postpartum care that is based on women’s needs and concerns during this transitional period, with a focus on newborn baby care, episiotomy care and breastfeeding.

        <ab>A comparative, prospective cohort study compared PTSD symptoms in four groups of women at three times after childbirth: 5, 8 and 26 weeks. Two groups considered at-risk for PTSD were included (i.e., women giving birth to a LBW infant requiring NICU admission, and those who experienced an EmCB) and two low-risk groups (i.e., women who had a vaginal birth (VB) and those who had a planned caesarean birth (PCB)). This study examined four main hypotheses. We expected that: 1) at each time women in the two at-risk groups would experience greater PTSD symptoms compared to women in the low-risk groups, 2) the decrease in mean PTSD symptom levels for at-risk groups would be less than in the low-risk groups from 5 to 8, and 8 to 26 weeks postpartum, 3) the at-risk groups would have poorer maternal interactive behavior compared low-risk groups; and 4) regardless of group, women with clinically important PTSD symptom levels (e.g., scores in the clinical range) would exhibit poorer interactive behavior compared to women without; and women with co-morbidity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, would also have poorer interactive behavior. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted. Associations between PTSD symptoms and interactive behaviors were examined. The proportion of women in the clinical range in the different groups was explored. Lastly, we also investigated the proportion of women who had symptom levels in the clinical range on the self-report measure of PTSD compared to the more rigorous structured interview; and the concordance between these two measures with respect to classification of women in the clinical range.

        <ab>Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in 1–7% of women following childbirth. While having a caesarean section (C-section) is known to be a significant risk factor for postpartum PTSD, it is currently unknown whether coexisting anaesthesia-related factors are also associated to the disorder. The aim of this study was to assess anaesthesia-linked factors in the development of acute postpartum PTSD. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study on women having a C-section in a tertiary hospital in Switzerland. Patients were followed up six weeks postpartum. Patient and procedure characteristics, past morbidity or traumatic events, psychosocial status and stressful perinatal events were measured. Outcome was divided into two categories: full PTSD disease and PTSD profile. This was based on the number of DSM-IV criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) present. The PTSD Checklist Scale and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale were used for measurement. Results: Of the 280 patients included, 217 (77.5%) answered the questionnaires and 175 (62.5%) answered to an additional phone interview. Twenty (9.2%) had a PTSD profile and six (2.7%) a PTSD. When a full predictive model of risk factors for PTSD profile was built using logistic regression, maternal prepartum and intrapartum complications, anaesthetic complications and dissociative experiences during C-section were found to be the significant predictors for PTSD profile. Conclusion: This is the first study to show in parturients having a C-section that an anaesthesia complication is an independent risk factor for postpartum PTSD and PTSD profile development, in addition to known perinatal and maternal risk factors.

        <ab>Background: Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) is one of the post-surgical complications of a Cesarean section. Despite the high rates of Cesarean section worldwide, the incidence of CPSP and the risk factors for this condition remain relatively unknown. The objective of this study was to calculate the incidence of CPSP in women submitted to Cesarean section and to analyze the associated risk factors. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort of 621 women undergoing Cesarean section was recruited preoperatively. Potential presurgical (sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle-related characteristics) and post-surgical risk factors (the presence and intensity of pain) risk factors were analyzed. Pain was measured at 24 hours and 7, 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery. Following discharge from hospital, data were collected by telephone. The outcome measure was self-reported pain three months after a Cesarean section. The risk factors for chronic pain were analyzed using the log-binomial regression model (a generalized linear model). Results: A total of 462 women were successfully contacted 90 days following surgery. The incidence of CPSP was 25.5% (95%CI: 21.8–29.7). Risk factors included presurgical anxiety (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.03; 95%CI: 1.01–1.05), smoking (adjusted RR 2.22; 95%CI: 1.27–3.88) and severe pain in the early postoperative period (adjusted RR 2.79; 95%CI: 1.29–6.00). Conclusion: One in four women submitted to Cesarean section may develop CPSP; however, the risk factors identified here are modifiable and preventable. Preventive strategies directed towards controlling anxiety, reducing smoking during pregnancy and managing pain soon after hospital discharge are recommended.

        <ab>Although many women experience depressive symptoms during the first year after childbirth, the relationship between type of delivery and maternal depression is not clear. The purpose of this study is to evaluate relationship between type of delivery and maternal depression, between 6 to 16 months after childbirth. We performed a prospective cohort study of 558 low–socioeconomic status pregnant women without depression. All participants were recruited from primary care clinics of the public sector in three administrative districts in the Western area of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Type of delivery was classified as uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery (UVD) (no episiotomy and no more than a first-degree perineal laceration), complicated vaginal delivery (CVD) (episiotomy or more than a second-degree perineal laceration), and cesarean delivery (CD). Data about type of delivery were extracted from medical charts. Crude and adjusted risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance estimates to examine the association between type of delivery with maternal depression. Among 482 women reassessed during 6 to 16 months after delivery, 18% had symptoms of depression. According to the type of delivery, 250 (51.8%), 85 (21.7%), and 147 (30.5%) were UVD, CVD, and CD, respectively. There was no association between type of delivery and maternal depression. In comparison with women submitted to uncomplicated vaginal, women who had a cesarean or perineal trauma/episiotomy did not show greater risk of maternal depression, in the medium to long term after delivery.

        <ab>This study aimed to identify factors associated with birth-related post-traumatic stress symptoms during the early postnatal period. Secondary analysis was conducted using data from a prospective cohort study of 1824 women who gave birth in one large hospital in England. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured by the Impact of Event Scale at 6 to 8 weeks postpartum. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were developed for analyses. Results showed that post-traumatic stress symptoms were more frequently observed in black women and in women who had a higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared to those with a lower BMI. Women who have a history of mental illness as well as those who gave birth before arriving at the hospital, underwent an emergency caesarean section or experienced severe maternal morbidity or neonatal complications also showed symptoms. Women’s perceived control during labour and birth significantly reduced the effects of some risk factors. A higher level of perceived social support during the postnatal period also reduced the risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms. From the perspective of clinical practice, improving women’s sense of control during labour and birth appears to be important, as does providing social support following the birth.

        <ab>Background: Rates of cesarean delivery continue to increase among Hispanics, the largest minority group in the United States. Prior studies of the relationship between physical activity and cesarean delivery have been conflicting, limited by questionnaires not validated for pregnancy, and conducted primarily among non-Hispanic whites. Methods: We evaluated this association among participants (n = 1313) in Proyecto Buena Salud, a prospective cohort of Hispanic women conducted from 2006 to 2011. Physical activity was measured via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results: In total, 320 (24.4%) participants delivered via cesarean. In multivariable analyses, increasing levels of sedentary activity in mid/late pregnancy were associated with higher odds of cesarean delivery (odds ratio = 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–3.33; Ptrend = .05); however, there were no clear patterns between physical activity and cesarean delivery. When we repeated the analysis excluding planned cesarean deliveries (n = 126), high levels of prepregnancy moderate-intensity physical activity (odds ratio = 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.38–0.99) and increasing moderate-intensity physical activity in mid/late pregnancy (Ptrend = .03) were associated with reduction in odds. Increasing levels of household/caregiving physical activity in pre and mid/late pregnancy were associated with a 50% reduction in odds (Ptrend &lt; .05). Conclusions: In this prospective cohort of Hispanics, sedentary activity increased odds of cesarean delivery, and moderate-intensity and household/caregiving physical activity reduced odds of unplanned cesarean deliveries.

        <ab>This study investigates the prevalence of eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, neuropsychological function, structural brain correlates and risk mechanisms in a prospective cohort of very preterm (VPT) young adults. We assessed ED psychopathology and neuropsychological correlates in 143 cohort individuals born at &lt; 33 weeks of gestation. Structural brain correlates and risk factors at birth, in childhood and adolescence, were investigated using prospectively collected data throughout childhood/adolescence. VPT‐born individuals had high levels of ED psychopathology at age 21 years. Executive function did not correlate with ED symptomatology. VPT adults presenting with ED psychopathology had smaller grey matter volume at age 14/15 years in the left posterior cerebellum and smaller white matter volume in the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, compared with VPT adults with no ED psychopathology. Caesarean delivery predicted engaging in compensatory behaviours, and severe eating difficulty at age 14 years predicted ED symptomatology in young adulthood. VPT individuals are at risk for ED symptomatology, with evidence of associated structural alterations in posterior brain regions. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify the pathways that lead from perinatal/obstetric complications to ED and relevant neurobiological mechanisms.

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to evaluate which mode of birth first-time mothers in Germany and in the USA prefer and how this desire is related to maternal well-being and sense of coherence. The paper describes emotional well-being postpartum in relationship to mode of birth. For data collection a prospective cohort study was conducted in both countries. A self-administered questionnaire including validated instruments (WHO-5 Well-Being Index, Sense of Coherence Scale and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) was used. Results showed that only a few of the pregnant women in Germany and the USA preferred to deliver by caesarean section. There was a relationship between women's well-being, women's sense of coherence and the preferred mode of birth. The majority of women who wanted a caesarean section delivered in this way. No relationship was found between women's well-being and the type of birth experienced. Well-being in both samples generally decreased after giving birth, but there was a difference between German and American first-time mothers on the postpartum well-being and depression scores. German mothers had a higher postnatal quality of life and lower postnatal depression scores. To give families the opportunity for a healthy start, midwives and obstetricians should try to enhance women's well-being and they should give some thought to health professionals' decision-making processes. Expanded postpartum care might have an impact on women's depression scores. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: The rate of cesarean section (CS) for non-medical reasons has risen and it is a concern for health care. Women’s preferences may vary across countries for psychosocial or obstetric reasons. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 6549 women in routine antenatal care giving birth in Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway or Sweden. Preference for mode of birth was self-reported in mid-pregnancy. Birth outcome data were collected from hospital records. Results: A CS was preferred by 3.5% of primiparous women and 8.7% of the multiparous women. Preference for CS was associated with severe fear of childbirth (FOC), with a negative birth experience in multiparous women and with depressive symptoms in the primiparous. Women were somewhat more prone to prefer a cesarean in Iceland, odd ratio (OR) 1.70 (1.02–2.83), adjusted for age, education, depression, FOC, history of abuse, previous cesarean and negative birth experience. Out of the 404 women who preferred CS during pregnancy, 286 (70.8%) delivered by CS, mostly for a medical indication. A total of 9% of the cesareans in the cohort had a non-medical indication only. Conclusions: Women’s preference for CS often seems to be due to health concerns. Both medical and psychological factors need to be addressed in antenatal counseling. Obstetricians need to convey accurately to women the risks and benefits of CS in her specific case. Maternity professionals should identify and explore psychosocial reasons for women’s preferences.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the maternal and neonatal factors associated with offspring adiposity and the role of birth and placental weight as potential mediators in such associations. Design: The Tasmanian Infant Health Survey was a prospective cohort study conducted between 1988 and 1995 in Australia to investigate the cause of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This large infant cohort provides measurement of skinfolds on 7945 mothers and their offspring. Subjects: Participants included singletons born ≥ 37 weeks gestation who were at high risk of sudden infant death syndrome identified through a composite score that included birth weight, maternal age, neonatal gender, season of birth, duration of second-stage labor and intention to breast feed. Measurements: Neonatal adiposity was assessed from skinfold measurements of the subscapular (SSF) and triceps folds (TSF) taken at birth. Maternal early-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Neonatal data were extracted from birth records. Data relating to other environmental exposures were obtained from questionnaires administered when neonates were ∼ 4-days old. Results: In multivariable models, higher maternal adiposity, increasing maternal age, gestation age, delivery by Caesarian section and female gender were associated with larger SSF independent of placental and birth weight (P &lt; 0.001). Maternal age and delivery by Caesarian section were significantly associated with larger TSF, whereas gestational age and male gender were associated with thinner TSF independent of placental and birth weight. Higher early-pregnancy BMI, maternal weight gain, maternal age, parity and gestational age were significantly associated with larger placental and birth weight. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with smaller birth weight but not with placental weight. Conclusion: In addition to birth weight, maternal adiposity and placental weight were important additional factors associated with neonatal adiposity.

        <ab>Background: To describe prospectively the extent, onset, and persistence of maternal physical health symptoms (cesarean delivery pain, perineal pain, back pain, constipation, hemorrhoids, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, and fatigue) in the first 8 weeks postpartum. Methods: A prospective cohort of 229 primiparous women was recruited antenatally from a public and a private maternity hospital, Melbourne, Australia, between 2009 and 2011. Data were collected by self-report questionnaires at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. Main outcome measures were a checklist of maternal health symptoms and a standardized assessment of fatigue symptoms. Results: Birth-related pain was common at week 1 (n = 80/88, 91% cesarean delivery pain; n = 92/125, 74% perineal pain), and still present for one in five women who had a cesarean birth (n = 17, 18%) at week 8. Back pain was reported by approximately half the sample at each study interval, with 25 percent (n = 48) reporting a later onset at week 2 or beyond. Fatigue was not relieved between 4 and 8 weeks. Conclusions: Women experience significant morbidity in the early weeks postpartum, the extent of which may have been underestimated in previous research relying on retrospective recall. Findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that supports early identification, treatment, and support for women’s physical health problems in the postpartum.

        <ab>Abstract Background Perineal trauma after vaginal delivery can have significant long‐term consequences. It is unknown if a larger infant head circumference or smaller maternal perineal anatomy are risk factors for perineal trauma after vaginal delivery. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of low‐risk nulliparous women. Data collected included maternal characteristics, antepartum Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification measurements of the perineal body and genital hiatus, labor characteristics, perineal trauma, and infant head circumference. Perineal trauma was defined as trauma that extended into the muscles of the perineum (second‐degree or deeper). Univariate and multivariate logistic models were created to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI). Results We observed 448 vaginal births. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between infant head circumference at birth and perineal trauma: OR 1.22 for each increase of 1 cm in head circumference (95% CI 1.05–1.43). There was no association between perineal body or genital hiatus length and perineal trauma. Conclusions In nulliparous low‐risk women a larger infant head circumference at birth increases the likelihood of perineal trauma, although the effect is modest. Antenatal perineal body and genital hiatus measurements do not predict perineal trauma. These results do not support alteration in mode of delivery or other obstetric practices.

        <ab>Background: Although epidural analgesia is widespread and very effective for alleviating labor pain, its use is still controversial, as the literature is inconsistent about the risk of adverse birth outcome after administration of epidural analgesia. The aim of this study was to explore associations between epidural analgesia and mode of delivery. Methods: Data were obtained from a prospective cohort from nine Danish labor wards and comprised 2,721 term nulliparous women with spontaneous onset of labor and a singleton fetus in cephalic presentation. Information about epidural analgesia, mode of delivery, and birth complications was obtained by the staff attending labor. Additional information was provided from self-administered questionnaires in gestational week 37. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between epidural analgesia and birth outcomes. Results are presented as crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR [95% CI]). Results: Of the total cohort, 21.6 percent required epidural analgesia, 8.7 percent had emergency cesarean section, and 14.9 percent had vacuum extraction. Women with epidural analgesia had a higher risk of emergency cesarean section (adjusted OR: 5.8; 95% CI: 4.1–8.1), and vacuum extraction (adjusted OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3–2.2). In a subgroup of the cohort with a very low overall risk of cesarean section, 3.4 percent had emergency cesarean section and an increased risk of emergency cesarean section was also found in this group (adjusted OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.5–8.2). Conclusions: In nulliparous women of a very low-risk population, use of epidural analgesia for labor pain was associated with higher risks of emergency cesarean section and vacuum extraction.

        <ab>Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) can result in negative personal and child developmental outcomes. Only a few large population-based studies of PPD have used clinical diagnoses of depression and no study has examined how a maternal depression history interacts with known risk factors. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of a depression history on PPD and pre- and perinatal risk factors. Methods: A nationwide prospective cohort study of all women with live singleton births in Sweden from 1997 through 2008 was conducted. Relative risk (RR) of clinical depression within the first year postpartum and two-sided 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Results: The RR of PPD in women with a history of depression was estimated at 21.03 (confidence interval: 19.72–22.42), compared to those without. Among all women, PPD risk increased with advanced age (1.25 (1.13–1.37)) and gestational diabetes (1.70 (1.36–2.13)). Among women with a history of depression, pregestational diabetes (1.49 (1.01–2.21)) and mild preterm delivery also increased risk (1.20 (1.06–1.36)). Among women with no depression history, young age (2.14 (1.79–2.57)), undergoing instrument-assisted (1.23 (1.09–1.38)) or cesarean (1.64(1.07– 2.50)) delivery, and moderate preterm delivery increased risk (1.36 (1.05–1.75)). Rates of PPD decreased considerably after the first postpartum month (RR = 0.27). Conclusion: In the largest population-based study to date, the risk of PPD was more than 20 times higher for women with a depression history, compared to women without. Gestational diabetes was independently associated with a modestly increased PPD risk. Maternal depression history also had a modifying effect on pre- and perinatal PPD risk factors.

        <ab>Aim: To identify maternal and infantile factors affecting intention to breastfeed, early weaning and duration of breastfeeding. Design/subjects: In a prospective cohort study, 1049 mothers were interviewed after delivery and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-partum. Results: Of 1049 mothers, 942 (89.7%) intended to breastfeed. Negative attitude was associated with lack of breastfeeding previous offspring, multiparity, admission to neonatal ward, tobacco use, prematurity and male gender (OR: 10.1, 2.67, 3.02, 2.63, 2.40 and 1.54, respectively). Six hundred and twenty-three mothers (60.7%) were breastfeeding at month 1. Early weaning was associated with lack of breastfeeding previous offspring, tobacco use, prematurity, admission to neonatal ward, caesarean section (OR: 12.3, 3.39, 2.33, 2.22, 1.34), low education (p &lt; 0.0001) and young age (p = 0.034). Factors negatively affecting total duration of breastfeeding included lack of breastfeeding previous offspring (3.91 vs. 16.2 weeks, p &lt; 0.001), tobacco use (6.78 vs. 15.9 weeks, p &lt; 0.001), low education (p &lt; 0.001), early re-employment (12.5 vs. 15.1 weeks, p &lt; 0.01) and prematurity (p &lt; 0.005). Conclusion: Maternal negative attitude, tobacco use and early re-employment are factors negatively affecting breastfeeding that can be liable to intervention. All health professionals involved in perinatal medicine share a part of responsibility in sustaining breastfeeding, particularly in high-risk groups of mothers.

        <ab>Objectives: To carry out an epidemiological analysis of the emerging epidemic in an Eastern European country and to compare the approach to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) with that in Western Europe. Design: Prospective cohort study established in 1985 in Western Europe and extended to Ukraine in 2000. Methods: Data on 5967 HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants (1251 from Ukraine and 4716 from Western/Central Europe) was analysed. Factors associated with transmission were identified with logistic regression. Results: HIV-infection among pregnant women enrolled in Western European centres has shifted from being largely injecting drug use (IDU)-related to heterosexually-acquired; in Ukraine IDU also gradually declined with women increasingly identified without specific risk factors. In Ukraine in 2000-2004 most (80%) women received single dose nevirapine (sdNVP) and/or short-course zidovudine prophylaxis [MTCT rate 4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.8-8.0 for sdNVP with short-course zidovudine]; 2% (n = 27) received antenatal HAART and 33% (n = 418) delivered by elective caesarean section (CS); in Western European centres 72% of women received HAART (MTCT rate 1.0%; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9) and 66% delivered by elective CS during the same period. Conclusions: Our findings indicate distinct differences in the epidemics in pregnant women across Europe. The evolution of the MTCT epidemic in Ukraine does not appear to be following the same pattern as that in Western Europe in the 1980s and 1990s. Although uptake of preventive MTCT prophylaxis has been rapid in both Western Europe and Ukraine, substantial challenges remain in the more resource-constrained setting in Eastern Europe.

        <ab>This French multicenter prospective cohort study recruited 391 patients to investigate the risk factors for persistent pain after elective cesarean delivery, focusing on psychosocial aspects adjusted for other known medical factors. Perioperative data were collected and specialized questionnaires were completed to assess reports of pain at the site of surgery. Three dependent outcomes were considered: pain at the third month after surgery (M3, n = 268; risk = 28%), pain at the sixth month after surgery (M6, n = 239; risk = 19%), and the cumulative incidence (up to M6) of neuropathic pain, as assessed using the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire (n = 218; risk = 24.5%). The neuropathic aspect of reported pain changed over time in more than 60% of cases, pain being more intense if associated with neuropathic features. Whatever the dependent outcome, a high mental component of quality of life (SF-36) was protective. Pain at M3 was also predicted by pain reported during current pregnancy and a history of miscarriage. Pain at M6 was also predicted by report of a postoperative complication. Incident neuropathic pain was predicted by pain reported during current pregnancy, a previous history of a peripheral neuropathic event, and preoperative anxiety. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00812734. Perspective: Persistent pain after cesarean delivery has a relatively frequent neuropathic aspect but this is less stable than that after other surgeries. When comparing the risk factor analyses with published data for hysterectomy, the influence of preoperative psychological factors seems less important, possibly because of the different context and environment.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the association between maternal weight at &lt;17 weeks gestation and maternal and infant outcomes of pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period in pregnant Ghanaian women. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 1,000 women in Accra, Ghana (2012-2014), was conducted. Women were classified as having overweight (BMI 25-30) and obesity (BMI ≥30), and their obstetric and infant outcomes were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: The analysis included 824 women, average 28 years (SD 5.1); 313 (31.3%) had overweight and 169 (16.9%) obesity. Women with obesity had a two-fold increased risk for cesarean sections (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.21-4.02) and more than a six-fold higher risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension (RR 6.17, 95% CI 2.90-13.13) and chronic hypertension (RR 6.00, 95% CI 1.40-25.76). Infants of women with overweight or obesity were more likely to be macrosomic (RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.13-4.97). Conclusions: The global obesity epidemic has reached women in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) with important adverse consequences for maternal and infant health. Antenatal care in LMIC will need to anticipate this potential expansion of complications, including the development of guidelines for optimal maternity care for pregnant women with overweight and obesity.

        <ab>Background: Several studies reported that the mode of delivery may induce changes to the immune system. Our hypothesis was that the delivery mode may influence mainly the naive T cell subpopulation. Aims: Particular focus was set on the proportions and peripheral replicative history of naive T cells and cord blood serum concentrations of IL-7, a cytokine involved in peripheral naive T cell homeostasis. Study design, subjects and outcome measures: In a prospective cohort study, proportions of lymphocyte populations were measured in mothers and newborns delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery (SD), vacuum extraction (VE), primary (PCS) and secondary Cesarean sections (SCS) by flow cytometry. T-cell-receptor-excision-circles (TRECs) and relative telomere lengths (RTLs) were used to estimate the replicative history of peripheral naive T cells. The cytokine profile was assessed by ELISA. Results: The study demonstrated that leukocytes, neutrophils and NK cells were increased in spontaneously delivered newborns compared to PCS, whereas circulating T cells were relatively lower. TRECs and RTLs were not significantly influenced by the delivery mode. IL-2, IL-8 and IFN-γ were increased in VD. IL-7 production tends to be increased in more stress-associated delivery modes, such as VE and SCS. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate proportional changes in newborns delivered by PCS and diminished cytokine production. It has to be proven whether these alterations may be of disadvantage regarding early defense of infectious diseases. Understanding the physiological role of these changes may help to find preventive strategies for neonatal infectious risks and the development of atopy or other immune diseases.

        <ab>Aim: The number of older primiparas is increasing in Japan. These women have been shown to be more vulnerable to post‐partum depression. This study aimed to identify factors for predicting post‐partum depressive symptoms during hospitalization after childbirth in Japanese primiparas aged 35 years and over. Methods: The present authors used the data of 479 primiparas aged 35 years and over from a prospective cohort study. Data were collected using self‐report questionnaires on the day before hospital discharge. The questionnaire consisted of: demographics and background information; depressive symptoms; fatigue; maternal confidence and maternal satisfaction; child‐care values; physical symptoms; perceptions of daily life during hospitalization; concerns about child care and daily life; and infant feeding. Additionally, vital records data were obtained from the hospitals. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed on the binary outcome variable of depressive symptoms, measured by the Japanese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Women who scored 9 or more were considered to be at high risk for post‐partum depression. The authors obtained informed consent from all participants and institutional ethics approvals before initiating the study. Results: The following six variables reliably predicted the risk of post‐partum depression: emergency cesarean section, lower satisfaction with birth experience, higher physical burden in daily life, long‐term complications with the newborn, more concerns about newborn caretaking after discharge, and more concerns about one's own life after discharge. Conclusion: Recognition of women with these factors will help nurses to identify those at risk for developing post‐partum depression and to provide appropriate care during hospitalization after childbirth.

        <ab>To investigate the role of peripheral neuropathy in the development of neuropathic postsurgical persistent pain (N-PSPP) after surgery, this French multicentric prospective cohort study recruited 3,112 patients prior to elective cesarean, inguinal herniorrhaphy (open mesh/laparoscopic), breast cancer surgery, cholecystectomy, saphenectomy, sternotomy, thoracotomy, or knee arthroscopy. Besides perioperative data collection, postoperative postal questionnaires built to assess the existence, intensity, and neuropathic features (with the Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions [DN4]) of pain at the site of surgery were sent at the third and sixth months after surgery. In the 2,397 patients who completed follow-up, the cumulative risk of N-PSPP within the 6 months ranged from 3.2% (laparoscopic herniorrhaphy) to 37.1% (breast cancer surgery). Pain intensity was greater if DN4 was positive and decreased with time since surgery; it depended on the type of surgery. In pain-reporting patients, the response to the DN4 changed from time to time in about 1:4 of the cases. Older age and a low anxiety score were independent protective factors of N-PSPP, whereas a recent negative event, a low preoperative quality of life, and previous history of peripheral neuropathy were risk factors. The type of anesthesia had no influence on the occurrence of N-PSPP. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00812734. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: To date, most studies evaluating pain associated with cesarean birth have focused on delivery procedures or postoperative pain control methods rather than on the nature or severity of the pain experience of women, despite the increasing incidence and maternal requests for cesarean delivery. The objective in this study was to evaluate sensory, affective, and laterality aspects of pain after cesarean delivery and vaginal delivery. Methods: A prospective cohort study using a seven-item visual analog scale assessed pain at rest and with activity, and the unpleasantness and location of pain on postpartum days 1 and 2. Chart review identified demographic and clinical factors influencing pain. Multivariable regression and propensity score analyses were used to evaluate patient-level outcomes. Results: Of 126 consenting women, 48 underwent cesarean delivery and 78 had vaginal delivery. No statistically significant differences in pain at rest and pain unpleasantness were found between groups on postpartum day 1, but women undergoing cesarean delivery reported more pain with activity than those who had a vaginal delivery (p &lt; 0.0002). On postpartum day 2, cesarean delivery women reported significantly more pain when compared with those with a vaginal delivery (p &lt; 0.04), and more cesarean delivery women reported lateralized pain (p &lt; 0.0001). In multivariate regression analyses, cesarean delivery was the most significant predictor of activity-related pain on postpartum day 1 (p &lt; 0.00001), followed by current substance abuse (p &lt; 0.01). Women undergoing cesarean delivery required twice the dosage of analgesics on postpartum day 1 and four times greater amounts on postpartum day 2 relative to those with a vaginal delivery (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Cesarean delivery was associated with higher levels of pain, more unpleasant pain, more lateralized pain, and greater narcotic use than vaginal delivery. Evaluation of factors associated with postpartum pain can help practitioners to counsel women better about their delivery alternatives and can promote improved management of women undergoing both types of delivery experiences.

        <ab>Objective: To determine factors associated with active duty military women being within Navy weight standards 6 months following childbirth. Methods: Inclusion criteria for this study were active duty women who delivered a nonanomalous fetus at a Naval Hospital and who remained in the area and their weight was recorded 6 months following childbirth. Multivariate logistic regressions, adjusted for 14 covariates, determined the factors for achieving acceptable weight. Results: Among 1,009 women who participated in this prospective cohort study, 68% began within Navy body weight standards and 52% had a normal body mass index (BMI) (&lt;25). Six months after childbirth, 48% were within Navy body weight standards and 32% had a BMI &lt;25. Only 2 factors, BMI at first visit and cesarean delivery, significantly influenced the percentage of women who met the weight standards at 6 months. Conclusions: Lowering the prepregnancy BMI and avoiding a cesarean delivery may improve the percentage of active duty women who meet weight standards 6 months after childbirth.

        <ab>Objective: To systematically review the literature regarding safety of disease-modifying drug (DMD) use during pregnancy on perinatal and developmental outcomes in offspring of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: A PubMed and EMBASE search up to February 2012 was conducted with a manual search of references from relevant articles. Selected studies were evaluated using internationally accepted criteria. Results: Fifteen studies identified 761 interferon β-, 97 glatiramer acetate-, and 35 natalizumab-exposed pregnancies. Study quality ranged from poor to good; no study was rated excellent. Small sample sizes limited most studies. Compared with data for unexposed pregnancies, fair- to good-quality prospective cohort studies reported that interferon β exposure was associated with lower mean birth weight, shorter mean birth length, and preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks), but not low birth weight (&lt;2,500 g), cesarean delivery, congenital anomaly (including malformation), or spontaneous abortion. Fewer studies of fair quality were available for glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. Glatiramer acetate exposure was not associated with lower mean birth weight, congenital anomaly, preterm birth, or spontaneous abortion. Natalizumab exposure did not appear to be associated with shorter mean birth length, lower mean birth weight, or lower mean gestational age. No studies examined mitoxantrone or fingolimod exposure. One study of paternal DMD use during conception found no effect on gestational age or birth weight. Few studies examined longer-term developmental outcomes. Conclusion: Further studies are needed to determine the potential risks associated with preconceptional and in utero DMD exposure in patients with MS. Discontinuation of DMDs before conception is still recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Whether or not cesarean delivery is associated with increased risk of postpartum depression (PPD) remains unclear. Methods: We carried out a prospective cohort study between February and September 2007 in Hunan Maternal and Infant Hospital and the First Affiliated and Third Affiliated Hospitals of the Central South University in Changsha, Hunan, People’s Republic of China. The Chinese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used at 2 weeks postpartum to assess PPD, with a score of ≥ 13 as the cutoff for PPD. Results: A total of 534 women were included in the final analysis, with 415 (77.7%) delivering by cesarean section (the majority of them with no medical indication). The rate of PPD was 21.7% in women who had a cesarean delivery and 10.9% in women who delivered vaginally. The increased risk of PPD in women who had cesarean sections was maintained after we adjusted for potential confounding factors or considered cesarean delivery by social indications. Conclusions: Cesarean section is associated with increased risk of PPD in Chinese women with a high cesarean delivery rate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective is to examine the effect of epidural analgesia in first stage of labor on occurrence of cesarean and operative vaginal deliveries in nulliparous women and multiparous women without a previous cesarean delivery. Design of the Prospective cohort study. Prenatal care was received at 12 free-standing health centers, 7 private physician offices, or 2 hospital-based clinics; babies were delivered at a free standing birth center or at 3 hospitals, all in San Diego, CA. This study of 2,052 women used data from the San Diego Birth Center Study that enrolled women between 1994 and 1996 to compare the birthing management of the collaborative Certified Nurse Midwife-Medical Doctor Model with that of the traditional Medical Doctor Model. Main Outcome Measures of the Cesarean or operative vaginal deliveries. After adjusting for differences between women who used and those who did not use epidural analgesia in 1st stage of labor, epidural use was associated with a 2.5 relative risk (95% CI: 1.8, 3.4) for operative vaginal delivery in nulliparous women, and a 5.9 relative risk (95% CI: 3.2, 11.1) in multiparous women. Epidural use was associated with a 2.4 relative risk (95% CI: 1.5, 3.7) for cesarean delivery in nulliparous women, and a 1.8 relative risk (95% CI: 0.6, 5.3) in multiparous women. Epidural anesthesia increases the risk for operative vaginal deliveries in both nulliparous and multiparous women, and increases risk for cesarean deliveries in nulliparous more so than in multiparous women.

        <ab>Introduction: This study described anesthesia and analgesia–related preferences and outcomes of women who used a birth plan for labor and birth. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted (N = 63). Data were abstracted from medical records, birth plans, and a follow-up survey. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Results: Women who elected birth plans were primarily white, college-educated, primigravida, and under the care of a certified nurse-midwife. One-third of births were induced, 10% required instrumentation, and 29% were cesarean births. Nearly every birth was associated with at least 1 labor and birth complication, although most complications were minor. Analgesic preferences were reported to be the most important birth plan request. Greater than 50% of women requested to avoid epidural analgesia; however, 65% of women received epidural analgesia. On follow-up, greater than 90% of women who received epidural analgesia reported being pleased. The majority of women agreed that the birth plan enhanced their birth experiences, added control, clarified their thoughts, and improved communication with their health care providers. Discussion: Anesthesia and analgesia–related preferences were an important component of the birth plans. The majority of women favorably viewed the use of a birth plan, whether or not preferences were fulfilled or complications occurred. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To determine the factors that predict women's perceptions of the childbirth experience and to examine whether these vary with the type of birth a woman experiences. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: The postpartum units of two eastern Canadian hospitals. Participants: Six hundred fifty two women and their newborns. Data Collection: Data were collected in hospital at 12 to 48 hours postpartum using self-report questionnaires and chart review. Main Outcome Measure: Perception of the childbirth experience was measured for women having a vaginal and emergency cesarean birth using the Questionnaire Measuring Attitudes About Labor and Delivery and planned cesarean birth using the Modified Questionnaire Measuring Attitudes About Labor and Delivery. Results: Of the 20 predictors of women's childbirth perceptions, the strongest were type of birth; degree of awareness, relaxation, and control; helpfulness of partner support; and being together with the infant following birth. Conclusions: Of the predictors of a quality birth experience, most were amenable to nursing interventions: enhancement of patient awareness, relaxation, and control; promotion of partner support; and provision of immediate opportunities for women to be with their babies.

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the pregnancy outcome in pregnancies with threatened abortion (miscarriage). Material and method: A prospective cohort study was performed on 1000 pregnant women. 500 women (case group), had a history of vaginal bleeding during the first half of pregnancy and the other 500 women (control group), did not have this history. Both groups of women were monitored from 20 weeks of pregnancy up to delivery. Results: The women of the 2 groups did not have any significant differences according to age, parity or body mass index (BMI). Spontaneous preterm delivery [126 cases (25.2%) vs. 47 cases (9.4%), P = 0.001, adj RR = 1.4, CI 95% = 1.2–1.5], PROM [51 cases (10.2%) vs. 24 cases (4.8%), P = 0.02, adj RR = 2.1, CI95% = 1.2–2.3], placental abruption [20 cases (4%) vs. 7 cases (1.4%) P = 0.01, adj RR = 1.1, CI 95% = 1.01–1.2], were more in the case group. There were no differences between the 2 groups with regard to Preeclampsia, small for gestational age (SGA), and cesarean deliveries. Neonatal weight (in term pregnancies) in the case group was lower than in the control group (3046.4 ± 560.8 g vs. 3317.6 ± 432 g, P = 0.001). There was a significant relationship between the number of bleeding episodes, spontaneous preterm delivery and placental abruption and there was also a significant relationship between the amount of bleeding and placental abruption. Conclusion: Threatened abortion increases the rate of spontaneous preterm delivery, PROM and placental abruption, and decreases the neonatal weight. Therefore threatened abortion indicates a high risk pregnancy and, as such, demands more serious prenatal care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess the degree to which mothers' prepartum personality traits predict breastfeeding status at 6 months postpartum. Study design: This prospective cohort study is part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, conducted at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. A total of 27,753 mothers completed assessment of negative affectivity (NA) and general self-efficacy (GSE) at gestation weeks 17 and 30 and completed a questionnaire about infant feeding at 6 months postpartum. Feeding status was classified with a cutoff at 6 months in the categories of predominant breastfeeding, mixed breastfeeding, and bottle-feeding. Results: After adjusting for maternal smoking, age, education, cesarean section, preterm birth, primiparity, and external daycare, NA increased the odds of mixed breastfeeding (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.32) and bottle feeding (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.53) compared with predominant breastfeeding. GSE decreased the odds of bottle feeding (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.97) but not of mixed breastfeeding (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.04) compared with predominant breastfeeding. The adjusting variables were also predictors of breastfeeding behavior in their own right. Conclusions: Our results show that NA and GSE are important antenatal predictors of breastfeeding status at 6 months postpartum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess the effect of a woman's educational level on starting and continuing breastfeeding and to assess the role of sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, psychosocial, and birth characteristics in this association. Methods: We used the data of 2914 participants in a population-based prospective cohort study. Information on educational level, breastfeeding, sociodemographic (maternal age, single parenthood, parity, job status), lifestyle-related (BMI, smoking, alcohol use), psychosocial (whether the pregnancy was planned, stress), and birth (gestational age, birth weight, cesarean delivery, place and type of delivery) characteristics were obtained between pregnancy and 12 months postpartum. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of starting and continuing breastfeeding for educational level were obtained by logistic regression, adjusted for each group of covariates and for all covariates simultaneously. Results: Of 1031 highest-educated mothers, 985 (95.5%) started breastfeeding; the percentage was 73.1% (255 of 349) in the lowest-educated mothers. At 6 months, 39.3% (405 of 1031) of highest-educated mothers and 15.2% (53 of 349) of lowest-educated mothers were still breastfeeding. Educationally related differences were present in starting breastfeeding and the continuation of breastfeeding until 2 months but not in breastfeeding continuation between 2 and 6 months. Lifestyle-related and birth characteristics attenuated the association between educational level and breastfeeding, but the association was hardly affected by sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics. Conclusions: Decisions to breastfeed were underlain by differences in educational background. The underlying pathways require further research. For the time being, interventions on promoting breastfeeding should start early in pregnancy and should increase their focus on low-educated women.

        <ab>Purpose: Most new mothers return to work soon after childbirth. A need exists to reexamine the definition of postpartum health and evaluate employed women's recovery from childbirth in association with such factors as delivery type and breastfeeding. Methods: Using a prospective cohort design, we recruited Minnesota women into the study while they were hospitalized for childbirth in 2001. Telephone interviews were conducted 5 weeks postpartum. Eligible women were 18 years or older, employed, and spoke English. Multivariate models using 2-stage least squares were used to estimate factors associated with physical and mental health and postpartum symptoms. Results: A total of 817 women were enrolled (71% response) in the study; 716 women completed interviews at 5 weeks postpartum. On average, women reported 6 postpartum symptoms, most frequently fatigue (64%), breast discomfort (60%), and decreased desire for sex (52%). Findings showed that cesarean (vs vaginal) deliveries were associated with significantly worse physical function, role limitations, and vitality. Multivariate findings showed that the effect of delivery type on physical health was moderately large (β = -5.96; P = &lt; .01), and breastfeeding was associated with an increased frequency of postpartum symptoms (β = 4.63; P = .01). Conclusions: These mothers experienced several childbirth-related symptoms at 5 weeks postpartum, indicating a need for ongoing rest and recovery. Health concerns were greater for women who were breastfeeding and for those whose babies were delivered by cesarean section, suggesting a need for greater support for these women and a reassessment by the medical community of the progressively growing practice of cesarean deliveries.

        <ab>The purpose of this prospective cohort study of twins and triplets was to evaluate perinatal and early childhood outcomes through 18 months of age. The study population included 141 twin pregnancies (282 twin children) and 8 triplet pregnancies (24 triplet children) recruited between May, 1996 and June, 2001. Mothers of triplets versus twins were significantly more likely to have infertility treatments, to be overweight or obese before conception, to be admitted antenatally, and to deliver by cesarean section. Length of gestation for triplets was significantly shorter (-2.31 weeks, p &lt; .0001), and more likely to be less than 35 weeks (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 9.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.22-27.29). Average birthweight for triplets was significantly lighter (-495 grams, p &lt; .0001), and more likely to be low birthweight (AOR 11.38, 95% CI 3.11-41.61). Triplets were also more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (AOR 7.97, 95% CI 2.13-29.77), to require mechanical ventilation (AOR 5.67, 95% CI 2.05-15.65), to develop respiratory distress syndrome (AOR 12.50, 95% CI 3.89-40.20), or a major morbidity (retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, ventilator support, or grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage, AOR 5.67, 95% CI 2.05-15.65). Weight, length, and head circumference was significantly smaller at birth for triplets compared to twins, and these differences remained through 18 months of age, along with lower mental developmental scores at the oldest age. Compared to twins, triplets have greater neonatal morbidity, and through 18 months of age lower mental and motor scores, slower postnatal growth and more residual stunting, particularly of length and head circumference.

        <ab>Objective: To examine changes in health status among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). Methods: We examined perceived health status changes from the prepregnancy, as recalled at 12-20 weeks gestation, to the postpartum period in women with GDM (n = 64) vs. unaffected gravidas (n = 1233) and women diagnosed with PIH (n = 148) vs. unaffected gravidas. We used patient survey and medical record data from a prospective cohort study. Health status measures included the Short Form-36 scales for physical function, vitality, and self-rated health and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Multivariate logistic regression models controlled for age, parity, race, education, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and exercise levels, food insufficiency, and GDM or PIH during a prior pregnancy. Results: Women with PIH more often reported a significant decline in vitality (odds ratio [OR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.23) and self-rated health (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.19-3.77) and an increase in depressive symptoms from prepregnancy to postpartum compared with unaffected women (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.11-3.05). Decline in self-rated health was partially mediated by cesarean birth and preterm delivery. Similar proportions of women with GDM and unaffected women reported declines in health status measures. Conclusions: Women with PIH, but not GDM, more often experience significant declines in health status from prepregnancy to postpartum than unaffected women.

        <ab>Introduction Breastfeeding has significant health benefits for infants and birthing persons, including reduced risk of chronic disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for 6 months and recently extended its recommendation for continuing to breastfeed with supplementation of solid foods from one to two years. Studies consistently identify lower breastfeeding rates among US infants, with regional and demographic variability. We examined breastfeeding in birthing person-infant pairs among healthy, term pregnancies enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study between 2010 and 2017 (n = 1176). Methods Birthing persons 18–45 years old were enrolled during prenatal care visits at ~ 24–28 weeks gestation and have been followed since enrollment. Breastfeeding status was obtained from postpartum questionnaires. Birthing person and infant health and sociodemographic information was abstracted from medical records and prenatal and postpartum questionnaires. We evaluated the effects of birthing person age, education, relationship status, pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain (GWG), smoking and parity, and infant sex, ponderal index, gestational age and delivery mode on breastfeeding initiation and duration using modified Poisson and multivariable linear regression. Results Among healthy, term pregnancies, 96% of infants were breastfed at least once. Only 29% and 28% were exclusively breastfed at 6-months or received any breastmilk at 12-months, respectively. Higher birthing person age, education, and parity, being married, excessive GWG, and older gestational age at delivery were associated with better breastfeeding outcomes. Smoking, obesity, and cesarean delivery were negatively associated with breastfeeding outcomes. Conclusions Given the public health importance of breastfeeding for infants and birthing persons, interventions are needed to support birthing persons to extend their breastfeeding duration. Significance What is already known? The benefits of breastfeeding to child and birthing person health are well-documented, however, rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration continue to fall short of health-based guidelines. Regional differences exist and certain rural New England states tend to have amongst the highest breastfeeding rates in the US. What this study adds? This study of n = 1176 birthing persons-infant pairs enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, a rural, general population pregnancy cohort, suggests that factors influencing breastfeeding outcomes align closely with studies conducted in urban settings and using nationally-representative surveys.

        <ab>Aim: To evaluate whether pregnancy and birth‐related factors are associated with celiac disease (CD) in a large, United States (US)‐based mother‐child cohort. Methods: We analysed data gathering from the Massachusetts General Hospital Maternal Child Cohort (MMCC) of children born between 1998 and 2016. Data included the mode of delivery, maternal pregnancy and their offspring characteristics. We searched for CD cases by using diagnosis billing codes. Cox proportional hazard regression models were created to identify variables associated with CD. Results: We identified 44 539 mother‐child pairs who had at least one encounter by 5 years old and identified 173 children (0.4%) with CD diagnosis; median age at the diagnosis was 6 years. Overall, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of caesarean delivery for CD was 1.39 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.96, p = 0.06) when compared to children born vaginally. After stratifying for the presence of labour, children born by Caesarean delivery without labour had a higher risk of CD (aHR 1.56; 95%CI: 1.01, 2.41; p = 0.046) while infants born by Caesarean delivery with labour did not (aHR 1.26; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.93; p = 0.28). Conclusion: Being born by Caesarean delivery without labour may be associated with an increased risk for CD in the US children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective In-hospital formula supplementation places infants at risk for early breastfeeding cessation. The study’s aim was to identify predictive and protective factors for in-hospital formula supplementation in individuals documented as wanting to exclusively breastfeed and residing in a geographic region with adverse social determinants of health and low breastfeeding rates. Additionally, we wished to determine if lactation consultation served as a protective factor against supplementation. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we retrospectively reviewed 500 randomly selected charts of newborns born in a 12 month period at a regional tertiary care hospital. We included healthy, full-term neonates having a recorded maternal decision to exclusively breastfeed. Maternal-newborn dyad characteristics were compared between those exclusively breastfeeding and those with in-hospital formula supplementation. Results Of the 500 charts, 70% of individuals desired to exclusively breastfeed. Overall, 41% of breastfed newborns were supplemented with formula before discharge, and 32% of women met with lactation consultants prior to supplementation. No statistically significant association was present between exclusive breastfeeding at discharge and meeting with a hospital lactation consultant (p = 0.55). When controlling for the confounders of maternal demographics and lactation consultation, significant associations with formula supplementation included Cesarean delivery (odd ratio: 2.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.04–4.16), primiparity (2.48, 1.27–4.87), and high school level of education (2.78, 1.33–5.78). Conclusions Maternal characteristics of high school level educational, primiparity, and Caesarean delivery place individuals at risk for in-hospital formula supplementation in individuals wishing to exclusively breastfeed. Addressing barriers to exclusive breastfeeding is essential to enhance maternal and newborn health equity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The placenta acts as a buffer to regulate the degree of fetal exposure to maternal cortisol through the 11-Beta Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase isoenzyme type 2 (11-β HSD2) enzyme. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of prenatal psychological distress (PPD) on placental 11-β HSD2 gene expression and explore the related mechanistic pathways involved in fetal neurodevelopment. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, APA PsycInfo®, and ProQuest Dissertations for observational studies assessing the association between PPD and 11-β HSD2 expression in human placentas. Adjusted regression coefficients (β) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled based on three contextual PPD exposure groups: prenatal depression, anxiety symptoms, and perceived stress. Results: Of 3159 retrieved records, sixteen longitudinal studies involving 1869 participants across seven countries were included. Overall, exposure to PPD disorders showed weak negative associations with the placental 11-β HSD2 gene expression as follows: prenatal depression (β −0.01, 95% CI 0.05–0.02, I2=0%), anxiety symptoms (β −0.02, 95% CI 0.06–0.01, I2=0%), and perceived stress (β −0.01 95% CI 0.06–0.04, I2=62.8%). Third-trimester PPD exposure was more frequently associated with lower placental 11-β HSD2 levels. PPD and placental 11-β HSD2 were associated with changes in cortisol reactivity and the development of adverse health outcomes in mothers and children. Female-offspring were more vulnerable to PPD exposures. Conclusion: The study presents evidence of a modest role of prenatal psychological distress in regulating placental 11-β HSD2 gene expression. Future prospective cohorts utilizing larger sample sizes or advanced statistical methods to enhance the detection of small effect sizes should be planned. Additionally, controlling for key predictors such as the mother’s ethnicity, trimester of PPD exposure, mode of delivery, and infant sex is crucial for valid exploration of PPD effects on fetal programming.

        <ab>Background: Studies have identified adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes for women with psychiatric disorders. Additionally, psychiatric disorders may pose an increased risk for unintended pregnancies (UPs) which in turn may also impact negatively on outcomes. The present study aims to compare the incidence of UPs in women with versus without current/past psychiatric diagnoses and investigates whether psychiatric history modifies the relation between delivery outcomes in women with and without UPs. Methods: A retrospective cohort was compiled of women who gave birth in a large hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Women ≥18 years old with singleton pregnancies and birth registrations in the electronic patient file during January 1, 2015 to March 1, 2020 were included. Patient characteristics (including pregnancy intention and psychiatric history), maternal (gestational diabetes, mode of delivery) and neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age [GA], birthweight and Apgar scores) were registered by health care providers in hospital charts. Incidence of UPs was compared between women with versus without current/past psychiatric diagnoses. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between women with versus without UPs with linear or logistic regression models adjusted for relevant confounders with an interaction term for UP with current/past psychiatric diagnoses. Results: We included 1219 women with and 1093 women without current/ past psychiatric diagnoses. Current/past psychiatric diagnoses were significantly associated with UPs after adjustment for confounders (39.0% vs. 29.6%, OR 1.56, CI 1.23–2.00, p &lt; 0.001). In sub-analyses, women with depressive (OR 1.67, CI 1.24–2.26, p = 0.001), personality (OR 2.64, CI 1.38–5.11, p = 0.004) and substance-related and addictive disorders (OR 4.29, CI 1.90– 10.03, p = 0.001) had higher odds of UPs compared to women without current/past psychiatric diagnoses. Amongst women with UPs, current/past psychiatric diagnoses did not modify maternal or neonatal outcomes, except for GA at delivery as women with both UPs and current/past psychiatric diagnosis had a 2.21-day higher mean GA at delivery than women in the reference group (p-value interaction = 0.001). Conclusions: Current/past psychiatric diagnoses are associated with a higher odd of UPs. In our sample, maternal and neonatal outcomes were comparable for women with and without UPs and these results were similar for women with and without current/past psychiatric diagnoses, except for GA at delivery. Although our study is limited by several factors, we found that women with current/past psychiatric diagnoses, irrespective of pregnancy planning status, do not have more adverse maternal or pregnancy outcomes. Increased efforts are needed to ensure that psychoeducation and conversations about pregnancy planning and UPs are available for women with current/past psychiatric diagnoses.

        <ab>Introduction: Different systematic reviews have been developed in the last decades about maternal risks of immediate pushing and delayed pushing, depending on the duration of the second stage of labour, but they do not provide conclusive evidence. Aim: The main aim of this overview of systematic reviews was to assess the maternal outcomes using delayed pushing and immediate pushing in the second stage of labour in women receiving epidural analgesia. Methods: We searched systematically in PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, CINAHL, and Scopus (October 26th, 2023). Methodological quality was analysed using AMSTAR and ROBIS scales, and the strength of evidence was established according to the guidelines advisory committee grading criteria. The outcome measures were the duration of the second stage of labour, duration of active pushing, caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth, spontaneous vaginal birth, fatigue score, perineal lacerations, postpartum haemorrhage, and rate of episiotomy. Seven systematic reviews with and without meta-analysis were included. Results: Results showed that delayed pushing increases the total time of the second stage of labour, although delayed pushing decreases the duration of active pushing with moderate quality of evidence. Mixed results were found with respect to the variables instrumental vaginal birth, spontaneous vaginal birth, and fatigue score although the results favour delayed pushing or show no statistically significant differences with respect to immediate pushing. No favourable results were ever found for immediate pushing with respect to delayed pushing, with a limited quality of evidence. Even so, delayed pushing seems to be associated with a significant increase in spontaneous vaginal birth rates. The results found no significant differences between the immediate pushing and delayed pushing groups in the caesarean section rates, perineal lacerations, postpartum haemorrhage, and episiotomy ratio, with a limited quality of evidence. Conclusions: This study shows that delayed pushing during the second stage of labour produces at least the same maternal outcomes as immediate pushing, although we note that delayed pushing produces an increase of the duration of the second stage of labour, a shorter duration of the active pushing and a tendency to increase spontaneous vaginal birth and to reduce the instrumental vaginal birth rates and fatigue scores. This should be considered clinically. This review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO (CRD42023397616).

        <ab>ObjectiveTo identify characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of patient-initiated encounters with a health care professional before the scheduled 6-week postpartum visit.MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study of postpartum persons who received prenatal care and delivered at a single academic level IV maternity care center in 2019. We determined associations between maternal sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics and the likelihood of patient-initiated early postpartum encounters with χ2 tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous and ordinal variables.ResultsA total of 796 patients were included in our analysis, and 324 (40.7%) initiated an early postpartum encounter. Significantly more postpartum persons who initiated early postpartum encounters were primiparous persons (54.3%) than multiparous (33.8%) persons (P &lt; .001). Postpartum persons who desired breastfeeding or who had prolonged maternal hospitalization, episiotomy, or cesarean or operative vaginal delivery were also significantly more likely to initiate early postpartum encounters (all P≤.002). Of postpartum persons who initiated early encounters, 44 (13.6%) initiated in-person visits, 138 (42.6%) initiated telephone or patient portal communication, and 142 (43.8%) initiated encounters of both types. Specifically, 39.2% of postpartum persons initiated at least one early postpartum encounter for lactation support, and nearly half of early postpartum encounters occurred during the first week after hospital discharge.ConclusionEarly postpartum encounters were more common among primiparas and postpartum persons who were breastfeeding or had prolonged hospitalization, episiotomy, cesarean delivery, or operative vaginal delivery. Future studies should focus on the development of evidence-based guidelines for recommending early postpartum visits. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The City Birth Trauma Scale (City BiTS) assesses posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms following childbirth (PTSD-FC). Recent studies investigating the latent factor structure of PTSD-FC in women reported mixed results. No validated French questionnaire exists to measure PTSD-FC symptoms. Therefore, this study first aimed to validate the French version of the City BiTS (City BiTS-F). Second, it aimed to establish the latent factor structure of PTSD-FC. Method: French-speaking women with infants aged 1 to 12 months old (n = 541) completed an online cross-sectional survey. Questionnaires included the City BiTS-F, the PTSD Checklist, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Additionally, sociodemographic and medical data were collected. Results: The two-factor model with birth-related symptoms (BRS) and general symptoms (GS) fit the data well, whereas the four-factor model was not confirmed. The bifactor model with a general factor and the BRS and GS gave the best fit to the data, suggesting that use of the total score in addition to the BRS and GS subscales scores is justified. High reliability (α = .88 to .90) and good convergent and divergent validity were obtained. Discriminant validity was calculated with weeks of gestation, gravidity, history of traumatic childbirth and event, and mode of delivery. Discussion: The City BiTS-F is a reliable and valid measure of PTSD-FC symptoms in French-speaking women. Both total score and BRS or GS subscale scores can be calculated. This psychometric tool is of importance for clinical and research purposes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>
        <ab>The City Birth Trauma Scale (City BiTS) is a measure of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms following childbirth (PTSD-FC) based on the DSM–5 PTSD criteria (Ayers et al., 2018). The current study established its psychometric properties within a French-speaking postpartum population. Our results suggested that PTSD-FC consists of two components, birth-related symptoms (e.g., distressing birth-related flashbacks) and general symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, aggressiveness). Mothers with a history of traumatic childbirth, a history of traumatic event, or an emergency caesarean section showed higher PTSD-FC symptoms. The use of this validated psychometric tool is highly recommended within French-speaking postpartum mothers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Fear of childbirth (FOC) has adverse effect on delivery, maternal and infant health. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of FOC and to examine the role of perfectionism, intolerance of uncertainty, and preparedness for childbirth in explaining FOC in non-pregnant and pregnant women, as well as the role of mode of delivery in multiparous women. Method: In the cross-sectional study, 197 non-pregnant, 168 nulliparous and 124 multiparous pregnant women filled out questionnaires on FOC (W-DEQ), perfectionism (PNPS), intolerance of uncertainty (IUS), and a question on preparedness for childbirth. Results: More important determinants of FOC were personality traits (perfectionism and intolerance of uncertainty) in non-pregnant and nulliparous pregnant women, as opposed to previous childbirth experience (emergency caesarean section) in multiparous women. However, preparedness for childbirth was associated with FOC in all three sub-groups. Conclusion: Preparedness for childbirth should be the target in prenatal classes in order to alleviate FOC.

        <ab>Antecedentes: El miedo al parto (MP) influye de un modo adverso en el mismo y en la salud materna e infantil. El estudio tiene por objeto analizar la prevalencia del MP y el papel del perfeccionismo, la intolerancia a la incertidumbre y la preparación para el parto para explicar el MP en mujeres embarazadas y no embarazadas así como el papel que juega el modo de alumbramiento en mujeres multíparas. Método: En el estudio transversal 197 mujeres no encintas, 168 embarazadas nulíparas y 124 multíparas cumplimentaron cuestionarios sobre MP (W-DEQ), perfeccionismo (PNPS), intolerancia a la incertidumbre (IUS) y una pregunta sobre preparación para el parto. Resultados: Los determinantes más importantes del MP fueron los rasgos de personalidad (perfeccionismo e intolerancia a la incertidumbre) en mujeres no encintas y en embarazadas nulíparas en oposición a la experiencia previa de parto (cesárea de emergencia) en mujeres multíparas. No obstante, la preparación para el parto se asociaba al MP en los tres subgrupos. Conclusión: La preparación para el parto debería abordarse en las clases prenatales para aliviar el MP.

        <ab>ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the association between insurance type and permanent contraception fulfillment among those with cesarean deliveries. Additionally, we sought to examine modification by the scheduled status of the cesarean.Study DesignWe used data from a multi-site cohort study of patients who delivered in 2018–2019 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Illinois, MetroHealth Medical System in Ohio, or University of Alabama at Birmingham in Alabama. All patients had permanent contraception as their contraceptive plan in their medical chart during delivery hospitalization. We used logistic regression to model the association between insurance type, scheduled status of cesarean and permanent contraception fulfillment by hospital discharge. The scheduled status of cesarean delivery was examined as an effect modifier.ResultsCompared to patients with private insurance, those with Medicaid were less likely to have their desired permanent contraception procedure fulfilled by hospital discharge (89.3% vs. 96.8%, p &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for covariates, patients with Medicaid had a lower odds of permanent contraception fulfillment by hospital discharge (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.77). This association was stronger among those who had unscheduled cesarean deliveries (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.74) than those with scheduled cesarean deliveries (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.88).Conclusions for PracticeCompared to patients with private insurance undergoing a cesarean delivery, those with Medicaid insurance were less likely to have their desired permanent contraception fulfilled. Physicians and hospitals must examine their practices surrounding Medicaid forms to ensure that patients have valid consent forms available at the time of delivery.

        <ab>Introduction: Telehealth is an applicable, acceptable, cost-effective, easily accessible, and speedy method for pregnant women. This study aimed to examine the impact of telehealth applications on pregnancy outcomes and costs in highrisk pregnancies. Methods: Studies were selected from PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus, and Clinical Key databases according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria from January to February 2021. Cochrane risk-of-bias tools were used in the quality assessment of the studies. Results: Four observational and eight randomized controlled studies were included in this meta-analysis (telehealth: 135,875, control: 94,275). It was seen that the number of ultrasound (p &lt; 0.01) and face-to-face visits (p &lt; 0.01), fasting insulin (p &lt; 0.01), hemoglobin A1C before delivery (p &lt; 0.01), and emergency cesarean section rates (p = 0.05) were lower in the telehealth group. In the telehealth group, the women’s use of antenatal corticosteroids (p = 0.03) and hypoglycemic medication at delivery (p = 0.03), the total of nursing interventions (p &lt; 0.01), compliance with actual blood glucose measurements (p &lt; 0.01), induction intervention at delivery (p = 0.003), and maternal mortality (p &lt; 0.001) rates were higher. Two groups were similar in terms of the use of medical therapy, total gestational weight gain, health problems related to pregnancy, mode and complications of delivery, maternal intensive care unit admission, fetal-neonatal growth and development, neonatal health problems and mortality, follow-up, and care costs. Discussion: Telehealth and routine care yielded similar maternal/neonatal health and cost outcomes. It can be said that telehealth is a safe technique to work with in the management of high-risk pregnancies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people are at higher risk than their non-DHH counterparts of experiencing adverse birth outcomes. There is a lack of research focusing on social, linguistic, and medical factors related to being DHH which may identify groups of DHH people who experience more inequity. OBJECTIVE: Examine difference in prevalence of cesarean and adverse birth outcomes among diverse sub-groups of DHH people. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of DHH birthing people in the U.S. who gave birth within the past 10 years. The sample was predominantly white, college educated, and married. We assessed cesarean birth and three adverse birth outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, and NICU admission post-delivery. DHH-specific variables were genetic etiology of hearing loss, preferred language (i.e., American Sign Language, English, or bilingual), severity of hearing loss, age of onset of hearing loss, and self-reported quality of perinatal care communication. We estimated prevalence, 95 % confidence intervals, and unadjusted prevalence ratios. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of our sample reported a cesarean birth. Overall, there were no significant differences in prevalence across the outcome variables with respect to preferred language, genetic etiology, severity, and age of onset. Poorer perinatal care communication quality was associated with higher prevalence of preterm birth (PR = 2.37) and NICU admission (PR = 1.91). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found no evidence supporting differences in obstetric outcomes among DHH birthing people across medical factors related to deafness. Findings support the important role of communication access for DHH people in healthcare environments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Mode of birth has been linked to offspring health. Changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) may represent a potential mechanism; however, findings are heterogeneous and limited to early infancy. This preregistered study examined whether mode of birth (vaginal birth compared with elective or emergency cesarean section) affects DNAm at birth, in childhood, and adolescence and whether these effects are modified by the postnatal care environment, specifically by breastfeeding and mother–infant bonding. Using data from 876 mother–infant dyads from the U.K. Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we examined differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides and regions associated with mode of birth. DNAm was quantified using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip in cord blood (at birth) and in peripheral blood (at 7 and 15–17 years). Analyses controlled for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, child sex, gestational week at birth, and batch effects. We also examined interactions of mode of birth with breastfeeding practices and mother–infant bonding. In cord blood, two cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (cg05230316; cg13230077) were linked to mode of birth (pFDR &lt; .050). DNAm in childhood or adolescence was not statistically associated with mode of birth (pFDR &gt; .050), and breastfeeding and mother–infant bonding were not moderators (p &gt; .050). Overall, findings suggest mode of birth may have a small effect on cord blood DNAm, but these effects may not persist into later developmental stages. Other postnatal influences should be considered, and further investigation is needed to address study limitations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>
        <ab>This study suggests that the mode of birth, whether a child is born vaginally or by emergency or elective cesarean section, has a small effect on how the child’s genes are methylated in cord blood cells at birth. DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells during childhood and adolescence was not predicted by mode of birth. Breastfeeding and mother–infant bonding did not buffer the effects of mode of birth, highlighting the necessity to further investigate other postnatal factors as potential determinants of the offspring methylome across development.

        <ab>The most common reason for mothers’ request for a cesarean section is fear of childbirth. The present study was conducted to determine the relationship between spiritual health and anxiety and fear of childbirth in pregnant women. This correlational cross-sectional study was performed on 426 pregnant women who were referred to Yahyanejad Hospital in Babol, Iran, during 2018–2021. These pregnant women were hospitalized in the maternity ward for vaginal delivery. Convenience sampling bases on inclusion criteria were done to select the subjects. The questionnaires used in this study included Demographic and Obstetric Questionnaire, Anxiety and Fear of Childbirth Questionnaire by Pirdel et al., and Palutzian &amp; Ellison Spiritual Well-being Scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 using descriptive and analytical indicators and linear and multiple correlation tests. The results of the study showed that all pregnant women experienced moderate (23.1) or severe (76.9) fear and anxiety, and none of the women had low fear and anxiety. Moreover, all women in this study had moderate (50.5) or high (49.5) spiritual health. The results of linear regression test showed that there is a significant and inverse relationship between spiritual health and anxiety and fear of childbirth (R: − 0.12, CI − 0.14, − 0.019, P = 0.011). Furthermore, the results of multivariate linear regression test after adjustments for intervening demographic and midwifery variables showed a significant relationship between spiritual health (R: − 0.12, CI − 0.14, − 0.02, P = 0.009), education level and number of pregnancies, and anxiety and fear of childbirth. The results of the study showed that with the increase in spiritual health, anxiety and fear of childbirth decreases. Therefore, it can be inferred that women need spiritual care in addition to medical care to deal with fear and anxiety during pregnancy and childbirth.

        <ab>Purpose: We investigated sexual orientation disparities in several obstetric and perinatal outcomes in Louisiana and examined whether these disparities differed among Black, Latine, and White populations. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional vital records data on singleton live births in Louisiana (2016–2022). Same-sex relationships (SSR) vs. different-sex relationships (DSR) were classified based on the sex of the parents listed on the birth certificate. Using modified Poisson regression, we estimated adjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals among birthing persons in SSR vs. DSR for preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), spontaneous labor, Cesarean delivery, gestational hypertension, and gestational diabetes. We examined within and across group disparities in models stratified by sexual orientation and race/ethnicity. Results: In the total birthing population, those in SSR experienced higher risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes and were less likely to have spontaneous labor compared with persons in DSR. The risk of PTB and LBW was two-fold higher among Black birthing people in SSR compared with White birthing people in SSR and DSR. Latine birthing people in SSR experienced higher risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes compared with their peers in DSR and White people in DSR. Some of these disparities were partially explained by including socioeconomic and health risk factors. Conclusion: Sexual orientation–related disparities exist across and within racial/ethnic groups among birthing people in Louisiana. Adopting an intersectional approach that considers the mutually constituted nature of heterosexism and racism is critical to addressing sexual orientation–related inequities in reproductive and perinatal health.

        <ab>Background: Satisfaction with the birth experience has been established to be critical for the wellbeing of the mother. The Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised (BSS-R) is a brief and psychometrically robust multi-dimensional self-report tool designed to assess birth experience. The current investigation sought to translate and validate a Czech Republic version of the BSS-R (CZ-BSS-R). Methods: Following translation psychometric assessment of the CZ-BSS-R was undertaken using a cross-sectional design. A between-subjects design was incorporated in order to evaluate known-groups validity evaluation of the translated measure. Four hundred and sixty-five Czech-speaking women within the Czech Republic took part in the study. Confirmatory factor analysis was undertaken and divergent and convergent validity and internal consistency characteristics also evaluated. Results: The CZ-BSS-R was observed to have excellent psychometric properties and conceptually and measurement faithful to the original English-language measure. Consistent with previous investigations using the BSS-R significant differences were found in scores as a function of delivery type. Conclusions: The CZ-BSS-R is a valid, robust and reliable measure of birth experience and suitable for use with Czech-speaking women in the Czech Republic. The study highlighted that instrument and emergency Caesarean section were associated with a lower level of birth satisfaction compared to vaginal delivery.

        <ab>Although many women report sexual dysfunction in the postpartum period, controversial research has been reported the relationship between delivery mode and sexual function. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the sexual function after childbirth and identify the difference of sexual function based on the female sexual function index (FSFI) questionnaire in women with elective cesarean section, vaginal delivery with episiotomy and vaginal delivery without episiotomy. Studies were found by searching in Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and considering the references of the related papers from their start dates until September 2021. All observational studies in English that reported the mean and SD of score of sexual function and its domains based on the mode of delivery were included in this meta-analysis. Random effect model was used to combine the results of included studies on female sexual function and its subdomains. Finally, 17 articles with a total population of 3410 were included in the meta-analysis. Total mean (95 percent CI) of sexual function was 24.27 (22.82, 25.72) with substantial heterogeneity among studies (χ² = 7487.63, P &lt; .001; I² = 99.45). In subgroup analyses, the mean score of sexual function was significantly differed in terms of time elapsed since delivery (P = .04) and studied country (P &lt; .001). But, the mode of delivery has no significant effect on postpartum sexual function and subdomains. The result indicated that elective cesarean section, vaginal delivery with episiotomy, vaginal delivery without episiotomy are not associated with the female sexual function.

        <ab>Objective To assess the preferences of women undergoing cesarean delivery regarding intraoperative conversations among healthcare personnel. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted by distribution of an open anonymous questionnaire on social media platforms during March 2022, targeting respondents with a history of cesarean delivery. The primary outcome was patients’ experience of 'being disturbed by professional and casual conversations of the personnel', rated on a 1–5 Likert scale. Results 1203 participants completed the questionnaire, with 97.6% reporting intraoperative conversations among personnel. Casual conversations were perceived as 'disturbing' by more respondents vs. professional talk (33.4% vs. 27.6%, respectively, p = 0.0077). Logistic regression analysis revealed associations between feeling disturbed and higher intraoperative stress and pain – adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–4.5, and OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.8–4.0, respectively, for professional conversations; OR 3.0, 95%CI 2.0–4.4, and OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.1–2.7, respectively, for casual conversations. Feeling disturbed by professional conversations was also associated with urgent vs. elective operations (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.4-3.0). Direct personnel-patient communication was associated with significantly lower stress levels (60.8% vs. 72.5% in the remaining cohort, p &lt; 0.001). Discussion Intraoperative conversations of the personnel occur during vast majority of cesarean deliveries. Given that a substantial proportion of patients find these conversations disturbing, it is advisable to conduct a preliminary assessment of maternal preferences. This proactive step can help tailor communication strategies to individual patient comfort and preferences, ultimately enhancing the birthing experience and maternal well-being.

        <ab>Introduction: Little is known of the associations between physical health issues and mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) occurring in the perinatal period. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study with 3009 first-time mothers giving birth in Ireland collected physical and mental health data in pregnancy and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum. Mental health was measured using the depression and anxiety subscales of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Experience of eight common physical health issues (e.g. severe headaches/migraines, back pain) were assessed in pregnancy, with an additional six assessed at each postpartum data collection point. Results: 2.4 % of women reported depression alone in pregnancy and 4 % reported depression across the first postpartum year. Anxiety alone was reported by 3.0 % of women in pregnancy, and 2 % in the first year postpartum. Prevalence of comorbid anxiety/depression (CAD) was 1.5 % in pregnancy and almost 2 % postpartum. A higher proportion of women reporting, compared to women not reporting, postpartum CAD were younger, not partnered, not in paid employment in pregnancy, have fewer years of education, and had a caesarean birth. Extreme tiredness/exhaustion and back pain were the most common physical health issues in pregnancy and postpartum. Constipation, haemorrhoids, bowel issues, breast issues, infection and pain in the perineum or caesarean wound, pelvic pain and urinary tract infections were highest at three months postpartum and gradually decreased thereafter. Women reporting depression alone or anxiety alone were equivalent in terms of physical health issues. However, women without mental health symptoms reported significantly fewer physical health issues than women reporting depressive or anxiety symptoms alone or CAD at every time point. Women with CAD reported a significantly higher number of health issues than women reporting depression alone or anxiety alone at 9 and 12 months postpartum. Conclusion: Reports of mental health symptoms are associated with higher physical health burden demonstrating a need for integrated approaches in mental and physical health care pathways in perinatal services.

        <ab>Background: Ketamine and esketamine has been suggested to have potential efficacy in preventing postpartum depression (PPD) recent years. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of ketamine and esketamine on PPD after cesarean delivery. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies investigating the efficacy of ketamine and esketamine in preventing PPD. The primary outcomes of this study were risk ratios (RRs) and EPDS scores (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) in relation to PPD after ketamine and esketamine. The second outcomes were the postoperative adverse events. Results: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective study including 2916 patients were analyzed, including six on the use of ketamine and eight on the use of esketamine. The risk ratios and EPDS scores of PPD were significantly decreased in the ketamine/esketamine group compared to those in the control group in one week and four weeks postoperative periods. Subgroup analyses showed that high dosage, administrated in patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) method and only esketamine exhibited a significant reduction in the incidence and EPDS scores of PPD in one week and four week postoperative. However, the incidences of postoperative adverse events, such as dizziness, diplopia, hallucination, and headache were significantly higher in the ketamine/esketamine group than that in the control group. Conclusion: Ketamine and esketamine appear to be effective in preventing PPD in the one week and four week postoperative periods after cesarean delivery with moderate certainty of evidence. But they can also lead to some short-term complications too. Future high-quality studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of ketamine and esketamine in different countries.

        <ab>Child behavioural and mental health problems have become a public health crisis. The consequences of poor mental health in childhood have large economic costs and consequences for the individual, their families, and for society. Early intervention through parenting programmes can reduce the onset of poor mental health in childhood, hence evaluating the effectiveness of parenting programmes is critical. The ‘Incredible Years Toddler’ parent programme is an education and training intervention designed to enhance the social and emotional wellbeing of children aged 1–3 years. Whilst previous studies show Incredible Years Toddler to provide promising effects on child outcomes in the short term, the research samples have lacked ethnic diversity and representation from socioeconomically deprived families. This quasi-experimental study is registered on ISRCTN (ISRCTN49991769). We will investigate the effectiveness of Incredible Years Toddler being delivered in three neighbourhoods in inner city Bradford, England. These neighbourhoods contain a socially and ethnically diverse population with 84% living in the poorest decile for England and Wales. Parents with a child aged 1–3 years old who are enrolled in Born in Bradford’s Better Start interventional family cohort study are eligible for this study. Intervention participants will be matched to a demographically comparable control group using propensity score matching. This study will use retrospective and prospective data from participants who attended Incredible Years groups between September 2018 and April 2024. The required minimum sample is n = 1336 (ratio 1:3) to detect a small effect (odds = 1.5, d = .20) on the Early Years Foundation Stage profile total score at age 5; a measure of early child development that is routinely collected by teachers. We will also establish whether these effects are moderated by child age at entry to intervention, programme delivery mode, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. We will also estimate the cost of the intervention and conduct a cost-consequence analysis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>PurposeExisting evidence on the relationship between mode of delivery and offspring emotional and behavioural problems, especially in older age groups, is limited and inconsistent. This study aimed to examine the association between obstetric mode of delivery and emotional and behavioural problems in offspring aged 3–16 years.MethodsThe sample for this study comprised participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in the United Kingdom. The study cohort ranged from 7074 (at 3 years of age) to 4071 (at 16 years of age) mother–offspring pairs. Data on obstetric mode of delivery were abstracted from obstetric records by trained research midwives and classified as spontaneous vaginal delivery, assisted vaginal delivery and caesarean delivery (elective and emergency). Offspring emotional and behavioural problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when the child was 3, 7, 9, 11, and 16 years. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations.ResultsAssisted vaginal delivery was associated with an increased risk of emotional problems at age 11 years (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.11–1.81). No significant associations were observed at ages 3, 7, 9 and 16. We found no evidence of associations between caesarean delivery (elective or emergency) and emotional and behavioural measures in offspring across all age groups.ConclusionMode of delivery does not appear to be associated with emotional and behavioural problems in children and adolescents. Further research is needed to understand the potential longer-term effects of assisted vaginal deliveries on offspring emotional development.

        <ab>Background: Shared decision-making between clinicians and pregnant women with prior cesarean on the subsequent mode of delivery improves trial of labor rates, and reduces the number of repeat cesarean sections and their related complications. However, this practice is insufficient worldwide and the factors influencing it are still unknown. The study aimed at determining the proportion of pregnant women involved in shared decision-making and its associated factors in Dar es Salaam. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study among 350 pregnant women with one prior cesarean section. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire and SPSS 23 was used for analysis. A score of 80 or higher on the nine-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDMQ9) was used to calculate the proportion of women, and the associated factors were obtained using a logistic regression model. P value of &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The proportion of pregnant women involved in shared decision making was 38%. Factors that were significantly associated with sharing decision making were; having low level of education (AOR 0.55 95% CI 0.33–0.91), being married/having partner (AOR 2.58 95% CI 1.43–4.63), having a companion who had active participation (AOR 3.31 95% CI 1.03–10.6) and being familiar with the clinician (AOR 5.01 95% CI 1.30–19.2). Conclusion: To promote practice of shared decision making in our setting, encouragement of socially vulnerable pregnant women’s participation in decision-making by health care professionals, encouragement of companion participation during antenatal care and promotion of personal continuity of care to improve familiarity to clinicians are needed.

        <ab>BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted pregnant and breastfeeding women. Both low- and high-risk groups adopted preventive approaches such as mask-wearing and handwashing to slow down and prevent viral transmission during critical periods that may affect mother-child interactions.MethodsA longitudinal observational study was conducted with primiparous women recruited using convenience sampling from the postpartum care ward of Afzalipour Teaching Hospital in Kerman from August 1, 2020 to March 30, 2021. The research questionnaires included demographic information, preventive behaviors, breastfeeding intention and practices, postpartum distress, and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. All the questionnaires were self-reported online in three stages: before discharge from the postpartum ward, the first month after delivery, and the third month after delivery.ResultsA Total of 160 primiparous women were included. The results showed significant changes in preventive behaviors and postpartum distress levels during the study. Breastfeeding intention and practices were negatively affected by postpartum distress (P = 0.034), unwanted pregnancies (P = 0.009), and cesarean delivery (P &lt; 0.001). Postpartum distress was directly affected by the presence of depression (P &lt; 0.001). Preventive behaviors at discharge were significantly associated with postpartum distress three months after delivery (P = 0.013). The study also found an association between women’s and partner’s education, unwanted pregnancy, and cesarean delivery that determined postpartum distress.ConclusionsPandemic restrictions did not affect breastfeeding intentions or practices, possibly due to sufficient social and family support during the pandemic. However, robust guidelines are required to increase enable women’s access to specializede care to cope with future pandemics, particularly during the first few weeks after childbirth.

        <ab>Objectives: To investigate associations of neonatal characteristics and pregnancy complications with bipolar disorder (BPD) in offspring. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study among 2,059,578 non-malformed singleton live-births in Sweden born 1983–2004. Using national registries with prospectively recorded information, we followed participants for a BPD diagnosis from 13 up to 34 years of age. We compared BPD risks between exposure categories using hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from adjusted Cox models. We also conducted sibling-controlled analyses among 1,467,819 full siblings. Results: There were 14,998 BPD diagnoses. Risk of BPD was 0.74% through 25 years of age. Very/extremely preterm birth (22 to 31 weeks) was related to increased BPD HRs in sibling-controlled analyses; compared with a gestational age of 37 weeks, adjusted HR (95% CI) for 31, 28, and 22 weeks were, respectively, 1.31 (0.99, 1.74), 2.09 (1.15, 3.79), and 5.74 (1.15, 28.63). Spontaneous but not medically indicated very/ extremely preterm birth was associated with increased risk. Compared with vaginal birth, caesarean section birth was associated with 1.20 (1.08, 1.33) and 1.58 (1.06, 2.36) times higher BPD risk in general and sibling cohorts, respectively. Small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth was related to increased BPD HRs in general cohort and sibling analyses (HRs [95% CI] were 1.22 [1.06, 1.39] and 1.68 [1.13, 2.50], respectively); only term SGA was associated with increased risk. Head circumference-for-gestational age, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and placental abruption were not associated with BPD. Conclusions: Very/extremely preterm birth, caesarean birth, and SGA are related to BPD incidence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The aetiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is heterogeneous and is attributed to the concurrent interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors. The steady increase in ASD rates in recent years makes the detection and study of environmental risk factors increasingly important. This systematic review identifies potential environmental factors associated with ASD focusing specifically on recent studies conducted in selected Southern European countries. Nine relevant studies were selected for this systematic review. Results indicate that ASD in Southern Europe is associated with a variety of prenatal, perinatal and postnatal environmental factors, including stressful early life events, maternal infection during pregnancy, delivery mode and perinatal complications or breastfeeding problems in the offspring. Specially designed, large population-based birth cohort studies are needed in Southern Europe, to allow precise assessment of potential environmental confounders and elucidate their association with ASD.

        <ab>Objective To determine the association between periodontal disease and low birth weight among pregnant women. Methods Data for this case-control study was collected from June 2019 till February 2020. All women in the Gynecology Department of Lady Willingdon Hospital, Lahore, who had delivered a baby within the last 24 h were invited to participate. Women who delivered babies less than 2.5 kg were considered as ‘cases’ (having low birth weight – LBW – infants) and those having babies of 2.5 kg or more were categorized as ‘controls’ (normal birth weight infants). The selected sample was matched for age, general health (indicated by mean upper arm circumference) and Hemoglobin levels. Intraoral examination was conducted and gingival color and appearance; calculus, bleeding on probing, CPITN (Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs) and CAL (clinical attachment loss) were recorded. A binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of LBW infants. The predictors were further confirmed by applying chi-squared test for categorical variables and independent sample T test for quantitative variables. Results A total of 60 cases and 120 controls were recruited. The logistic regression model suggested that CPITN score (OR 14.893, 95% CI 4.896, 45.301); CAL (OR 2.148, 95% CI 1.271, 3.631); calculus (OR 25.099, 95% CI 1.916, 328.771); mode of delivery (OR 0.175 95% CI 0.060, 0.514); and gingival recession (OR 0.237, 95% CI 0.078, 0.715) were significant predictors of LBW. Conclusion Periodontal disease was found to be a significant predictor of LBW infants. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Accumulating evidence suggests a long-term health risk of cesarean section for the mother and child, but few studies have examined the link between cesarean section and parenting stress. Here, we examined this association by exploiting a large dataset. Methods: Participants were 65,235 mothers participating in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study, an ongoing nationwide birth cohort. Outcome variables were parenting stress assessed as total score and subscale scores (representing the difficult child, parental distress, and spouse factors) on the Japanese 19-item version of the Parenting Stress Index Short Form (J-PSI-SF). Exposures were the mode of delivery, the timing of the J-PSI-SF assessment (1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 years postpartum), and the interaction between them. Multivariate regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted β coefficients and standard error of the means (SEMs). Results: The J-PSI-SF total score was higher in the cesarean section group than in the vaginal delivery group (adjusted β = 0.24, SEM = 0.09). This increase was primarily due to higher scores for the difficult child factor (adjusted β = 0.18, SEM = 0.05) and not to higher scores for the parental distress or spouse factor. Conclusions: Cesarean section was associated with higher parenting stress, especially in relation to the difficult child factor. Our results highlight the importance of paying particular attention to the mental health of both mother and child in the case of cesarean section.

        <ab>Objective: We compared pain and the ease of insertion of two different types of intrauterine devices (IUDs; the levonorgestrel intrauterine systems 52 mg (LNG-IUS 52 mg) and the copper-bearing IUD [TCu380A]) among nulligravidas and parous women with and without caesarean delivery. Methods: A cross-sectional study assessed pain referred by women and ease of insertion of the two IUDs models. We applied a visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess pain, while the ease of insertion was defined by healthcare professionals. Results: We assessed 1076 women, including 334 nulligravidas and 566 parous women who had had at least one caesarean delivery and 176 women with history of only vaginal delivery. Regarding pain at IUD placement, 26 (2.5%) women reported no pain, 167 (16.4%) light pain, 319 (31.3%) moderate and 506 (49.7%) intense pain. The highest scores for pain were reported by nulligravidas (67.2%, p = 0.001), while the mean pain score was higher in the LNG-IUS 52 mg group. Difficulties reported by healthcare providers were more frequent in the nulligravidas (21.2%) and women with previous caesarean delivery (16.9%). Conclusions: Our findings suggested differences between the two IUDs tested, with higher pain associated with the LNG-IUS 52 mg, and highlights the need for pain management, mainly among nulligravida and women with history of caesarean delivery.

        <ab>SHORT CONDENSATION Intense pain at insertion was more related to nulligravida than parous women and more pain with placement of LNG-IUS 52 mg IUDs than TCu380A IUDs. Nevertheless, our results confirmed that ease of IUD placement was between 80% to 90% of all insertions, being more common in parous women without previous caesarean delivery.

        <ab>Background: Limited efforts have been paid to explore the underlying genetic mechanisms of birth by caesarian section (CS) affecting the risks of adult anxiety and self-harm. Methods: Using UK Biobank cohort, the logistic regression model was first applied to evaluate the associations of adult anxiety and self-harm with birth by CS. Using birth by CS as exposure variables, genome-wide by environment interaction study (GWEIS) was then applied by PLINK2.0 to identify associated genes interacting with birth by CS for anxiety and self-harm. Results: In the observational study, significant associations were observed between birth by CS and anxiety (odds ratio (OR) = 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12–1.38; P = 4.86 × 10−5), and self-harm (OR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01–1.24; P = 2.90 × 10−2). GWEIS revealed multiple suggestive genes interacted with birth by CS for anxiety, such as DKK2 (rs13137764, P = 1.24 × 10−9, adjusted P = 2.68 × 10−7) and ATXN1 (rs62389045, P = 4.38 × 10−8, adjusted P = 3.55 × 10−6). For self-harm, significant gene-environment interactions of birth by CS on self-harm were detected, such as ALDH1A2 (rs77828167, P = 1.62 × 10−8; rs116899929, P = 1.92 × 10−8) and DAB1 (rs116124269, P = 3.20 × 10−8; rs191070006, P = 3.63 × 10−8). Conclusions: Our results suggested that birth by CS was associated with the risk of adult anxiety and self-harm. We also discovered some genes interacted with birth by CS might influence the risk of anxiety and self-harm, which may provide novel clues for the pathogenesis of those mental disorders.

        <ab>Pregnancy is a unique neuroplastic period in adult life. This longitudinal study tracked brain cortical changes during the peripartum period and explored how the type of childbirth affects these changes. We collected neuroanatomic, obstetric and neuropsychological data from 110 first-time mothers during late pregnancy and early postpartum, as well as from 34 nulliparous women evaluated at similar time points. During late pregnancy, mothers showed lower cortical volume than controls across all functional networks. These cortical differences attenuated in the early postpartum session. Default mode and frontoparietal networks showed below-expected volume increases during peripartum, suggesting that their reductions may persist longer. Results also pointed to different cortical trajectories in mothers who delivered by scheduled C-section. The main findings were replicated in an independent sample of 29 mothers and 24 nulliparous women. These data suggest a dynamic trajectory of cortical decreases during pregnancy that attenuates in the postpartum period, at a different rate depending on the brain network and childbirth type.

        <ab>Background: Children who experience mental health issues, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), experience significant distress and impairment at home, at school, and in the community. Without adequate care or prevention, this frequently results in adulthood-long distress and impairment at large societal costs. Determining the prevalence of ADHD cases among preschoolers as well as some associated maternal and child risk factors was the aim of this study. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study including 1048 preschool children aged 3–6 years was carried out in Tanta City, Gharbia Governorate. From March to April 2022, a proportionate stratified cluster random sample of them was picked. Data were gathered using a predesigned instrument that included sociodemographic information, family history, maternal and child risk factors, and the Arabic version of the ADHD Rating Scale IV questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of ADHD among preschoolers was 10.5%. The inattention type was the most common (5.3%), followed by the hyperactivity type (3.4%). There were statistically significant associations regarding positive family history of psychological and neurological symptoms (17.9% positive vs. 9.7% negative), family history of ADHD symptoms (24.5% positive vs. 9.4% negative), active smoking by the mother (21.1% positive vs. 5.3% negative), cesarean section delivery (66.4% positive vs. 53.9% negative), elevated blood pressure during pregnancy (19.1% positive vs. 12.4% negative), and history of taking drugs during pregnancy (43.6% positive vs. 31.7% negative). Significant child risk factors were: exposure to any source containing lead that causes slow poisoning (25.5% positive vs. 12.3% negative), children with cardiac health problems (38.2% positive vs. 16.6% negative), and hours spent by a child in front of the TV or mobile phone (any screens) per day (60.0% of those with positive screening spent more than 2 h/day vs. 45.7% negative). Conclusion: In the Gharbia governorate, 10.5% of preschoolers suffer from ADHD. Significant maternal risk factors for ADHD included a positive family history of psychiatric and neurological symptoms, a family history of ADHD symptoms, active maternal smoking, caesarean section delivery, increased blood pressure during pregnancy, and a history of drug use during pregnancy. Youngsters who had cardiac health issues and who spent more time each day watching TV or using a mobile device (screen use) were at substantial risk.

        <ab>There is limited knowledge about the effects of antipsychotic exposure on the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women with mental illness. Studies have demonstrated an association between antipsychotic medications and metabolic problems such as weight gain and diabetes mellitus in non-pregnant patients with psychiatric disorders. GDM increases the risk of adverse maternal outcomes, including pregnancy-induced hypertension, antepartum and postpartum haemorrhage, and caesarean delivery. The National Register of Antipsychotic Medication in Pregnancy (NRAMP) is a prospective Australian cohort study that observed women who took antipsychotics during pregnancy. Data from 205 women were extracted for the final analysis and included women who took first or second-generation antipsychotics (FGA,SGA) during the first trimester of pregnancy (at minimum) and had a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (n = 180). The comparison (non-exposed) group (n = 25) were women with psychosis who chose not to take any antipsychotic during the first trimester (at minimum). The comparison groups were not matched, although groups were homogenous in terms of sex, age range, diagnosis and perinatal status. The results of logistic regression analysis revealed that women who were exposed to FGAs, SGAs were seven and five times, respectively, more likely to develop GDM compared to non-exposed groups. When adjusted for confounding variables such as BMI and family history of diabetes, the potential of developing GDM decreased for women taking SGAs. In conclusion, the risk of developing GDM is lower in women taking SGAs compared with women taking FDAs. In addition, family history of diabetes and BMI adds to the risk.

        <ab>Background and Aims: Smokeless tobacco is a heterogeneous product group with diverse composition and prevalence globally. Tobacco use during pregnancy is concerning due to the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and effects on child health. Nicotine may mediate several of these effects. This systematic review measured health outcomes from Swedish smokeless tobacco (snus) use during pregnancy. Method: Literature search was conducted by an information specialist in May 2022. We included human studies of snus use during pregnancy compared with no tobacco use, assessed risk of bias, conducted a meta-analysis and assessed confidence in effectestimates using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). Results: We included 18 cohort studies (42 to 1 006 398 participants). Snus use during pregnancy probably (moderate confidence in risk estimates) increase the risk of neonatal apnea, adjusted odds ratio 95% confidence interval [aOR (95% CI)] 1.96 (1.30 to 2.96). Snus use during pregnancy possibly (low confidence in risk estimates) increase the risk of stillbirths aOR 1.43 (1.02 to 1.99), extremely premature births aOR 1.69 (1.17 to 2.45), moderately premature birth aOR 1.26 (1.15 to 1.38), SGA aOR 1.26 (1.09 to 1.46), reduced birth weight mean difference of 72.47 g (110.58 g to 34.35 g reduction) and oral cleft malformations aOR 1.48 (1.00 to 2.21). It is uncertain (low confidence in risk estimates, CI crossing 1) whether snus use during pregnancy affects risk of preeclampsia aOR 1.11 (0.97 to 1.28), antenatal bleeding aOR 1.15 (0.92 to 1.44) and very premature birth aOR 1.26 (0.95 to 1.66). Risk of early neonatal mortality and altered heart rate variability is uncertain, very low confidence. Snus using mothers had increased prevalence of caesarean sections, low confidence. Conclusions: This systematic review reveals that use of smokeless tobacco (snus) during pregnancy may adversely impact the developing child.

        <ab>ObjectiveTo investigate the perinatal outcomes in Brazilian, Peruvian, and Colombian women in a Brazilian reference maternity hospital based at Amazon triple border region.MethodA cross-sectional case study of data from 3242 live birth certificates issued at the Tabatinga public maternity hospital, in the countryside of Amazonas, in the period between January 2015 and December 2017. Maternal and perinatal independent variables were analysed based on central tendency and variability, and frequency distribution for categorical variables. The Pearson’s Chi-Square test and univariate analyses were performed to estimate probability ratios (Odds Ratio-OR).ResultsSignificant differences were found in the education level in the three population groups, as well as in the number of previous pregnancies, antenatal consultations, month of initial prenatal care, and type of delivery. Brazilian pregnant women had more prenatal consultations, caesarean sections, and premature births. Peruvian and Colombian women started antenatal care later, and those with high-risk pregnancies tended to deliver in their home country.Conclusion for PracticeOur findings show some singularities in the care of women and infants in the Amazonian triple border region. The Brazilian Unified Health Care System performs an important role in the guarantee of free access to health services, and ensures comprehensive care for women and infants, promoting human rights in border regions regardless of nationality.

        <ab>Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in the use of pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM) by maternal race–ethnicity during postpartum hospitalization using electronic medical records (EMRs). Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study of all live-born infants at our academic research institution from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016, was conducted. EMR data were used to determine whether each infant received mother’s own milk (MOM), PDHM, or formula. These data were stratified based on whether the infant received treatment in the Neonatal Critical Care Center. Generalized estimating equation models were used to calculate the odds of receiving PDHM by maternal race–ethnicity, adjusting for gestational age, birth weight, insurance, preferred language, nulliparity, and mode of delivery. Results: Infant feeding data were available for 7097 infants, of whom 49% were fed only MOM during their postpartum hospitalization. Among the 15.9% of infants admitted to neonatal critical care, infants of non-Hispanic Black (odds ratio [OR] 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31–0.72), Hispanic (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36–1019), and Other (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32–1.26) mothers had lower rates of PDHM feedings than infants of non-Hispanic White mothers in the adjusted models. Among well infants, the use of PDHM was lower among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic mothers (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.18–0.36, and OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26–0.56) compared with non- Hispanic White mothers. Conclusions: Inequities in exclusive human milk feeding and use of PDHM by maternal race–ethnicity were identified. Antiracist interventions are needed to promote equitable access to skilled lactation support and counseling for PDHM use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background and Purpose: Few large-scale studies examine whether maternal myasthenia gravis (MG) is a risk factor for complications during pregnancy and childbirth. This study evaluated whether maternal MG is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. Methods: We conducted a nationwide Swedish register-based cohort study of women who gave birth to singleton infants (≥22 gestational weeks) during 1987–2019. Exposed women were diagnosed with MG before or during the index pregnancy (N = 443). Unexposed women comprised 4249 women without a diagnosis of MG, matched for age, parity, hospital, and year of childbirth. The risks of adverse pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes for women with MG were estimated using regression modeling and presented as adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Results: There was no increased risk of pregnancy complications in women with MG. Women with MG had a spontaneous onset of labor less often than women without MG (69.8% vs. 79.5%; aOR 0.59; p &lt; 0.001) as well as higher labor induction rates and elective cesarean section deliveries (16.0% vs. 12.3%, aOR 1.42; p = 0.02 and 12.0% vs. 8.1%, aOR 1.59; p = 0.009). Infants of women with MG were born on average 2 days earlier (p = 0.002); however, these infants did not have a higher risk of having low APGAR, being small for gestational age, or having a congenital malformation. Conclusion: This first nationwide study of pregnancy in women with MG in Sweden demonstrates reassuring results overall, suggesting generally safe pregnancy outcomes for women with MG and their infants.

        <ab>Objective: Increasing rates of caesarean sections has led to concerns about long-term effects on the offspring’s health, and it has been hypothesised that caesarean section induced differences in the child’s microbiota could potentially increase the risk of mental disorders. Methods: Nationwide Danish cohort study of 2,196,687 births was conducted between 1980 and 2015, with 38.5 million observation-years. Exposure was ‘Caesarean Section’ and outcome was the child’s risk of any mental disorder. Absolute and relative risks (RRs) were estimated using inverse probability weighting to adjust for age, calendar time and confounding variables while accounting for the competing risk of death. Results: Caesarean section (n = 364,908, 16.6%), compared to vaginal birth, was associated with a small RR increase of 8% (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13; n = 44,352) for the development of any in-patient psychiatric admission at age 36 for the offspring and with a small absolute risk difference of 0.47% (95% CI, 0.23–0.76). When looking at all in-patient, out-patient and emergency room psychiatric contacts among people born after 1995, the effect was diminished (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99–1.09; n = 15,211). The risk was comparable when comparing prelabour versus intrapartum caesarean section (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90–1.08) and acute versus planned caesarean section (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80–1.29). Conclusion: Birth by caesarean section was associated with only a very slightly increased risk of any in-patient psychiatric admission for the offspring and diminished even further when including all psychiatric contacts. The very small associations observed may be explained by unmeasured confounding and is unlikely to be of substantial clinical relevance.

        <ab>Background: Policy in many high-income settings supports giving pregnant women with previous caesarean section a choice between an elective repeat caesarean section (ERCS) or planning a vaginal birth after previous caesarean (VBAC), provided they have no contraindications to VBAC. Despite the potential for this choice to influence women's mental health, evidence about the associated effect to counsel women and identify potential targets for intervention is limited. This study investigated the association between planned mode of birth after previous caesarean and women's subsequent use of psychotropic medications. Methods: A population-based cohort study of 31 131 women with one or more previous caesarean sections who gave birth to a term singleton in Scotland between 2010 and 2015 with no prior psychotropic medications in the year before birth was conducted using linked Scottish national datasets. Cox regression was used to investigate the association between planned mode of birth and being dispensed psychotropic medications in the first year postpartum adjusted for socio-demographic, medical, pregnancy-related factors and breastfeeding. Results: Planned VBAC (n = 10 220) compared to ERCS (n = 20 911) was associated with a reduced risk of the mother being dispensed any psychotropic medication [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78–0.92], an antidepressant (aHR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76–0.90), and at least two consecutive antidepressants (aHR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75–0.91) in the first year postpartum. Conclusions: Women giving birth by ERCS were more likely than those having a planned VBAC to be dispensed psychotropic medication including antidepressants in the first year postpartum. Further research is needed to establish the reasons behind this new finding. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Against the backdrop of the alarming rise in Caesarean section (C-section) births in India, this study aimed to examine the association between C-section births, fertility decline and female sterilization in the country. A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the association between C-section delivery and subsequent reproductive behaviour in women in India. Data were from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). The study sample comprised 255,726 currently married women in the age group of 15–49 years. The results showed a strong positive relationship between C-section births and female sterilization. The predicted probabilities (PP) from the multivariate regression model indicated a higher chance of female sterilization in women with C-section births (PP = 0.39, p&lt;0.01) compared with those with non-C-section births (PP = 0.20, p&lt;0.01). Both state-level correlation plots and Poisson regression estimates showed a strong negative relationship between C-section births and mean children ever born (CEB). Based on the results, it may be concluded that the use of C-sections and sterilization were strongly correlated in India at the time of the NFHS-4, thus together contributing to fertility decline. A strong negative association was found between the occurrence of C-sections and CEB. The increased and undesired use of C-section births and consequent female sterilization is a regressive socio-demographic process that often violates women’s rights. Fertility decline should happen through informed choice of family planning and must protect the reproductive rights of women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background In Spain, allowing women to be accompanied by their partners during cesarean deliveries is a poorly consolidated practice. Going through this experience alone, not only deprives women from the opportunity of sharing the birth with their partners, but also, forces them to face, on their own, one of the most stressful experiences during pregnancy. Objective To analyze whether significant differences exist in levels of anxiety of women who receive an elective cesarean delivery, according to whether they are allowed to be accompanied by their partners. Design Quasi-experimental, longitudinal, prospective study, comparing a group of 31 women receiving elective cesarean deliveries, without the presence of their partners, with a group of 33 women with elective cesarean deliveries who were accompanied by their partners. Anxiety levels were assessed using the STAI-State/Trait scale. Participants were given a questionnaire to assess their level of satisfaction with the care received. Results Anxiety measured via total scores on the STAI-S scale was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.004) among the women who were accompanied by their partners during the elective cesarean delivery (median = 25), compared to the group who were not (median = 50). The differences were also significant (p &lt; 0.003) considering the impact of accompaniment upon the group with high scores in the STAI-S (&gt; 31) and continue to be significant when using the cut-off point of very high scores on the STAI-S (&gt; 45). Conclusions Presence of partners during elective cesareans is a key factor for decreasing the anxiety caused by the surgery and for improving the overall experience of cesarean deliveries. Significance What is already known on this subject? Cesarean deliveries are one of the most stressful life experiences. Allowing women to be accompanied by their partners during cesarean deliveries is a poorly consolidated practice in some countries. Otherwise relevant international institutions recommend allowing an accompanying adult, present with the mother in the operating room during the entire process. What this study adds? Presence of partners during elective cesareans is a key factor for decreasing deliveries’ anxiety, improving the overall experience, but it needs a mentality change in the obstetric and surgical team. These results could change the services organization in a more humane delivery, with overall positive impact in the patients’ care. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Birth by Caesarean-section (C-section), which increases the risk for metabolic and immune disorders, disrupts the normal initial microbial colonisation of the gut, in addition to preventing early priming of the stress and immune-systems.. Animal studies have shown there are enduring psychological processes in C-section born mice. However, the long-term impact of microbiota-gut-brain axis disruptions due to birth by C-section on psychological processes in humans is unknown. Forty age matched healthy young male university students born vaginally and 36 C-section delivered male students were recruited. Participants underwent an acute stressor, the Trier social stress test (TSST), during a term-time study visit. A subset of participants also completed a study visit during the university exam period, representing a naturalistic stressor. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests and self-report measures assessing mood, anxiety, and perceived stress. Saliva, blood, and stool samples were collected for analysis of cortisol, peripheral immune profile, and the gut microbiota. Young adults born by C-section exhibit increased psychological vulnerability to acute stress and a prolonged period of exam-related stress. They did not exhibit an altered salivary cortisol awakening response to the TSST, but their measures of positive affect were significantly lower than controls throughout the procedure. Both C-section and vaginally-delivered participants performed equally well on cognitive assessments. Most of the initial effects of delivery mode on the gut microbiome did not persist into adulthood as the gut microbiota profile showed modest changes in composition in adult vaginally-delivered and C-sectioned delivered subjects. From an immune perspective, concentrations of IL-1β and 1L-10 were higher in C-section participants. These data confirm that there is a potential enduring effect of delivery mode on the psychological responses to acute stress during early adulthood. The mental health implications of these observations require further study regarding policies on C-section use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>AimsTo determine what kinds of birth-related experiences of success and failure are described by the participants, and whether there are differences according to fear of childbirth and parity. Studying these experiences is important for understanding the psychological mechanisms behind different childbirth experiences and their impact on maternal mental well-being.MethodsThis was a longitudinal mixed methods study. Descriptions of the birth experiences of 113 Finnish participants were gathered in a survey at 4–8 weeks postpartum and analysed with content analysis. Fear of childbirth was determined antenatally with the Wijma Delivery Expectations scale (W-DEQ A).The number of success and failure expressions were compared between people with FOC and others and between primiparous and multiparous people.ResultsThe contents of the childbirth-related experiences of success and failure were categorised into 12 subcategories, organised under three higher-order categories that were named personal factors, course of childbirth, and support. The most typical expressions of success were in the categories of mode of birth, staff, and mental factors, and the most typical expressions of failure in the categories of staff and mental factors. Experiences of failure were more often expressed by primiparous than multiparous people, but there were no statistically significant differences by FOC. Expressions of success were equally common regardless of parity or FOC.ConclusionPostpartum people categorise aspects of their birth experiences in terms of success and failure. Primiparous people are more susceptible to experiencing failure at childbirth, but possible differences between people with FOC and other people warrant further investigation.

        <ab>Objective: There have been no systematic studies of pregnancy outcomes among women with traumatic brain injury (TBI), potentially limiting informed clinical care for women with such injuries. The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate pregnancy and fetal/neonatal outcomes among women with a TBI diagnosis recorded during their delivery hospitalization compared with women without TBI. Setting: In this cross-sectional study, we identified women with delivery hospitalizations using 2004-2014 data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Health Care and Cost Utilization Project. Participants: We identified deliveries to women with a TBI diagnosis on hospital discharge records, which included all diagnoses recorded during the delivery, and compared them with deliveries of women without a TBI diagnosis. Main Measures: Pregnancy outcomes included gestational diabetes; preeclampsia/eclampsia; placental abruption; cesarean delivery; and others. Fetal/neonatal outcomes included preterm birth; stillbirth; and small or large gestational age. Design: We modeled risk for each outcome among deliveries to women with TBI compared with women without TBI, using multivariate Poisson regression. Models included sociodemographic and hospital characteristics; secondary models added clinical characteristics (eg, psychiatric disorders) that may be influenced by TBI. Results: We identified 3 597 deliveries to women with a TBI diagnosis and 9 106 312 deliveries to women without TBI. Women with TBI were at an increased risk for placental abruption (relative risk [RR] = 2.73; 95% CI, 2.26-3.30) and associated sequelae (ie, antepartum hemorrhage, cesarean delivery). Women with TBI were at an increased risk for stillbirth (RR = 2.55; 95% CI, 1.97-3.29) and having a baby large for gestational age (RR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09-1.56). Findings persisted after controlling for clinical characteristics. Conclusions: Risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including placental abruption and stillbirth, were increased among women with TBI. Future research is needed to examine the association between TBI and pregnancy outcomes using longitudinal and prospective data and to investigate potential mechanisms that may heighten risk for adverse outcomes.

        <ab>Objectives: The aims of this study were to assess trends in maternal age in central China and to examine the relationship between maternal age and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Study design: This was a retrospective and observational study. Methods: Data were analysed from the Wuhan Maternal and Child Health Management Information System, which included all pregnant women who were at 24–42 weeks' gestation, with singleton pregnancies and who lived in Wuhan between 2010 and 2017. Joinpoint regression was used to analyse the trends in mean maternal age and the proportion of women with advanced maternal age. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) disorder, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), caesarean delivery, postpartum haemorrhage, preterm birth, small for gestational age, large for gestational age (LGA) and 5-min Apgar score &lt;7 among women aged &lt;20, 20–24, 30–35 and ≥40 years were compared with women aged 25–29 years using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis and stratified analysis. Results: Among the 583,571 women included in this study, 1.2% were aged &lt;20 years, 20.8% were aged 20–24 years, 47.9% were aged 25–29 years, 22.0% were aged 30–34 years, 6.9% were aged 35–39 years and 1.2% were aged ≥40 years. Between 2010 and 2017, the mean maternal age increased from 27.1 years to 29.7 years, and the proportion of women aged ≥35 years increased from 4.3% to 13.9%. Relative to women aged 25–29 years, women aged ≥30 years carried higher risks of PIH, GDM, caesarean delivery, preterm birth, LGA and 5-min Apgar score &lt;7. Relative to older multiparous women, older nulliparous women were more likely to experience caesarean delivery, preterm birth and 5-min Apgar score &lt;7. Conclusions: The average maternal age and the proportion of advanced maternal age showed increasing trends between 2010 and 2017, which may be related to the relaxation of the one-child policy in China. Older maternal age (≥30 years) is independently associated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes may occur earlier than the commonly used definition of advanced maternal age (≥35 years) and may also differ by parity. Ensuring age- and parity-specific clinical counselling, antenatal surveillance and health interventions may significantly improve pregnancy outcomes in older mothers.

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of antenatal education on birth fear, depression, anxiety, stress, childbirth self-efficacy, and mode of delivery in primiparous pregnant women. This is a single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial, in which we applied the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. The study was conducted in a city in Turkey’s Central Anatolia region, and the data collection process was made between April and September 2019. One hundred and twenty primiparous pregnant women were assigned to either the antenatal education group (n = 60) or the control group (n = 60) via randomized block assignment. A total of 112 women were evaluated at the end of the study. Pregnant women in the antenatal education group were given two 2-hr sessions (240 min) twice a week for 4 weeks. It was found that those in the antenatal education group had less birth fear, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and increased childbirth self-efficacy compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Those in the antenatal education group had significantly lower postnatal birth fear, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). More vaginal births occurred in the antenatal education group compared to controls (p = 0.043). According to the outcome of this evidence-based study: antenatal education has important clinical benefits for women both during pregnancy and in the postpartum period and all pregnant women should receive this education.

        <ab>Objective: Pain is a variably experienced symptom during pregnancy, and women scheduled for cesarean delivery, an increasingly common procedure, are a relatively understudied group who might be at higher pain risk. Although biopsychosocial factors are known to modulate many types of chronic pain, their contribution to late pregnancy pain has not been comprehensively studied. We aimed to identify biopsychosocial factors associated with greater pain severity and interference during the last week of pregnancy. Methods: In this prospective, observational study, 662 pregnant women scheduled for cesarean delivery provided demographic and clinical information and completed validated psychological and pain assessments. Multivariable hierarchical linear regressions assessed independent associations of demographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics with pain severity and pain interference during the last week of pregnancy. Results: Women in the study had a mean age of 34 years, and 73% identified as White, 11% as African American, 10% as Hispanic/Latina, and 6% as Asian. Most women (66%) were scheduled for repeat cesarean delivery. Significant independent predictors of worse pain outcomes included identifying as African American or Hispanic/Latina and having greater depression, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing. Exploratory analyses showed that women scheduled for primary (versus repeat) cesarean delivery reported higher levels of anxiety and pain catastrophizing. Conclusions: Independent of demographic or clinical factors, psychological factors, including depression, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing, conferred a greater risk of late pregnancy pain. These findings suggest that women at higher risk of pain during late pregnancy could benefit from earlier nonpharmacological interventions that concurrently focus on psychological and pain symptoms.

        <ab>ObjectivesWhile the rates of maternal mortality in developed countries have remained low in recent years, rates of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) are still increasing in high income countries. As a result, SMM is currently used as a measure of maternity care level. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of SMM surrounding childbirth.MethodsA nested case-control study was performed between the years 2013–2018. SMM was defined as peripartum hospitalization involving intensive care unit (ICU). A comparison was conducted between parturient with SMM to those without, randomly matched for delivery mode and date of birth in a 1:1 ratio. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the independent association between SMM and different maternal and pregnancy characteristics.ResultsDuring the study period, 96,017 live births took place, of which 144 (1.5 per 1,000 live births-0.15%) involved SMM with ICU admissions. Parturient with SMM were more likely to have a history of 2 or more pregnancy losses (18.2% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.004), deliver preterm (48.9% vs. 8.8%, p &lt; 0.001), and suffer from placenta previa (11.9% vs. 1.5%, p &lt; 0.001), and/or placenta accreta (9.7% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.003). Several significant and independent risk factors for SMM were noted in the multivariable regression models: preterm delivery, history of ≥ 2 pregnancy losses, grand-multiparity, Jewish ethnicity, and abnormal placentation (previa or accreta).Conclusions for PracticeSMM rates in our cohort were lower than reported in developed countries. An independent association exists between peripartum maternal ICU admissions and several demographic and clinical risk factors, including preterm birth and abnormal placentation.

        <ab>Background: Mother–infant bonding is an important factor that supports an infant’s socio-emotional development. Therefore, every family member should acknowledge these processes, especially in an extended family set-up like in Indonesia. The general study objective was to predict several socio-demographic factors associated with mother–infant bonding in Indonesian samples. Method: This is a cross-sectional study. The participants included 168 mothers who had infants aged 0 to 36 months and willingly joined the study by signing the informed consent form. The Indonesian version of mother–infant bonding scale and a socio-demographic questionnaire were administered to all mothers. Logistic regression was applied to identify the socio-demographic factors that had any association with the mother–infant bonding scale. The data were analyzed using the SPSS program version 21 for Mac. Results: The study showed that 13.1% of the participants were categorized as having a moderate-to-high level of impaired mother–infant bonding. Logistic regression analysis showed that vaginal or normal delivery mode was 4.07 (95% CI [1.27, 13.09]) times more likely to exhibit low levels of impaired mother–infant bonding compared to a cesarean section. The model explained 18.6% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in impaired mother–infant bonding and accurately classified 86.9% of cases. Conclusion: The findings support prior studies that have been conducted in several countries. Psychoeducation on supporting mother–infant bonding may consist of several topics, such as the advantages of vaginal delivery mode and the importance of family support. It may be delivered in the early adulthood period and, hopefully, basic knowledge during those periods may help strengthen the understanding of mother–infant dyad issues among all family members.

        <ab>Background: Maternal mental health as an important precursor to reproductive and neonatal complications remains understudied in the United States, particularly in the Southeastern region, despite high medical costs, maternal morbidity, and infant burden. This study sought to estimate the incidence of perinatal mental health disorders and the associated increased risk of leading pregnancy and infant complications. Methods: A population-based retrospective birth cohort of childbirth hospitalizations and readmissions was constructed for women in South Carolina, 1999 to 2017. Prevalence rates were calculated for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), severe mental illness, and mental disorders of pregnancy (MDP). Poisson regression models using generalized estimating equations were used to estimate adjusted relative risks for the association between mental health conditions and severe maternal morbidity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, cesarean section, preterm birth, and low birthweight. Results: The most prevalent maternal mental condition was MDP (3.9%), followed by PMAD (2.7%) and severe mental illness (0.13%). PMAD was associated with a higher risk of severe maternal morbidity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and cesarean section, as well as a higher risk of preterm birth and low birthweight infants. Severe mental illness was associated with low birthweight, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and cesarean section. Pregnant populations with MDP were more at risk for severe maternal morbidity, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, low birthweight, and cesarean section. Each maternal mental health outcome was associated with an increased risk for hospital readmissions up to 45 days after childbirth. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the escalating burden of PMAD and MDP for pregnant populations over time, with important consequences related to maternal and infant morbidity.

        <ab>PurposeTo examine the association between mode of delivery (in particular caesarean section) and behavioural outcomes in offspring at six time-points between age 3 and 17 years.MethodsSimilar to previous work examining the association between mode of delivery and behavioural outcomes in offspring at age 7, we used maternal-reported data from the Millennium Cohort Study. Data on mode of delivery were collected when children were 9 months and categorised as spontaneous vaginal delivery, assisted vaginal delivery, induced vaginal delivery, emergency caesarean section, planned caesarean section and caesarean section after induction of labor. Data on behavioural outcomes were collected at ages 3, 5, 7, 11, 14 and 17 years using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Crude and adjusted logistic regression examined mode of delivery–behavioural difficulties relationship, using validated SDQ cut-off points (total SDQ ≥ 17, emotional ≥ 5, conduct ≥ 4, hyperactivity ≥ 7, peer problems ≥ 4 and prosocial behaviour ≤ 4). Multilevel models with linear splines examined the association between mode of delivery and repeated measures of SDQ.ResultsThere were 18,213 singleton mother–child pairs included at baseline, 13,600 at age 3; 13,831 at age 5; 12,687 at age 7; 11,055 at age 11; 10,745 at age 14 and 8839 at age 17. Adjusted logistic regression suggested few associations between mode of delivery and behavioural outcomes at ages 3, 5, 11, 14 and 17 years using validated SDQ cut-off points. After correction for multiple testing, only the protective association between planned caesarean section-Conduct difficulties at age 5 years (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46, 0.85) and positive association between caesarean section after induction-Emotional difficulties at age 11 years (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19, 2.07) remained statistically significant. Multilevel modelling suggested mean SDQ scores were similar in each mode of delivery group at each time point.ConclusionsResults of this study indicate that mode of delivery is unlikely to have a major impact on behavioural outcomes.

        <ab>Background: Evidence on risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) are fragmented and inconsistent. Aims To assess the strength and credibility of evidence on risk factors of PPD, ranking them based on the umbrella review methodology. Method: Databases were searched until 1 December 2020, for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies. Two reviewers assessed quality, credibility of associations according to umbrella review criteria (URC) and evidence certainty according to Grading of Recommendations-Assessment-Development-Evaluations criteria. Results: Including 185 observational studies (n = 3 272 093) from 11 systematic reviews, the association between premenstrual syndrome and PPD was the strongest (highly suggestive: odds ratio 2.20, 95%CI 1.81–2.68), followed by violent experiences (highly suggestive: odds ratio (OR) = 2.07, 95%CI 1.70–2.50) and unintended pregnancy (highly suggestive: OR=1.53, 95%CI 1.35–1.75). Following URC, the association was suggestive for Caesarean section (OR = 1.29, 95%CI 1.17–1.43), gestational diabetes (OR = 1.60, 95%CI 1.25–2.06) and 5-HTTPRL polymorphism (OR = 0.70, 95%CI 0.57–0.86); and weak for preterm delivery (OR = 2.12, 95%CI 1.43–3.14), anaemia during pregnancy (OR = 1.47, 95%CI 1.17–1.84), vitamin D deficiency (OR = 3.67, 95%CI 1.72–7.85) and postpartum anaemia (OR = 1.75, 95%CI 1.18–2.60). No significant associations were found for medically assisted conception and intra-labour epidural analgesia. No association was rated as ‘convincing evidence’. According to GRADE, the certainty of the evidence was low for Caesarean section, preterm delivery, 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and anaemia during pregnancy, and ‘very low’ for remaining factors. Conclusions: The most robust risk factors of PDD were premenstrual syndrome, violent experiences and unintended pregnancy. These results should be integrated in clinical algorithms to assess the risk of PPD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Little empirical research examines relationships among delivery mode, other childbirth-related factors, maternal characteristics, and child psychosocial development. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the developmental trajectories of toddlers’ emotional and behavioral problems and the predictive role of psycho-social, childbirth, and maternal characteristics. Method: Participants were 258 mothers and their children who took part in a longitudinal study from birth till the age of 30 months. Self-report instruments were used for the assessment of mothers’ infant rearing attitudes, the quality of relationship with the partner, maternal emotional distress, and maternal self-efficacy. The Child Behavior Checklist (1½–5) was used for the assessment of children’s behavioral and emotional problems. Results: Latent class analysis for emotional and behavioral problems ended in 3-class solutions. In regard to emotional problems, 83% of children were classified as having a stable low, 11% an increasing, and 6% a decreasing level of emotional problems. In regard to behavioral problems, 86% of children showed a stable low, 5% an increasing, and 9% a stable high level of behavioral problems. Children’s gender in combination with maternal education and maternal infant rearing attitudes predict children’s membership in the increasing and decreasing emotional problem classes. Children’s gender and maternal age in combination with emergency caesarean section, the quality of the relationship with the partner, and maternal self-efficacy explain children’s membership in the classes of high and increasing behavioral problems. Conclusions: A combination of such factors as emergency caesarean section, child’s gender, maternal age and level of education, maternal infant rearing attitudes, maternal self-efficacy, and inter-parental relationships predict developmental trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in toddlers.

        <ab>Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is inversely correlated with women’s functioning, marital and personal relationships, mother-infant interaction quality, and children’s social, behavioural, and cognitive development. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) in Riyadh and correlate them with possible predictors by a cross-sectional approach. Methods: In this study, 174 mothers receiving treatments in different hospitals of Riyadh completed self-administered measures of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) along with a list of probable predictors. The data was analyzed by logistic regression analysis using SPSS-IBM 25. Results: Of 174 participants of the study, 38.50% (n = 67) reported postpartum depression. Around (115) of the participants were in an age group of 25–45 years with most of them highly educated (101) but unemployed (136). Significant association was noted between occurrence of PPD with unsupportive spouse (P value = 0.023) and recent stressful life events (P value = 0.003). The significant predictors for PPD were unsupportive spouse (OR = 4.53, P = 0.049), recent stressful life events (OR = 2.677, P = 0.005), and Caesarean section as a mode of delivery (OR = 1.958, P = 0.049). Conclusion: The prevalence of PPD among the study participants was high, especially those with recent stressful life event and unsupportive spouse. To promote health and wellbeing of mothers, it was recommended to screen all high-risk mothers for PPD, when they visit hospitals for postnatal follow ups. Prevention of PPD is not only essential for wellbeing of mothers but it is important to provide good conducive atmosphere for the new born.

        <ab>ObjectivesTo characterize pregnant women admitted to Irene Neto Maternity Hospital, Lubango city, Huíla province, and their pregnancy outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a descriptive cross-sectional facility-based survey between October 2016 and September 2017, involving 500 pregnant women, followed from admission in labor until the end of delivery. Mean (SD) was computed for quantitative variables, while relative and absolute frequencies were determined for categorical variables. Additionally, confidence intervals were estimated.ResultsAmong pregnant women 18.3% were adolescents (≤ 19 years) and 14.5% had advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years). Illiteracy was reported by 8.2%. One in three (33.6%) had a short stature (&lt; 1.55 m). Malaria was the most frequent infection during pregnancy (16.3%). Upon admission, 18.1% were anemic (Hb &lt; 11 g/dl) and 36.0% had hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg), contrasting with the few cases reported of chronic hypertension and pregnancy-induced hypertension. There were 15 twin pregnancies. Cesarean section was performed in 25.2% of the women, although there was no medical indication for 23.0% of women having cesareans. Two maternal deaths occurred in our sample. Among live births from singleton pregnancies (97.1%), birth asphyxia (Apgar &lt; 7 at 5 min) was observed in 22.7% and 10.3% had low birth weight (&lt; 2.5 kg).ConclusionsThere are very few studies reporting pregnancy outcomes in Angola. This analysis presents data from Huíla province, the second most populous province. We identified characteristics for higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes: adolescence, illiteracy, and short stature. Among newborn outcomes, birth asphyxia and low birth weight demand special attention. Further research is needed to explore the non-medical indications for cesarean section and to better understand the twinning rate in Lubango.

        <ab>Purpose: To study breastfeeding initiation and continuation rates and identify clinical predictors of breastfeeding initiation related to maternal epilepsy and the newborn's condition among women with epilepsy (WWE). Methods: Data on a cohort of 1195 pregnant WWE from an epilepsy center in Poland from 2000 to 2019 were prospectively collected. Mann-Whitney U and ch2 tests -based comparisons between lactating and non-lactating WWE according to age, week of delivery, Apgar score, birth weight, type of epilepsy, seizure control, major congenital malformation (MCM), mode of delivery, type and dose of antiseizure medication (ASM) were performed. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify predictors of breastfeeding initiation. Results: Among 921 WWE, who gave birth to a living child, 709 (77%) initiated breastfeeding. The annual rate did not significantly change over the study period. Higher breastfeeding initiation rates were associated with vaginal birth (OR = 0.66) and lack of MCM (OR = 0.23). Breastfeeding initiation was less frequent with old-generation ASM monotherapy (OR = 0.36) or polytherapy (OR = 0.33) compared to no ASM treatment. The rate of breastfeeding initiation was positively associated with gestational week and the newborn's condition. At 6 months, about 1/3 of WWE maintained lactation. Conclusion: Approximately ¾ of the WWE cohort initiated breastfeeding. Breastfeeding initiation was associated with delivery mode, treatment type, and the newborn's condition but was not associated with seizures during pregnancy or the individual ASM dose. Further studies are needed to identify additional factors that may negatively affect breastfeeding. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) increases the risk of various acute and chronic morbidities and premature mortality in children under 5 years of age. The present study examines the association between different maternal obstetric factors and PTB. In addition, this study estimates the risk of neonatal mortality among children born preterm. Study design: Retrospective two-stage stratified sample design. Methods: The weighted prevalence of PTB was estimated using data on 148,746 most recent institutional births from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4, 2015–16. The Poisson regression model was used to investigate the association between maternal obstetric factors and PTB. Using Cox's proportional hazard model, the risk of neonatal mortality among PTBs was estimated. Results: Maternal obstetric factors, such as minimal antenatal care, delivery complications, history of previous caesarean delivery and delivery at private health facilities, were significantly associated with an increased risk of PTB. The survival probability of preterm babies sharply declined in the first week of life and thereafter was found to stabilise. The risk of mortality in the first 28 days of life increased 2.5-fold if the baby was born preterm. Optimising antenatal care was found to lower the likelihood of PTB and improve their chances of survival. Conclusion: Antenatal care services and delivery care practices in private facilities were strongly associated with the incidence and survival of PTB. Evaluating associations of history of caesarean births on future pregnancies can help understand their deleterious effects on PTB. Affordable, accessible and available antenatal care services, in both public and private facilities, can increase the survival rates of PTBs.

        <ab>Background: Many psychological and obstetrical factors contribute to the development of postpartum depression. However, little is known about how postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) influences postpartum depressive symptoms. This study explored the relationship between PPH and postpartum depressive symptoms in the Chinese population. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Baoan Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 2016 to June 2020. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess postpartum depressive symptoms. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) between PPH and risk of postpartum depressive symptoms. Results: Of the 7734 respondents, 293 (3.8%) and 7441 were in the PPH and control groups, respectively. Puerperal women with PPH were more likely to screen positive for postpartum depressive symptoms than those without PPH (16.4% vs. 11.7%, p = .016). Adjusting for other covariates, women with PPH still had higher risk of postpartum depressive symptoms (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.16–2.42). Stratification analyses revealed no interaction between PPH and maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index, mode of delivery, and fetal sex in developing depressive symptoms (p for interaction &gt; .05). Conclusions: PPH may increase the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms. Therefore, women with PPH should be actively screened for depressive symptoms in the immediate postpartum period.

        <ab>Background: Fear of childbirth (FOC) is a prevalent issue among pregnant women and significantly relates to adverse outcomes for the mother and child. However, it is not clear the prevalence and risk factors of FOC among pregnant women in a region with a moderate level of economic development in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of FOC among pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy in Lianyungang city, Eastern China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2022 to February 2023 among pregnant women in the third trimester who met the inclusion criteria and visited Lianyungang Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Jiangsu Province, Eastern China. A structured questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, FOC, family function, doctor-patient communication, social support, general self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, insomnia symptoms, and quality of life was used to collect data. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify predictors of FOC. Results: This study included 535 pregnant women in the third trimester. The mean score of FOC was 30.67 ± 10.18, and the median score was 29.00. The prevalence of FOC was 56.64%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that pregnant women with electronic screen exposure time more than 5 h per day (β = 2.02, 95%CI: 0.50–3.53, P &lt; 0.05), no history of cesarean section (β = 2.66, 95%CI: 0.61–4.71, P &lt; 0.05), likes sour food or hates greasy food (β = 1.75, 95%CI: 0.00-3.50, P &lt; 0.05), anxiety (β = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.21–0.80, P &lt; 0.05) and depression (β = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.04–0.57, P &lt; 0.05) were more likely to have a greater level of FOC than their counterparts. However, a significantly lower level of FOC was observed in pregnant women who were multipara (β=-1.64, 95%CI: -3.27–0.01, P &lt; 0.05), not worrying about delivery without family members (β=-3.75, 95%CI: -5.26–2.25, P &lt; 0.001), had good family function (β=-0.32, 95%CI: -0.64–0.00, P &lt; 0.05) and doctor-patient communication (β=-0.33, 95%CI: -0.64–0.02, P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The prevalence of FOC was high in Lianyungang city, Eastern China. FOC is influenced by multiple factors. There is an urgent need to develop interventions to reduce the prevalence of FOC in the third trimester of pregnancy, and to pay attention to pregnant women with risk factors for FOC.

        <ab>Switzerland experiences one of the highest caesarean section rates in Europe but it is unclear why and when the decision is made to perform a caesarean section. Many studies have examined from a medical and physiological point of view, but research from a women's standpoint is lacking. Our aim was to develop a model of the emerging expectations of giving birth and the subsequent experiences of healthy primigravid women, across four cantons in Switzerland. This longitudinal study included 30 primigravidae from the German speaking, 14 from the French speaking and 14 from the Italian speaking cantons who were purposively selected. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews taking place around 22 and 36 weeks of pregnancy and six weeks and six months postnatally. Following Gadamer's hermeneutic, which in this study comprised 5 stages, a model was developed. Four major themes emerged: Decisions, Care, Influences and Emotions. Their meandering paths and evolution demonstrate the complexity of the expectations and experiences of women becoming mothers. In this study, women's narrated mode of birth expectations did not foretell how they gave birth and their lived experiences. A hermeneutic discontinuity arises at the 6 week postnatal interview mark. This temporary gap illustrates the bridge between women's expectations of birth and their actual lived experiences, highlighting the importance of informed consent, parent education and ensuring women have a positive birth and immediate postnatal experiences. Other factors than women's preferences should be considered to explain the increasing caesarean section rates. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate pregnant women's voice their concerns and delivery method preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Methods: A cross-sectional study is survey based using an online survey platform. Three hundred pregnant women were included between 16 May and 12 June 2020 in Turkey. Sociodemographic features, obstetric features, concerns about COVID-19, delivery method preferences, and Brief Measure of Worry Severity were evaluated. Results: It was determined that the concerns of pregnant women about the pandemic were moderate (12.73 ± 6.838) and did not alter their delivery method preferences. However, the concerns of the pregnant women who planned to perform their delivery by caesarean section before COVID-19 and whose delivery method preferences changed during the pandemic process were higher (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, during the COVID-19 period, pregnant women often harbour concerns such as ‘not knowing how it would affect my baby if I have to take medications for COVID-19 (90.3%)’ ‘getting infected by COVID-19 during my pregnancy (89.7%)’ ‘not having a healthy pregnancy until birth (89%)’. Conclusions: Delivery method preferences of pregnant women did not change in the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, COVID- 19 pandemic is impacting on the pregnant women experiencing moderate concerns about their pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period, and their baby.

        <ab>Background/Objectives: While an increased risk for substance use disorders (SUD) and also for several adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery have been well documented when considered separately, an association between these important risk factors has not been investigated. This study explored the potential dependence of these two bariatric surgery-related risks. Subjects/Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study with adult women (18–45) who underwent bariatric surgery between 1996 and 2016 and who gave birth after surgery between 1996 and 2018. The study population consisted of 1849 post-bariatric surgery women with 3010 reported post-surgical births. Subjects with post-surgical, prenatal SUD were identified based on diagnosis codes extracted within the 10 months prior to delivery. Using random-effects logistic regression with retrospective cohort data, preterm birth, low birth weight, macrosomia, Caesarian delivery, congenital anomalies, and neonatal intensive care unit admission were considered as outcomes. Results: About 10% (n = 289) of women had an SUD diagnosis within 10 months prior to child delivery. Women with SUD during pregnancy had significantly more pregnancy and birth complications compared to women without SUD: preterm birth (OR = 2.08, p = 0.03, 95% CI: 1.07–4.03), low birth weight (OR = 3.41, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI: 1.99–5.84), Caesarian delivery (OR = 9.71, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI: 2.69–35.05), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (OR = 3.87, p &lt; 0.01, 95% CI: 2.04–7.34). Women with SUD had lower risk for macrosomia than women without SUD (OR = 0.07, p = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01–0.70). Conclusion: Results from this study demonstrated that post-bariatric surgery women who had SUD during pregnancy had significantly more pregnancy- and birth-related complications than post-surgery pregnant women without SUD, despite the reduction in macrosomia. Where possible, greater prenatal surveillance of post-surgery women with SUD should be considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The definition of women's autonomy used in the study is control over finances, decision-making power, and the extent of freedom of movement by women. Lower autonomy of women affects the socio-economic, emotional, fertility decision, contraceptive use, and sexual life of the women. Thus, this study aimed to assess maternal autonomy and associated factors in making a decision to utilize health services for themselves and neonates in south Ethiopia. Methods: Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from January 1 to March 2, 2021, in Shashamane town. Four hundred ten postpartum mothers were selected using a stratified random sampling technique and interviewed for the survey using questions composed of decision-making autonomy components (decision-making power, control over finances, and freedom of movement). The data were checked for consistency, coded, and entered using EpiData Manager (version 4.6.0.4) and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 26. Descriptive statistics, composite score analysis, and binary and multivariate logistic regression were done to capture the objectives. Result: 410 postpartum mothers were interviewed while the mean and standard deviation of the participants' age was 26.96 ± 5.38. About 48.5% of mothers had high decision-making autonomy for their own and their neonates' health service utilization. Being in monogamous marriage (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.74), and mode of delivery (Cesarean section) (AOR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.18, 3.07) were significantly associated with having high maternal decision-making autonomy. Conclusions: More than half of the study participants had low maternal decision-making autonomy for their own and their neonates' health service utilization. Being in monogamous marriage, and mode of delivery (Cesarean section) were factors significantly associated with high maternal decision-making autonomy. Encouraging mothers to use facility delivery was recommended. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The objective was to assess the continuation and satisfaction of women who had copper IUDs inserted during caesarean delivery, in addition to possible factors associated with device positioning. Materials and methods: A prospective, observational study was carried out involving 158 women who underwent copper IUD insertion during caesarean delivery in Fortaleza, Brazil. The women were followed up 6 weeks and 6 months after insertion of the IUD, at which time they completed a satisfaction questionnaire. We performed speculum and ultrasound examination. Results: IUD continuation rates after 6 weeks and 6 months were 92% and 71.5%, respectively. Approximately 85% and 76% of the women were satisfied with the method after 6 weeks and 6months, respectively. The rate of poor positioning on ultrasound was 5% and the rate of visible thread after 6 weeks was 29.1%, both without association with age, parity, gestational age or active labour. There were 2 cases of infection (1.3%) and no cases of perforation or pregnancy. Conclusions: There was a good rate of continuation and satisfaction with the immediate post-caesarean IUD. There was no association between IUD malpositioning and age, parity, gestational age or active labour. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Our aim was to evaluate variation in opioid prescribing rates and prescription size following childbirth across providers and hospitals. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed claims data from a single-payer Preferred Provider Organization from June 2014 to May 2019 in 84 hospitals in a statewide quality collaborative. All patients aged 12–55 years, undergoing childbirth, with continuous enrollment in pregnancy were included. The primary outcome was the predicted rate of postpartum opioid fills from 7 days before birth to 3 days after discharge. Secondary outcomes included postpartum opioid prescription size in oral morphine equivalents, a standardized measure that includes the number of pills prescribed times the strength of the medication. Multilevel regression models accounted for clustering. We calculated attributable variation in opioid fills using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Of 41,427 births, 15,459 patients (37.2%) filled a postpartum opioid prescription (vaginal, 4,624/27,536 [16.8%]; cesarean, 10,835/13,891 [78.0%]). The median postpartum prescription size was 150 oral morphine equivalents (interquartile range [IQR], 30) (vaginal, 135; [IQR, 45]; cesarean, 150 [IQR, 75]). In adjusted models, the rates of opioid prescribing after vaginal birth differed from cesarean birth (vaginal median, 12.1% [range, 1.1%–60.0%]; cesarean median, 80.4% [range, 43.6%–90.2%]). More variation in postpartum opioid fills was attributable to providers and hospitals for vaginal (provider, 29%; hospital, 24%) than cesarean birth (provider, 8%; hospital, 6%). Variation in prescription size was driven by providers for vaginal birth (provider, 27%; hospital, 6%) and providers and hospitals for cesarean birth (provider, 29%; hospital, 21%). Conclusions: Across a statewide quality collaborative, variation in postpartum opioid prescribing is attributable to providers and hospitals. Future efforts at the provider and hospital levels are needed to implement best practices for postpartum opioid prescribing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. It occurs when blood loss exceeds 1000mL regardless of the delivery route. Careful assessment of various causes and risk factors of PPH is essential to reduce and prevent further complications, avoid maternal morbidity and mortality, and better manage PPH. This study aimed to examine the associations of hospital characteristics and regions of hospital locations across the United States with PPH risk, as the outcomes of such an assessment may contribute to practice-relevant scientific evidence to improve policies and protocols regarding effective PPH management. Methods: This retrospective study used the 2018 National Inpatient Sample database from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) to examine the associations of PPH risk with characteristics and regions of hospital lections. Results: After controlling for clinical risk factors, the results showed that hospitals owned by private investors had significant associations with decreased risk of PPH. Conversely, large bed size, urban teaching status, and West and Midwest location were associated with an increased risk of PPH. Conclusion: Additional research is needed to determine whether these variations across regions and hospital characteristics are due to differences in obstetric practice and management.

        <ab>Background: Although there has been an increase in reports regarding the association between perinatal risk factors and mother–infant bonding, the results have been inconsistent. Methods: This is an ongoing cohort designed study to measure the effect of environmental factors on children's health with the use of data from the Japan Environment and Children's Study. We investigated mother–infant bonding at 1 year old according to parity and mode of delivery. Results: A total of 82,540 participants, including 36,662 primipara mothers and 45,878 multipara mothers, were analyzed in the present study. Exclusive breastfeeding, marriage, and non-working factors were higher in multipara mothers than in primipara mothers. The total Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale Japanese version (MIBS-J) score was higher (worse) in primipara than multipara (mean total: 1.129 vs. 0.897, p &lt; 0.001). Primipara mothers also had higher anger and rejection scores than multipara mothers. When we analyzed only multipara mothers without any history of previous Cesarean section (CS), MIBS-J scores were higher in Cesarean delivery mothers than vaginal delivery mothers (p = 0.038). Limitations: We used a self-reported bonding measure. Although a self-report measure is convenient and important, an observer rating may be less susceptible to bias in perception. We did not distinguish elective CS from emergency CS, which may have different influences on mother–infant bonding. Conclusions: Primipara mothers showed worse mother–infant bonding than multipara mothers, regardless of mode of delivery. Caesarian delivery itself appears to have little effect on mother–infant bonding. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Prior studies have found higher proportions of cesarean deliveries and longer postpartum hospital stays among women with disabilities compared to women without disabilities. However, no research has assessed how length of stay may differ for women with different types of disability while also considering mode of delivery. Objective: To examine the association of disability status and disability type with length of stay, taking into account disability-related differences in mode of delivery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked maternal and infant hospital discharge and vital records data for all births in California between 2000 and 2012 (n = 6,745,201). We used multivariable regression analyses to assess association of disability status and type with prolonged length of stay (&gt; 2 days for vaginal delivery or &gt; 4 days for cesarean) while controlling for covariates. Results: Women with disabilities had significantly elevated adjusted odds of prolonged length of stay compared to women without disabilities (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.32–1.49). Adjusted odds were highest for women with vision disabilities (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.46–1.90), followed by women with IDD (aOR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.30–1.80), and women with physical disabilities (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.32–1.50). Women with hearing disability had the lowest adjusted odds of prolonged length of stay (aOR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.03–1.33). Conclusions: Prolonged length of stay did not appear to be due solely to the higher proportion of cesarean deliveries in this population. Further research is needed to better understand the reasons for prolonged length of stay among women with disabilities and develop strategies to assist women with disabilities in preparing for and recovering from childbirth.

        <ab>Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize current diabetes screening practices in the first trimester of pregnancy in the United States, evaluate patient characteristics and risk factors associated with early diabetes screening, and compare perinatal outcomes by early diabetes screening. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of US medical claims data of persons diagnosed with a viable intrauterine pregnancy and who presented for care with private insurance before 14 weeks of gestation, without pre-existing pregestational diabetes, from the IBM MarketScan® database for the period January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate perinatal outcomes. Results: A total of 400,588 pregnancies were identified as eligible for inclusion, with 18.0% of persons receiving early screening for diabetes. Of those with laboratory order claims, 53.1% underwent hemoglobin A1c testing, 30.0% underwent fasting glucose testing, and 16.9% underwent oral glucose tolerance testing. Compared with those who did not undergo early diabetes screening, those who did were more likely to be older; obese; having a history of gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, or hyperlipidemia; and having a family history of diabetes. In adjusted logistic regression, history of gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio 3.99; 95% confidence interval 3.73–4.26) had the strongest association with early diabetes screening. Adverse perinatal outcomes, including a higher rate of cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes, occurred more frequently among women who underwent early diabetes screening. Conclusions: First-trimester early diabetes screening was mostly commonly performed by hemoglobin A1c evaluation, and persons who underwent early diabetes screening were more likely to experience adverse perinatal outcomes.

        <ab>Objective To assess the postpartum depression (PPD) risk in women with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and moderators. Methods We identified observational studies of PPD rates in women with versus without PPH in Embase/Medline/PsychInfo/Cinhail in 09/2022. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle‐Ottawa‐Scale. Our primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence intervals [95%CI]) of PPD in women with versus without PPH. Meta‐regression analyses included the effects of age, body mass index, marital status, education, history of depression/anxiety, preeclampsia, antenatal anemia and C‐section; subgroup analyses were based on PPH and PPD assessment methods, samples with versus without history of depression/anxiety, from low‐/middle‐ versus high‐income countries. We performed sensitivity analyses after excluding poor‐quality studies, cross‐sectional studies and sequentially each study. Results One, five and three studies were rated as good‐, fair‐ and poor‐quality respectively. In nine studies (k = 10 cohorts, n = 934,432), women with PPH were at increased PPD risk compared to women without PPH (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.44, p &lt; 0.001), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 98.9%). Higher PPH‐related PPD ORs were estimated in samples with versus without history of depression/anxiety or antidepressant exposure (OR = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.18 to 1.60, k = 6, n = 55,212, versus 1.06, 95%CI = 1.04 to 1.09, k = 3, n = 879,220, p &lt; 0.001) and in cohorts from low‐/middle‐ versus high‐income countries (OR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.37 to 1.61, k = 4, n = 9197, versus 1.13, 95%CI = 1.04 to 1.23, k = 6, n = 925,235, p &lt; 0.001). After excluding low‐quality studies the PPD OR dropped (1.14, 95%CI = 1.02 to 1.29, k = 6, n = 929,671, p = 0.02). Conclusions Women with PPH had increased PPD risk amplified by history of depression/anxiety, whereas more data from low‐/middle‐income countries are required.

        <ab>Objective: To estimate the risk of postpartum depression (PPD) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and assess related moderators. Methods: Observational studies reporting on PPD rates in women with vs. without PCOS were identified in Embase/Medline/PsychInfo/Cinhail in 03/2021 since data inception. Quality of studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale. The primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence intervals [95%CI]) of PPD in women with vs. without PCOS. Meta-regression analyses included the effects of age, body mass index, percent smokers, history of depression, preterm delivery, hypertension during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and cesarian section as well as subgroup analyses based on the assessment methods for PCOS and PPD. Sensitivity analyses after excluding poor quality studies and cross-sectional studies and sequentially excluding each study were performed. Results: One study was rated as good, two as fair and three as low-quality. In six studies (n = 934,922), 44,167 women with PCOS were at increased PPD risk compared to 890,755 women without PCOS (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.18 to 1.79, p &lt; 0.001). When excluding one study that underestimated PCOS prevalence, we estimated an OR of 1.59 (95%CI = 1.56 to 1.62, p &lt; 0.001) with reduced heterogeneity (I² = 45.3%). Higher ORs of PPD in women with PCOS were moderated by lower percentage of preterm delivery (co-efficient -0.07, 95%CI = -0.1 to -0.04, p &lt; 0.001). After excluding low-quality studies yielded an OR of 1.58 (95%CI = 1.56 to 1.59, p &lt; 0.001) with heterogeneity dropping (I² = 14.0%). Limitations: The methodological heterogeneity of available studies. Conclusions: Women with PCOS are at elevated PPD risk with risk moderators requiring further research.

        <ab>Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders for women after delivery. The establishment of an effective PPD prediction model helps to distinguish high-risk groups, and verifying whether such high-risk groups can benefit from drug intervention is very important for clinical guidance. Methods: We collected data of parturients that underwent a cesarean delivery. The Control group was divided into a training cohort and a testing cohort. Six different ML models were constructed and we compared their prediction performance in the testing cohort. For model interpretation, we introduced SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Then, training cohort, ketamine group and dexmedetomidine (DEX) group were classified as high or low risk for PPD by the model. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare the incidence of PPD between two groups in different risk cohorts. Results: Extreme gradient enhancement (XGB) had the best recognition effect, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.789 (95 % CI 0.742–0.836) in the training cohort and 0.744 (95 % CI 0.655–0.823) in the testing cohort, respectively. A threshold of 21.5 % PPD risk probability was determined. After PSM, the results showed that the incidence of PPD in the two intervention groups was significantly different from the control group in the high-risk cohort (P &lt; 0.001) but not in the low-risk cohort (P &gt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the XGB algorithm provided a more accurate in prediction of PPD risk, and it was beneficial to receive early intervention for the high-risk groups distinguished by the model.

        <ab>Background: Sexual health has been identified as an important factor for postpartum quality of life. Although pregnancy-related changes in anatomy and metabolism return to their prepregnancy state, female sexual function may not be at the level it was before birth because of physical and psychological changes. Aim: The goal of our study was to explore the influence of the mode of delivery, perineal injury, and peripartum expectations on postpartum sexual function. Methods: Between 2013 and 2018, 522 women were enrolled in this prospective investigation. At time of recruitment during the peripartum hospitalization, patients completed a standardized questionnaire addressing expectations concerning postpartum sexuality with focus on expected influence of the mode of delivery. Sexual function was evaluated using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ) at time of recruitment to evaluate baseline sexual function (4 weeks before pregnancy). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Outcomes: Peripartum expectations, influence of the mode of delivery, and perineal injury were analyzed for their impact on women’s sexual function within 12 months postpartum by repetitive FSFI and SAQ assessments. Results: A total of 522 women with 263 spontaneous vaginal deliveries, 41 operative vaginal deliveries, and 218 cesarean sections were analyzed. Although the data demonstrate a significant postpartum decline in sexual function at 3 and 6 months postpartum, sexual functioning converges to baseline prepregnancy values 12 months postpartum. This observation was independent of the mode of delivery and perineal injuries with no significant between-group differences at any of the analyzed time points. Apart from breastfeeding, for which negative anticipations resulted in impaired sexuality, women’s expectations (pertaining to quantity and quality of female orgasm, partner’s sexuality, fear of altered sexuality, frequency of intercourse, the mode of delivery) do not influence female sexual function at 12 months postpartum. Clinical Implications: Deciphering the potential influence of patient expectations as well as pregnancy- and childbirth-related aspects on female postpartum sexuality will help in the effort to improve women’s postpartum sexual health. Strengths &amp; Limitations: As a strength of this study, postpartum sexuality was independently assessed with 2 different scoring systems (FSFI and SAQ). Limitations include that our follow-up is incomplete and amounts to about 2-thirds of patients who were initially recruited. Conclusion: The mode of delivery and perineal trauma do not influence women’s postpartum sexual function. With the exception of breastfeeding, peripartum expectations do not result in altered sexual functioning at 12 months postpartum. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess the attitudes of intrapartum clinicians about elective induction of labor before and after A Randomized Trial of Induction Versus Expectant Management (ARRIVE) and to assess the effect of different attitudes on patient safety culture. Design: Repeated cross-sectional design. Setting: Online surveys. Participants: Clinicians (883 nurses and 201 physicians in the before-ARRIVE group and 1,741 nurses and 574 physicians in the after-ARRIVE group) who provided intrapartum care at 35 hospitals in California in 2017 and 57 hospitals in Michigan in 2020 and participated in statewide quality improvement efforts to reduce use of cesarean. Methods: We used annual nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex cesarean rates to stratify hospitals into performance quartiles. We used cumulative proportional odds logistic regression to examine induction attitudes before and after ARRIVE by role and hospital performance quartile as well as induction attitudes and patient safety culture among clinicians. We used content analysis to examine qualitative data. Results: After ARRIVE, physicians’ attitudes shifted in favor of induction at hospitals within the top three performance categories (top quartile: M = 3.48 vs. 2.81, p &lt; .0001), whereas nurses’ attitudes did not change (p = .388). After ARRIVE, attitudes among clinicians were more aligned at hospitals with stronger patient safety cultures. Qualitative themes included The Timing of Induction is Important, Who Should Have Inductions, Need for Clear Protocols and More Staff, and Ideas to Improve the Induction of Labor Process. Conclusion: Physician attitudes about induction were significantly different before versus after ARRIVE, whereas nurse attitudes were not. Differences in attitudes may erode the quality of team-based care; intentional interdisciplinary engagement is essential when implementing ARRIVE findings.

        <ab>Aims and objectives To evaluate and quantify the best available evidence regarding risk factors for severe perineal lacerations. Background Many studies have evaluated the risk factors for severe perineal lacerations. However, the results of those studies are inconsistent, and meta‐analysis which thoroughly evaluates the risk factors for severe perineal lacerations is still lacking. Design Systematic review and meta‐analysis of cohort studies based on the PRISMA guideline. Methods PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP and SinoMed were systematically searched for cohort studies reporting at least one risk factor for severe perineal lacerations from 1 January 2000 to 2 June 2021. Two reviewers independently conducted quality appraisal by NOS scale and extracted data. Data synthesis was conducted via RevMan 5.3 using a random‐effects or fixed‐effects model. Results A total of 47 studies with 7,043,218 women were included. The results showed that prior caesarean delivery (OR: 1.46, 95% CI 1.12–1.92) and pre‐pregnant underweight (OR: 1.31, 95% CI 1.22–1.41) significantly increased the risk of severe perineal lacerations. The results also demonstrated that episiotomy was protective against severe perineal lacerations in forceps delivery (OR: 0.56, 95% CI 0.42–0.74), but not spontaneous vaginal delivery (OR: 1.30, 95% CI 0.81–2.07) or vacuum delivery (OR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.45–1.28). Nulliparity, foetus in occipitoposterior or occipitotransverse position, and midline episiotomy were also independent risk factors for severe perineal lacerations. Conclusions Severe perineal lacerations are associated with many factors, and evidence‐based risk assessment tools are needed to guide the midwives and obstetricians to estimate women's risk of severe perineal lacerations. Relevance to clinical practice This systematic review and meta‐analysis identified some important risk factors for severe perineal lacerations, which provides comprehensive insights to guide the midwives to assess women's risk for severe perineal lacerations and take appropriate preventive measures to decrease the risk.

        <ab>Background: Caesarean section birth may be associated with overweight in childhood; however, findings to date have been inconsistent. This study explored the association of caesarean section vs. vaginal birth with childhood overweight in Vietnam. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study explored the association of delivery mode with overweight, obesity, and overweight/or obesity at 8 years of age in children (n = 1937) across 20 sites in Vietnam, using Young Lives longitudinal cohort study data. Categories were defined using BMI z-scores in relationship to the World Health Organization (WHO) reference median: overweight &gt;1 and &lt;2 standard deviations (SD) above WHO reference median, obese &gt;2 SD, and overweight/or obese &gt;1 SD. Individual questionnaire data collected sociodemographic information and pregnancy/birth information through face-to-face interviews with mothers/caregivers. Anthropometric measurements for mother and child were collected at baseline and at 8 years for children. Results: Adjusted multivariable logistic models revealed a twofold increase in odds at age 8 years of overweight [odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.03–3.2, p = 0.039], obese (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.2–4.0, p = 0.014), or overweight/or obese (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3–3.3, p = 0.002) for children born through caesarean section compared with vaginal birth. Children born through planned caesarean section (adjusted OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.1, p &lt; 0.001) and unplanned caesarean section (adjusted OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.5, p = 0.03) had similar increased odds of overweight/or obesity compared with children born through vaginal birth. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there may be an association between caesarean section and childhood overweight even after adjustment for confounders. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of this finding. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Reports an error in 'Perinatal health in Amazon triple border region: Cross-sectional analysis comparing outcomes in the Brazilian, Peruvian and Colombian population' by Camila Soares Teixeira, Tiótrefis Gomes Fernandes, Marcos Augusto Bastos Dias, Milene da Silva Morais das Neves, Julio César Schweickardt, Matthew J. Harris and Rodrigo Tobias de Sousa Lima (Maternal and Child Health Journal, 2023[Oct], Vol 27[10], 1876-1884). In the original article, there were some errors in the Acknowledgements section and copyright holder name. The corrections are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2023-80695-001[/rid]). Objective: To investigate the perinatal outcomes in Brazilian, Peruvian, and Colombian women in a Brazilian reference maternity hospital based at Amazon triple border region. Method: A cross-sectional case study of data from 3242 live birth certificates issued at the Tabatinga public maternity hospital, in the countryside of Amazonas, in the period between January 2015 and December 2017. Maternal and perinatal independent variables were analysed based on central tendency and variability, and frequency distribution for categorical variables. The Pearson’s Chi-Square test and univariate analyses were performed to estimate probability ratios (Odds Ratio-OR). Results: Significant differences were found in the education level in the three population groups, as well as in the number of previous pregnancies, antenatal consultations, month of initial prenatal care, and type of delivery. Brazilian pregnant women had more prenatal consultations, caesarean sections, and premature births. Peruvian and Colombian women started antenatal care later, and those with high-risk pregnancies tended to deliver in their home country. Conclusion for Practice: Our findings show some singularities in the care of women and infants in the Amazonian triple border region. The Brazilian Unified Health Care System performs an important role in the guarantee of free access to health services, and ensures comprehensive care for women and infants, promoting human rights in border regions regardless of nationality. Significance The triple frontier between Brazil, Colombia, and Peru is a region that has specificities that defy assistance flows, normally based on predominantly urban and locally fixed populations. Analysis of the live birth certificate data completed after the births that took place in the only public maternity hospital in this region could help to quantify and understand the migratory phenomenon and its repercussions on the health of women and their infants. Studies show that maternal and child mortality indicators are sensitive to health conditions and can reveal various aspects of a territory, such as social inequalities, socioeconomic development, and quality of life.

        <ab>ObjectiveTo investigate the association between gestational weight gain (GWG) and perinatal outcomes in pregnant Amazonian women. MethodsData from 1305 mother–child pairs from the MINA-Brazil population-based birth cohort study were used. GWG was classified according to two methods, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and INTERGROWTH-21st standards. Poisson and linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations with perinatal outcomes.ResultsFollowing IOM guidelines (n = 1305), the rates of insufficient and excessive GWG were found to be similar (32%). Excessive GWG was associated with higher new-born birthweight (BW) z-scores; increased risks of macrosomia, large for gestational age (LGA), and caesarean delivery; and lower risks of low birthweight (LBW) and being small for gestational age (SGA). Insufficient GWG was associated with lower new-born BW z-scores. Among women with normal pre-pregnancy body mass indices (BMIs, n = 658), inappropriate GWG was high following both methods (IOM: 41.2% insufficient, 24.8% excessive; INTERGROWTH-21st: 25.2% below − 1 z-score, 16.9% above 1 z-score). Both methods also indicated that new-borns of women with excessive GWG had higher BW z-scores and increased risk of macrosomia and LGA. Women with GWG below the INTERGROWTH-21st standards were more likely to deliver an infant SGA and with lower BW z-scores.ConclusionsInappropriate GWG remains a health concern irrespective of the method used to classify weight gain. GWG above the recommendations of both methods and below the INTERGROWTH-21st standard was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Therefore, INTERGROWTH-21st standards seem to be a better fit for healthy women in this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: We aimed to study whether antipsychotic use during pregnancy is associated with gestational diabetes. Methods: This was a Swedish national register‐based cohort study on the Medical Birth Register and the Prescribed Drug Register including all 1,307,487 singleton births between July 2006 and December 2017. Antipsychotics were divided into first-generation antipsychotics (n = 728), high-risk metabolic second-generation antipsychotics including olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine (n = 1710), and other second-generation antipsychotics (n = 541). The risks for gestational diabetes, foetal growth disturbances, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section and preterm labour were assessed. Women treated during pregnancy were compared to women not treated during pregnancy and to women who used antipsychotics before/after but not during pregnancy. Results: The crude risk ratio for gestational diabetes for women treated with high-risk metabolic second-generation antipsychotics during pregnancy was 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–2.9) compared to untreated pregnant women (n = 1,296,539) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.4–2.5) compared to women treated before/after pregnancy (n = 34,492). After adjustment for maternal factors including body mass index, the risk ratios were 1.8 (95% CI 1.3–2.4) and 1.6 (95% CI 1.2–2.1). Exposed infants had an increased risk of being large for gestational age: adjusted risk ratios 1.6 (95% CI 1.3–1.9) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1–1.6) compared to no maternal antipsychotic use during pregnancy and maternal use before/after the pregnancy. Other antipsychotics were not associated with metabolic risks. Conclusions: Olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine used during pregnancy were associated with increased risks for gestational diabetes and the infant being large for gestational age. Enhanced metabolic monitoring should be considered for pregnant women using these drugs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>
        <ab>The use of second-generation antipsychotics amongst pregnant women is increasing. The side effects of these drugs, for example weight gain and increased blood sugar, are well described for the general population. In particular, olanzapine, quetiapine and clozapine are known to cause these effects. Studies on their effects on blood sugar control in pregnant women have however been conflicting. Pregnancy itself also imposes a risk for increased blood sugar levels and gestational diabetes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of gestational diabetes connected to the use of antipsychotics during pregnancy. The study was nationwide and register based including 1.3 million births in Sweden between July 2006 and December 2017. The rates of gestational diabetes and the infants being small for gestational age or large for gestational age amongst women treated with antipsychotics were compared to the rates in pregnant women who did not receive antipsychotics and to rates in a control group of women treated with antipsychotics before/after but not during pregnancy. Antipsychotics were divided into three groups: (i) first-generation antipsychotics, (ii) high-risk second-generation antipsychotics including olanzapine, quetiapine and clozapine, and (iii) other second-generation antipsychotics. Women treated with high-risk second-generation antipsychotics were found to have an increased risk of gestational diabetes and giving birth to an infant being large for gestational age, both when compared with untreated pregnant women and with the control group. Other antipsychotics were not connected to increased risks of these outcomes. Hence, pregnant women treated with olanzapine, quetiapine or clozapine should be monitored regarding blood sugar levels.

        <ab>Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder linked to functional impairments and adverse health outcomes. We sought to examine the association between pregnant women with OCD and obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in the USA. A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using data provided by pregnant women from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative database of hospitalizations in the USA, from 1999 to 2015. Using diagnostic and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), we identified births and classified women by OCD status. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared for women with and without OCD and multivariate logistic regressions were used to obtain odds ratios (OR) to compare obstetrical and neonatal outcomes between the two groups, adjusting for relevant demographic and clinical variables. Between 1999 and 2015, there were 3365 births to women with OCD, corresponding to an overall prevalence of 24.40 per 100,000 births. Women with OCD were more likely to be older than 25, Caucasian, of higher socioeconomic status, smokers or used drugs and alcohol, and have other comorbid psychiatric conditions. In adjusted models, OCD was associated with a higher risk of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, premature rupture of membranes, caesarean and instrumental deliveries, venous thromboembolisms and preterm birth. Pregnancies in women with OCD are at high risk of adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach should be used to identify high risk behaviours and ensure adequate prenatal follow-up and care be available for those with high risk pregnancies.

        <ab>Objective: To assess the influence of the quality of antenatal care on early breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding among Haitian women. Design: Secondary analysis of a cross-sectional household survey. Setting: Haiti Demographic and Health Survey, 2016 to 2017. Participants: Women (N = 2,489) who were 15 to 49 years of age with children younger than 24 months of age. Methods: We used multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis to examine the independent associations between quality of antenatal care and early breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding. Results: The prevalence of early breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding were 47.7% and 39.9%, respectively. Approximately 76.0% of the participants received intermediate antenatal care. The odds of early breastfeeding initiation were greater among participants who received antenatal care of intermediate quality than among those who did not receive antenatal care, adjusted OR (AOR) = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.13, 2.20]. Additionally, maternal age of 35 to 49 years (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI [1.10, 2.12]) was positively associated with early breastfeeding initiation. Factors negatively associated with early breastfeeding initiation were cesarean birth (AOR = 0.23, 95% CI [0.12, 0.42]), birth at home (AOR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.34, 0.96]), and birth in a private facility (AOR = 0.57, 95% CI [0.34, 0.96]). Factors negatively associated with exclusive breastfeeding were employment (AOR = 0.57, 95% CI [0.36, 0.90]) and birth in a private facility (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI [0.08, 0.52]). Conclusion: Antenatal care of intermediate quality was positively associated with early breastfeeding initiation among women in Haiti, which highlights the influence that care during pregnancy can have on breastfeeding outcomes.

        <ab>Background Suboptimal breastfeeding causes substantial numbers of child morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia. This study was designed to assess suboptimal breastfeeding practice and its associated factors among children age less than two years in South Wollo, northeast Ethiopia. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 636 women-child pairs. The study participants were selected by a multi sage random sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, then it was entered into Epi-Data version 3.1, and exported into SPSS version 24.0 for analysis. A Binary Logistic Regression Model with a backward elimination method was used to determine the association of factors and suboptimal breastfeeding practice of babies at a 95% confidence interval. Result Six hundred and thirty-six participants were included with a response rate of 99.7%. The study showed that 36.3% babies age less than 2 years were received suboptimal breastfeeding. Cesarean delivery [AOR: 8.81; 95% CI (4.92–15.77)], lack of breastfeeding counseling [AOR: 3.22; 95% CI (1.93–5.36)], maternal feeding less than 5 times/day during breastfeeding [AOR: 2.01; 95% CI (1.20–3.34)], child health problems [AOR: 3.57; 95%CI (2.17–5.85)], and babies age less than 6 months [AOR:1.92; 95%CI (1.24–2.97)] were positively associated with suboptimal breastfeeding practice. Conclusion Suboptimal breastfeeding practice is highly prevalent in Ethiopia. Health service-related and socio-cultural factors were associated with the high prevalence of suboptimal breastfeeding practice. Emphasis should be given to the breastfeeding practices of children age less than years in Ethiopia. Moreover, counseling regarding the importance of breastfeeding practices should be strengthened. Significance The finding of this study provides essential information to the zonal health office, regional health bureau, and other health care organizations which helped to design interventional measures for promoting breastfeeding practice in the study area. The study could also provide insight for healthcare professionals to work on improving breastfeeding status in children aged less than two years. Finally, the finding could support the improvement of child health by improving the breastfeeding status. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Significant inequalities still exist between low- and high-income countries regarding access to optimum emergency obstetric care including life-saving emergency caesarean section. These relationships are considerably stronger between population-based caesarean section rates and socio-economic characteristics with poorest households experiencing significant unmet needs persistently. Objective: To explore the characteristics of women receiving emergency C-section using a new, validated definition in Ghana and the Dominican Republic. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Ghana and the Dominican Republic. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine women’s characteristics associated with emergency C-section. Results: This analysis included 2166 women who had recently delivered via C-section comprising 653 and 1513 participants from Accra and Santo Domingo, DR, respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that women, both in Ghana and the DR, were more likely to have an emergency C-section if they did not have a previous C-Section (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 2.45, 95% CI [1.57–3.81]; and aOR: 15.5, 95% CI [10.5–22.90], respectively) and if they were having their first childbirth, compared to women with previous childbirth (aOR: 1.77, 95%CI [1.13–2.79]; and aOR: 1.46, 95%CI [1.04–2.04], respectively). Also, preterm birth was associated with significantly decreased likelihood of emergency C-section compared with childbirth occurring at term in both Ghana and the DR (aOR: 0.31, 95%CI [0.20–0.48]; and aOR: 0.43, 95%CI [0.32–0.58], respectively). Among the Ghanaian participants, having an emergency C-section was positively associated with being referred and negatively associated with being older than 35 years of age. Characteristics such as education, religion, marital status, and residence did not differ between women’s emergency versus non-emergency C-section status. Conclusion: Emergency C-section was found to be significantly higher in women with no prior C-section or those having their first births but lower in those with preterm birth in both Ghana and the DR. Data from additional countries are needed to confirm the relationship between emergency C-section status and socio-economic and obstetric characteristics, given that the types of interventions required to assure equitable access to potentially life-saving C-section will be determined by how and when access to care is being denied or not available.

        <ab>Background: Fear of birth is common and complex, caused by a variety of reasons. The aim was to investigate the prevalence of pre-established reasons in relation to fear, and to identify profiles of women based on their reported reasons behind fear of birth. Methods: A cross-sectional Swedish study of women with self-reported fear of birth who completed an online survey. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used in the analysis of pre-established reasons in relation to self-reported severe fear. A Kappa-means cluster analysis was performed in order to group reasons, that were further investigated in relation to women’s background variables. Results: A total of 1419 women completed the survey. The strongest reason behind fear of birth was to be forced to give birth vaginally. Four clusters were identified and labeled: minor complexity (reference group), relative minor complexity, relative major complexity, and major complexity. Cesarean section preference, previous mental health problems, being younger, primiparity, and exposure to domestic violence were factors related to cluster grouping. Conclusions: Women with fear of birth have various reasons and diverse complexities behind their fear. Health care providers need to investigate these reasons and support pregnant women with childbirth fear, based on their needs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Recently, cranial shape measurements of preterm infants have been performed using handheld three-dimensional (3D) scanners and can now be objectively quantified. Aims: To measure the cranial shapes of Japanese preterm infants at one month of age using a 3D scanner, compare these values with those of healthy term infants, and examine the risk factors for dolichocephaly. Study design: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Subjects: Preterm infants born at &lt; 37 weeks of gestation and staying in the neonatal intensive care unit or visiting an outpatient clinic for a one-month checkup between April 2020 and March 2022. Outcome Measures: A 3D scanner was used to quantify cranial shape. Comparison was made with full-term, one-month-old infants. Results: Ninety-four preterm infants (42 boys) and 165 full-term infants were enrolled. Preterm infants had a significantly lower cephalic index (77.9% and 85.0%, p &lt; 0.01) and a higher incidence of dolichocephaly (54.3% and 13.3%, p &lt; 0.01) compared to term infants. No significant difference in incidence of deformational plagiocephaly was found between the groups (41.5% vs. 47.3%, p = 0.44). The risk of dolichocephaly was significantly higher for female sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.30–8.50), cesarean section (OR, 4.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.23–13.5), and use of mechanical ventilation (OR, 4.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–20.0). Conclusions: Japanese preterm infants at the first month of life had longer heads than full-term infants; the risk factors identified were female sex, cesarean section, and use of mechanical ventilation.

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate objective (saliva cortisol) and subjective (questionnaire) stress levels during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic compared to before the pandemic and their effects on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods: This cohort study included 36 women with low-risk, singleton, term deliveries at a tertiary academic center during the COVID-19 pandemic and 49 who delivered before. Physiological stress was evaluated with salivary cortisol measurements, and emotional stress with stress scale questionnaires (0–10) during active and full dilation stages of labor, and 2-min postpartum. Cord blood cortisol and pH were obtained. Delivery mode, complications, and neonatal outcomes were evaluated. Results: Psychological stress was higher for the COVID-19 group compared to controls during full dilation (6.2 ± 3.4 vs. 4.2 ± 3, p = .009). The COVID-19 group had significantly lower cord cortisol levels (7.3 vs. 13.6 mcg/dl, p = .001). No differences were found regarding salivary cortisol level assessments at active, full dilation and 2-min post-delivery (p = .584, p = .254, p = .829, respectively). No differences were found regarding pH &lt; 7.1 (p = .487), 1- and 5-min Apgar scores &lt; 7 (p = .179) and neonatal weight (p = .958). Conclusions: Women who delivered during COVID-19 pandemic had higher stress levels at full dilation and lower cord cortisol levels, as may be expected after exposure to a chronic stressor.

        <ab>ABSTRACT This cross-sectional observational study was conducted to compare breastfeeding success and breastfeeding self-efficacy levels of mothers who gave birth via vaginal delivery (spontaneous or via epidural analgesia) or cesarean section (under general or spinal anesthesia). The study was conducted between September 2019 and February 2020 in the obstetric clinic. Data were collected using a Data Collection Form, the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF), and the LATCH Breastfeeding Evaluation Tool. Throughout the study, we followed the STROBE Checklist. Mothers who gave birth via spontaneous vaginal delivery had a statistically higher mean Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy score (54.92 ± 7.72; p &lt; .001) than those who gave birth under spinal anesthesia (43.21 ± 10.04; p &lt; .001) and then those who gave birth via cesarean section under general anesthesia (37.39 ± 10.64; p &lt; .001). The difference between the delivery modes in terms of breastfeeding self-efficacy and breastfeeding success scores was statistically significant (respectively, KW = 40.168, p &lt; .001 and KW = 52.420, p &lt; .001). In order to increase the breastfeeding success of mothers who give birth via cesarean section under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, lactation nurses need to strengthen the perception of breastfeeding self-efficacy and provide more breastfeeding support to them compared to mothers who give birth via SVD.

        <ab>Professional students need to train in online interprofessional collaboration (IPC). During a longitudinal evaluation for 2018–2022 of an interprofessional learning (IPL) curriculum, nearly 7000 students from health, social care, and teacher education programs completed indicator questions concerning learning about child-related topics and skills required for IPC during their first, second, and third curriculum years of study. The students worked in student-led IPL groups according to a case-based learning approach. Online IPL yielded lower mean scores than in-person IPL. The decreased learning outcomes from year 2 to year 3 for the IPL initiative are not due to the online delivery mode. The lack of reported progress in the IPL courses is more likely due to students not experiencing a gain in IPL learning outcomes. Significant differences were found between teacher education and child welfare students and health and social care students, reflecting IPC challenges in working life. We conclude that online IPL is forward-looking because candidates must be prepared for online IPC and for helping users, such as children, online. Although our data support that IPL is complex, the learning experience has tremendous transfer value to welfare services because we assume that the same issues will appear in IPC.

        <ab>Background: Childbirth brings many changes to women's life and sexual health. The influence of operative vaginal delivery on sexual function has produced inconsistent results. Aim: To evaluate the effects of mode of vaginal delivery (spontaneous or operative) in postpartum sexual function. Methods: Descriptive prospective study (MOODS- Maternal-neonatal Outcomes in Operative Vaginal Delivery) including 304 women who had a singleton term vaginal delivery (operative or spontaneous in a relation 2:1). Women were invited to answer a questionnaire at 3, 6 months and 1 year postpartum. Outcomes Measurement: A validated questionnaire was applied, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Score, to evaluate effects of operative delivery on sexual health. Sexual dysfunction was defined by FSFI score &lt;26.55. Results: 211 women answered at least one questionnaire. Overall rate of sexual dysfunction was 62%, 43% and 48% at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. At 3 months, total FSFI score was significantly lower in operative vaginal delivery group (mean±SD, 21.3±8.6 vs 24.9±7.9, P = 0.015). Arousal (P = 0.028), orgasm (P = 0.029), satisfaction (P = 0.015) and pain (P = 0.007) FSFI domains were also significantly inferior. At this time, 44% women in spontaneous delivery group and 70% in operative delivery group had sexual dysfunction (P = 0.0002). At 6 months, there were no differences in FSFI scores according the type of delivery. At 12 months, total FSFI score was similar in both groups, but pain domain was significantly lower in operative delivery (P = 0.004). Considering type of instrument (Thierry's Spatulas or Kiwi Vacuum), no differences were found regarding episiotomy, perineal trauma, obstetric anal sphincter injury or postpartum complications. FSFI scores did not differ between the two instruments at any time point. A logistic regression showed that, when controlled for perineal trauma, mode of delivery was independently associated with sexual dysfunction at 3 months (P = 0.02). Clinical Implications: Clinicians should assess women's sexual health during pregnancy and postpartum period in order to enhance their wellbeing. Strengths/Limitations: Strengths include its prospective design, standardized questionnaire and the new perspectives about a different obstetrical instrument (Thierry's spatulas). Limitations include the absence of pre-pregnancy sexual function data and considerable drop-out rate. Conclusion: Sexual dysfunction affects a great proportion of newly mothers and in postpartum period mode of delivery and perineal trauma seem to play an important role. Although there was a progressive reduction over time, prevalence of sexual dysfunction at 6 months and 1 year postpartum was still considerable. The type of obstetrical instrument does not seem to influence short or long-term sexual function. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to 19% of all mothers, with detrimental effects on both mother and child. The antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of plasma oxytocin are well-documented, but it is still disputable whether synthetic oxytocin (synOT) may protect women against postpartum mood alterations. The current study examined the association between synOT intrapartum and maternal mood postpartum using a prospective design. Two hundred sixty women were screened for depressive symptoms in the last trimester of pregnancy and then again 6 weeks and 9 months postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. They also completed Maternity Blues Questionnaire in the first postpartum week. The data concerning the intrapartum interventions and health status of the newborn were extracted from the medical records. Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for a history of depression, mode of delivery, and childbirth experience showed that synOT predicted a significantly lower risk of PPD (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.45–0.95, p = 0.025). The risk factors for PPD included a history of depression (HR = 3.20, 95% CI 2.33–4.40, p &lt; 0.001) and negative childbirth experience (HR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.01–1.90, p = 0.040). Logistic regression adjusted for the same covariates found no significant effect of synOT on maternity blues (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.31–1.32, p = 0.23). While synOT administered intrapartum does not affect maternal mood immediately, it may come to effect some weeks after childbirth to protect mothers from developing PPD symptoms.

        <ab>Purpose: To evaluate the impact of implementing a multimodal plan of care in treating the pain of the postoperative cesarean birth patient that limited opioid exposure. Study Design and Methods: A retrospective medical record review was conducted to evaluate a pain management protocol implemented for postoperative cesarean patients before and after a practice change. Sample included term postoperative cesarean patients ≥ 37 weeks of gestation, who had spinal or epidural, were 18 years or older, gave birth to a singleton newborn, admitted to the maternal child health department, and were prescribed opioids as a postoperative pain management treatment plan. Participants (N = 150) were evaluated based on two groups: n = 75 in the preimplementation group and n = 75 in the postimplementation group. Results: There was a significant difference in the total oral opioid milligrams administered between the pregroup (M = 27.13) and postgroup (M = 8.43), after the practice change (p &lt; .001). There was an increase of nonopioids administered to treat and manage postoperative cesarean pain, Motrin PO (p = &lt; .001) and Tylenol PO (p = .002). Clinical Implications: Fewer milligram equivalents of morphine were administered when postoperative cesarean patients were placed on scheduled nonopioids to treat pain.

        <ab>Background: : Women with Bipolar Disorder (BD) during pregnancy present a negative impact on them and their babies’ health. Caesarean Section (C-Section) is an intervention to reduce complications associated with childbirth, but it also has risks, including maternal infections, anaesthetic and psychological complications. There are few studies that analyse the C-Section rates in women with BD compared to the general population. Methods: : A case–control study was conducted in a general university hospital. 100 pregnant women with BD matched with 100 controls without psychiatric illness who were attending the same hospital at delivery. We compared obstetrical outcomes during pregnancy, Pre/During Labour, onset of labour and mode of delivery specifying the type of C-Section. Results: : Rate of C-Section was significantly higher in BD group compared to the control group (OR=2, 95% CI 1,4–1,6). Case group had more somatic illness (SI) without treatment (P &lt; , 001). BD (P = ,021), primiparity (P = , 003), obstetric complications during pregnancy (P &lt; , 001), obstetric complications during labour (P &lt; ,001), and SI with and without treatment (P &lt; ,001 and P = ,007, respectively) were higher in women that required C- section. Conclusion: : Women with Bipolar Disorder have near two-fold increased risk of C-section than women without Bipolar Disorder of similar age, gestational age and parity. Somatic illness was more prevalent in BD group that required C-section and this relation probably is related to high probability of having somatic comorbidities in patients with BD.

        <ab>Background: Intraoperative pain is a possible complication of neuraxial anaesthesia for caesarean delivery. There is little information available about its incidence, risk factors and physician perception. Methods: Parturients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean delivery were enrolled. Before surgery, parturients were asked about preoperative anxiety on a verbal numerical scale (VNS), anticipated analgesic requirement, postoperative pain levels, Spielberger STATE-TRAIT inventory index, Pain Catastrophizing Scale. After surgery, parturients were asked to answer questions (intraoperative VNS pain). The anaesthesiologist and obstetrician were asked to fill out a questionnaire asking about perceived intraoperative pain. Influence of preoperative anxiety on intraoperative pain (yes/no) was assessed using logistic regression. Mc Fadden's R2 was calculated. The agreement in physician perception of intraoperative pain with reported pain by the parturient was examined by calculating Cohen's kappa and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Results: We included 193 parturients in our analysis. Incidence of intraoperative pain was 11.9%. Median intraoperative VNS pain of parturients with pain was 4.0 (1st quartile 4.0; 3rd quartile 9.0). Preoperative anxiety was not a good predictor of intraoperative pain (p-value of β-coefficient = 0.43, Mc Fadden's R² = 0.01). Including further preoperative variables did not result in a good prediction model. Cohen's kappa between reported pain by parturient and by the obstetrician was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.41) and by the anaesthesiologist was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.48). Conclusions: We found a substantial incidence (11.9%) of intraoperative pain during caesarean delivery. Preoperative anxiety did not predict intraoperative pain. Physicians did not accurately identify parturients’ intraoperative pain. Significance: Intraoperative pain occurred in 11.9% and severe intraoperative pain occurred in 1.11% of parturients undergoing elective caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia. We did not find any preoperative variables that could reliably predict intraoperative pain. Obstetricians and anaesthesiologists underestimated the incidence of intraoperative pain in our cohort and thus, more attention must be put to parturients’ pain.

        <ab>Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of the pregnant population during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. KAP towards COVID-19 was assessed using 21-item questionnaires. A score for each category was calculated and points were summed. The outcome variables of KAP were compared with demographic characteristics. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 19. Results: A total of 377 patients participated in the study. The majority of the patients were multiparous (36.8%) in the age group of 30-40years (42.4%). More than 90% of patients were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and mode of transmission. They were aware of no cure for disease and optimum social distance. Although &lt; 50% of patients truly answered the questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the risk of congenital malformation, vertical transmission, and the effect of infection on the mode of delivery. Regarding attitude and practices,&gt; 90% of patients were anxious about fetal and personal safety, they are using a facemask, sanitizing their hands regularly, and avoiding social gatherings. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis showed statistically significant results among demographic variables (age, parity, family members, occupational status, and source of information). Conclusion: Pregnant patients demonstrated inadequate knowledge regarding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy. However positive attitude and practices on preventive measures were good. This highlights the need for health education for pregnant women for COVID-19 to improve knowledge on a constant basis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives: Postpartum women represent a large population with opioid exposure who also have an increased risk of experiencing mood and anxiety disorders. However, the effect that mood and anxiety disorders have on opioid use postpartum has received little attention in the literature. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association of mood and anxiety disorders with filling opioid prescriptions within the first 3 months postpartum. Methods: A retrospective cohort study (n = 25 279) was completed using claims data for a sample of privately insured women who gave birth in the state of Iowa. The interactive effects of mood and anxiety disorders and delivery mode on filling at least one and two or more opioid prescriptions were examined in logistic regression models. Results: The presence of mood and anxiety disorders among women who delivered vaginally increased their odds of filling at least one opioid fill by nearly 50% (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35‐1.63) and by 20% (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00‐1.43) among women with cesarean delivery. Discussion and Conclusion: Postpartum women with mood and anxiety disorders were more likely to fill opioid prescriptions postpartum compared to women without these conditions. Scientific Significance: This study extends prior research by examining the intersection of risk of mood and anxiety disorders and opioid use postpartum. Findings from this study support the need for future research to identify the drivers of increased opioid use among postpartum women with mood and anxiety disorders.

        <ab>Objective: To compare cesarean delivery rates and indications by race/ethnicity among nulliparous women with term, singleton, vertex presentation deliveries. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of nulliparous women delivering term, singleton, vertex neonates at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 1/1/2016 to 6/30/2017. Women with cesarean for elective, malpresentation, or previa were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for maternal, neonatal, and facility factors were used to assess the likelihood of cesarean by race/ethnicity. Further modeling was performed to examine odds of cesarean for the indications of failure to progress and fetal intolerance by race/ethnicity. Results: The cohort of 16,587 racially/ethnically diverse women meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria consisted of 41.62% White, 27.73% Asian, 22.11% Hispanic, 5.32% Black, and 3.21% multiple race/other women. In adjusted logistic regression models, all race and ethnic categories had higher odds of cesarean deliveries in comparison to White women. Black women had the highest odds of cesarean delivery (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.45–2.06), followed by Asian (aOR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.45–2.06), multiple race/other (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.17–1.80), and Hispanic (aOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.28–1.59) women. Compared with White women, Asian (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.22–1.74) and Hispanic (aOR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03–1.52) women had higher odds of failure to progress as the indication. Among women with failure to progress, Black (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30–0.81), Hispanic (aOR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53–0.87), and Asian (aOR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61–0.96) women were less likely than White women to reach 10 cm dilation. Compared with White women, Black women were more likely to have cesarean delivery for fetal intolerance (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10–2.07). Among women with fetal intolerance of labor, there were no significant differences by race/ethnicity for Apgar score or neonatal intensive care unit admission. Conclusions: Race/ethnicity was significantly associated with the odds of cesarean and indication. All other race/ethnicity groups had higher odds of cesarean compared with White women. Compared with White women, Black women had greater odds of fetal intolerance as an indication, while Hispanic and Asian women had greater odds of failure to progress. Maternal, neonate, and facility factors for cesarean delivery did not explain the observed disparities in cesarean delivery rates. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Though interest is growing for trials comparing planned delivery mode (vaginal delivery [VD]; cesarean section [CS]) in low-risk nulliparous women, appropriate study design is unclear. Our objective was to assess feasibility of three designs (preference trial [PCT], randomized controlled trial [RCT], partially randomized patient preference trial [PRPPT]) for a trial comparing planned delivery mode in low-risk women. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of low-risk, nulliparous pregnant women (N = 416) and healthcare providers (N = 168) providing prenatal care and/or labor/delivery services was conducted in Argentina (2 public, 2 private hospitals). Proportion of pregnant women and providers willing to participate in each design and reasons for not participating were determined. Results: Few women (&lt; 15%) or professionals (33.3%) would participate in an RCT, though more would participate in PCTs (88% women; 65.9% professionals) or PRPPTs (44.4% public, 63.4% private sector women; 44.0% professionals). However, most women would choose vaginal delivery in the PCT and PRPPT (&gt; 85%). Believing randomization unacceptable (RCT, PRPPT) and desiring choice of delivery mode (RCT) were women’s reasons for not participating. For providers, commonly cited reasons for not participating included unacceptability of performing CS without medical indication, difficulty obtaining informed consent, discomfort enrolling patients (all designs), and violating women’s right to choose (RCT). Conclusions for Practice: Important limitations were found for each trial design evaluated. The necessity of stronger evidence regarding delivery mode in low-risk women suggests consideration of additional designs, such as a rigorously designed cohort study or an RCT within an obstetric population with equivocal CS indications.

        <ab>Purpose: Studies have reported children born by caesarean section are more likely to have lower cognitive outcomes compared to those born by vaginal delivery. This paper reviews the literature examining caesarean birth and offspring cognitive outcomes. Methods: A systematic search for observational studies or case–control studies that compared cognitive outcomes of people born by caesarean section with those born by vaginal delivery was conducted in six databases (Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science) from inception until December 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were assessed for quality and a narrative synthesis was undertaken considering the evidence for a causal relationship according to the Bradford Hill Criteria. Results: A total of seven studies were identified. Of these, four found a significant association between elective and emergency caesarean birth and reduction in offspring cognitive performance as measured by school performance or validated cognitive testing. Three studies found no association. There was variability in the quality of the studies, assessment of the reason for caesarean section (emergency vs elective), measurement of outcomes and adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusion: The evidence of an association between CS birth and lower offspring cognitive functioning is inconsistent. Based on currently available data, there is no evidence that a causal association exists. To better examine this association, future studies should (a) distinguish elective and emergency caesareans, (b) adequately adjust for confounding variables and (c) have valid outcome measures of cognition.

        <ab>Objectives: To report regional maternal and infant health characteristics in the Louisiana American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive analysis using 2016–2019 Louisiana birth certificate data (N = 242,359; 3205 AIAN births). Prevalence of health characteristics and disparities from population averages were calculated. Health characteristics included low birth weight, preterm birth, very low birth weight, very preterm birth, high birth weight, NICU admission, breastfeeding at discharge, rurality, cesarean section, inadequate prenatal care, and maternal smoking. Results: Low birth weight prevalence ranged from 5.7% in central Louisiana to 20.7% in northeast Louisiana. Most other infant outcomes followed a similar pattern. Disparities from regional averages also varied. AIAN infants had 8% higher risk of LBW than the northeast Louisiana average and 4% lower risk in central Louisiana. Maternal smoking was most prevalent in northern and western Louisiana. Across Louisiana, maternal smoking was as or more prevalent in mothers of AIAN infants compared to regional averages. Conclusions for Practice: There is substantial regional variability in maternal and infant health characteristics in Louisiana AIAN populations, motivating emphasis on locally focused epidemiology to better serve Indigenous communities.

        <ab>We aimed to assess the feeding pattern and influencing factors within six weeks postpartum on exclusive breastfeeding duration among Chinese mothers. This study was conducted using 2:1 matched case-control study. Cases and controls were matched for maternal age, parity and mode of birth. A total of 210 women were included. Approximately 67.9% of women stopped exclusive breastfeeding within the first six weeks postpartum. Maternal non-exclusive breastfeeding intention, lower maternal educational level, mother-infant skin to skin contact over one hour, unsatisfied breastfeeding self-evaluation and maternal unhealthy condition within the first six weeks were risk factors for ceasing exclusive breastfeeding early.

        <ab>The mother's first meeting with the baby after the caesarean section is usually delayed due to the reasons arising from the mother and the baby in Turkey. Although there are many benefits of kangaroo care (KC) intervention between the mother and the newborn, there is a limited number of studies on the KC intervention between the newborn and the father after caesarean section in international literature, and there are none in Turkey. This study was carried out to determine the effect of fathers and infants who participated in KC, immediately after birth by caesarean section, on paternal–infant attachment and the fathers' involvement in infant care in the 12th month. The study was conducted as a longitudinal study with a control group. Initially, the sample consisted of 60 fathers. However, the study was completed with 48 fathers. KC intervention was practised to the couple of the father and the infant in the experimental group, while no practice was given to the control group. Fathers in the experimental group were told that they should continue to practice KC intervention at least two times a week until their baby will be 1‐year‐old. The data collection forms were given to fathers face‐to‐face in the first interview, and then through phone calls and emails after 12 months. The status of the fathers in the experimental group fathers' involvement in infant care of the baby (p = .005) was significantly higher than the control group. The mean score for the Postnatal Paternal‐Infant Attachment Questionnaire (PPAQ), in fathers who participated in KC intervention, was higher than that of fathers who did not participate in the KC intervention (p &lt; .005). The results of this study demonstrated that the paternal–infant attachment and the fathers' participation in infant care were more positive in fathers and babies who performed the KC intervention.

        <ab>This prospective study conducted at a single center in 2022 aims to identify risk and protective factors for postpartum depression (PPD) in Polish women and to assess the impact of pregnancy, delivery, the postpartum period, and psychosocial factors on PPD. After delivery and 4 weeks later, 311 women filled out two questionnaires of our design related to risk factors for PPD. Immune Power Personality Questionnaire, Walsh Family Resilience Questionnaire, and Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale were also applied. The predictors of PPD identified at two time points included: use of antidepressants, previous depressive episodes, family history of depression, risk of preterm delivery, anxiety about child’s health, and breastfeeding and sleep problems. Risk factors for PPD found only after delivery were: suicidal ideation before pregnancy, stressful life events, premature rupture of the membranes, and cesarean section. Inhalation analgesia during labor reduced the PPD frequency. At 4 weeks’ postpartum, regular physical activity was also predictive of PPD, while breastfeeding, financial satisfaction, and sufficient sleep duration were protective factors. PPD after delivery was negatively correlated with capacity to confide, hardiness, assertiveness, self-complexity, and communication. PPD at 4 weeks postpartum decreased belief systems, organization patterns, and communication. Two proposed self-designed questionnaires can be useful for effectively screening PPD in the Polish population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised is a short but valid and reliable robust measure of different aspects of birth satisfaction. This study aimed to test factor structure, validity and reliability of the Croatian version of the Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised. In the cross-sectional study, a convenient online sample of 552 women completed questionnaires in the first year postpartum. The Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised, subscale Satisfaction with Delivery from the Childbirth Perception Questionnaire, and a set of questions on demographic and obstetric data were administered. The results showed the excellent fit of both the three-factor model (Stress experienced during labour, Women's personal attributes, Quality of care) and two-factor model (with Stress and Women's attributes combined into one factor), with no significant difference between the two models. Furthermore, bi-factor modeling revealed a general factor of childbirth experience, which explains the variance of items from Stress and Women's attributes subscales. The internal consistency was high for the total scale and Quality of care, while acceptable for the other two subscales. Convergent and divergent validity was high. Known-group discriminant validity showed that women who gave birth by unassisted vaginal birth and planned caesarean section reported higher levels of birth satisfaction. In conclusion, both empirical findings and theoretical background suggest a three-factor model as the better solution for the Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised conceptualization. As the Croatian version of the Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised was shown to be valid and reliable, it is recommended for use to measure birth satisfaction both for research and practical purposes.

        <ab>Introduction: Cesarean section and induced deliveries have increased substantially in the U.S., coinciding with increases in autism spectrum disorder. Studies have documented associations between cesarean section deliveries and autism spectrum disorder but have not comprehensively accounted for medical risks. This study evaluates the extent to which cesarean section and induced deliveries are associated with autism spectrum disorder in low-risk births. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, California's birth records (1992–2012) were linked to hospital discharge records to identify low-risk births using a stringent algorithm based on Joint Commission guidelines. Autism spectrum disorder status was based on California Department of Developmental Service data. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between autism spectrum disorder and induced vaginal deliveries, cesarean section deliveries not following induction, and cesarean section deliveries following induction, with noninduced vaginal deliveries as the reference category. Results: A total of 1,488,425 low-risk births took place in California from 1992 to 2012. The adjusted odds of autism spectrum disorder were 7% higher for induced vaginal deliveries (AOR=1.07, 95% CI=1.01, 1.14), 26% higher for cesarean section deliveries not following induction (AOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.19, 1.33), and 31% higher for cesarean section deliveries following induction (AOR=1.31, 95% CI=1.18, 1.45) than for noninduced vaginal deliveries. Lower gestational age and neonatal morbidities did not appear to be important underlying pathways. The associations were insensitive to alternative model specifications and across subpopulations. These results suggest that, in low-risk pregnancies, up to 10% of autism spectrum disorder cases are potentially preventable by avoiding cesarean section deliveries. Conclusions: After accounting for medical risks, elective deliveries—particularly cesarean section deliveries—were associated with a substantially increased risk of autism spectrum disorder.

        <ab>Aim: Little is known about whether pain can be effectively managed in pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD) during delivery hospitalization, particularly those undergoing surgery and taking buprenorphine as medication for OUD (MOUD). To address this question, we compared pain scores and opioid analgesic utilization during delivery hospitalization in women taking their pre-hospital dose of buprenorphine who delivered by cesarean section to matched controls. To inform future research efforts, we also began to explore opioid analgesic utilization and pain scores by type of anesthesia as this variable is often not included in related literature. Methods: Retrospective matched cohort study of 46 women prescribed buprenorphine during pregnancy who delivered by cesarean section during a 7-year period. Results: When compared to matched controls, women taking their pre-hospital dose of buprenorphine undergoing cesarean section utilized more opioid analgesics as measured by morphine milligram equivalents (MME) (mean MME first 48 hours 153.0 mg vs 175.1 mg, respectively, P &lt; .01) but had similar pain scores during delivery hospitalization. There was no difference in MME utilization by maternal dose of buprenorphine though sample sizes were small. Women on buprenorphine who received spinal anesthesia with morphine had mean pain scores that were 1.4 points lower (P = .01) during the first 48 hours than women on buprenorphine receiving other methods of anesthesia. Discussion And Conclusions: Pregnant women taking their pre-hospital dose of buprenorphine throughout their surgical delivery hospitalization were able to achieve pain relief similar to women not on MOUD but had higher MME requirements. Our results add to the emerging body of evidence suggesting that individuals on MOUD can achieve adequate post-surgical pain management without adjusting their pre-hospital dose of buprenorphine. Further research is required to fully understand the optimal buprenorphine dosing regimen during surgical hospitalizations. Our results also provide important preliminary evidence that spinal anesthesia containing opioids can be used effectively in individuals with OUD requiring surgical intervention.

        <ab>Objective: Women have an increased risk for mental distress and depressive symptoms in relation to pregnancy and birth. The serotonin transporter (SERT) may be involved in the emergence of depressive symptoms postpartum and during other sex-hormone transitions. It may be associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the main serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA). In 100 healthy pregnant women, who were scheduled to deliver by cesarean section (C-section), we evaluated 5-HIAA and estradiol contributions to mental distress 5 weeks postpartum. Methods: Eighty-two women completed the study. CSF collected at C-section was analyzed for 5-HIAA, with high performance liquid chromatography. Serum estradiol concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before C-section and postpartum. Postpartum mental distress was evaluated with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Associations between EPDS, 5-HIAA, and Δestradiol were evaluated in linear regression models adjusted for age, parity and SERT genotype. Results: Higher levels of postpartum mental distress symptoms were negatively associated with a large decrease in estradiol concentrations (βΔE2 = 0.73, p = 0.007) and, on a trend level, positively associated with high antepartum 5-HIAA levels (β5-HIAA = 0.002, p = 0.06). Conclusion: In a cohort of healthy pregnant women, postpartum mental distress was higher in women with high antepartum 5-HIAA (trend) and lower in women with a large perinatal estradiol decrease. We speculate that high antepartum 5-HIAA is a proxy of SERT levels, that carry over to the postpartum period and convey susceptibility to mental distress. In healthy women, the postpartum return to lower estradiol concentrations may promote mental wellbeing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Sustainable Development Goal Three has prioritised reducing maternal, under-5 and neonatal mortalities as core global health policy objectives. The place, where expectant mothers choose to deliver their babies has a direct effect on maternal health outcomes. In sub-Saharan Africa, existing literature has shown that some women attend antenatal care during pregnancy but choose to deliver their babies at home. Using the Andersen and Newman Behavioural Model, this study explored the institutional and socio-cultural factors motivating women to deliver at home after attending antenatal care. Methods: A qualitative, exploratory, cross-sectional design was deployed. Data were collected from a purposive sample of 23 women, who attended antenatal care during pregnancy but delivered their babies at home, 10 health workers and 17 other community-level stakeholders. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Results: In line with the Andersen and Newman Model, the study discovered that traditional and religious belief systems about marital fidelity and the role of the gods in childbirth, myths about consequences of facility-based delivery, illiteracy, and weak women’s autonomy in healthcare decision-making, predisposed women to home delivery. Home delivery was also enabled by inadequate midwives at health facilities, the unfriendly attitude of health workers, hidden charges for facility-based delivery, and long distances to healthcare facilities. The fear of caesarean section, also created the need for women who attended antenatal care to deliver at home. Conclusion: The study has established that socio-cultural and institutional level factors influenced women’s decisions to deliver at home. We recommend a general improvement in the service delivery capacity of health facilities, and the implementation of collaborative educational and women empowerment programmes by stakeholders, to strengthen women’s autonomy and reshape existing traditional and religious beliefs facilitating home delivery.

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To explore the impact of delivery mode on women’s postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background: Childbirth significantly affects puerpera’s physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design: Cross-sectional study design. Methods: Women residing in rural areas and in their 0–12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women’s socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results: The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions: Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice: Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Studies have shown women with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) have elevated risks of perinatal complications, but few studies have examined how social, health, and disability-related factors affect these risks. OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe subgroups of pregnant women with IDD according to social, health, and disability-related factors and examine the risks of perinatal complications in these subgroups compared to women without IDD. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, of women with (n = 1922) and without (n = 1,126,854) IDD, with a singleton birth in 2003–2018. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subgroups of women according to social (e.g., age), health (e.g., chronic medical conditions), and disability-related (e.g., IDD type) characteristics. Modified Poisson regression was then used to compare the risks of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, and preterm birth across identified subgroups to women without IDD. RESULTS: The LCA identified 4 classes of women with IDD: (1) young women who were mostly healthy and had little primary care before pregnancy (n = 253); (2) older women who were mostly healthy (n = 795); (3) young to mid-aged women who had significant comorbidities (n = 181); and (4) young women, many of whom were autistic, who had some medical comorbidities and significant psychiatric comorbidities (n = 693). Class 3 consistently had the greatest risks of perinatal complications, across all IDD groups, compared to women without IDD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of multidisciplinary care approaches tailored to the needs of at-risk women with IDD, in the preconception and perinatal periods.

        <ab>Objective: Cesarean section (CS) rates are rising rapidly around the world but no conclusive evidence has been obtained about the possible short- and long-term effects of CS on child behavior. We evaluated prospectively the association between CS and infant temperament across the first 9 postpartum months, controlling for indications for CS and investigating parity and infant sex as moderators. Methods: The sample consisted of mothers and their healthy infants. Infant temperament was measured using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire completed by the mothers at 6 weeks (n = 452) and 9 months (n = 258) postpartum. Mode of birth was classified into spontaneous vaginal birth (n = 347 for 6 weeks sample; 197 for 9 months sample), CS planned for medical reasons (n = 55; 28) and emergency CS (n = 50; 33). Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed no main effects of birth mode, but showed a significant interaction between birth mode and parity indicating that emergency CS in firstborn infants was associated with more difficult temperament at 6 weeks. There were no significant associations between indications for CS and infant temperament, although breech presentation predicted difficult temperament at 9 months. Conclusion: We largely failed to support the association between CS and infant temperament. Although our results suggest that emergency CS may be associated with temperament in firstborns, further research is needed to replicate this finding, preferably using observational measures to assess child temperament.

        <ab>Antepartum depression, general anxiety symptoms, and pregnancy-related anxiety have been recognized to affect pregnancy outcomes. Systematic reviews on these associations lack consistent findings, which is why further research is required. We examined the associations between psychological distress, mode of birth, epidural analgesia, and duration of labor. Data from 3619 women with singleton pregnancies, from the population-based FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were analyzed. Maternal psychological distress was measured during pregnancy at 24 and 34 weeks, using the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised 2 (PRAQ-R2) and its subscale 'Fear of Giving Birth' (FOC), the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Mode of birth, epidural analgesia, and labor duration were obtained from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Maternal psychological distress, when captured with PRAQ-R2, FOC, and SCL-90, increased the likelihood of women having an elective cesarean section (OR: 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.06, p = .003; OR: 1.13, 95% CI 1.07–1.20, p &lt; .001; OR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10, p = .001), but no association was detected for instrumental delivery or emergency cesarean section. A rise in both the PRAQ-R2, and FOC measurements increased the likelihood of an epidural analgesia (OR: 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.03, p = .003; OR: 1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.12, p &lt; .001) and predicted longer second stage of labor (OR: 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.01, p = .023; OR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.05, p &lt; .001). EPDS did not predict any of the analyzed outcomes. The results indicate that maternal anxiety symptoms (measured using PRAQ-R2, FOC, and SCL-90) are associated with elective cesarean section. Psychological distress increases the use of epidural analgesia, but is not associated with complicated vaginal birth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT This study reports the spectrum of discharge diagnoses in a national cohort of newborns admitted during a 3-month period to hospitals across Jamaica. The data were analyzed using measures of central tendency and risk assessed using odds ratio. Data on 1607 admissions were used to describe the spectrum of morbidity in hospitalized infants. Eight hundred and seven (50%) male and 754 (48%) female neonates were admitted. There was a 15% (240) readmission rate during the neonatal period. Infants of diabetic mothers were almost three times as likely to be admitted as infants whose mothers were not diabetic OR 2.89 (CI 1.96 − 4.13). Infants of women who were hypertensive were 1.5 times more likely to be admitted than infants of non-hypertensive women OR 1.56 (CI 1.56–1.9). The odds ratio for admission of an infant born to a woman delivered by caesarean section was 2.1 (CI: 1.67–2.38). Premature infants constituted 50% of admissions. The most prevalent discharge diagnosis included presumed sepsis, respiratory distress and neonatal jaundice in both preterm and term neonates. In the extreme preterm infant respiratory distress syndrome was the most predominant discharge diagnosis. Multiple gestation was a significant risk for admission OR 2.7 (CI 1.8 to 3.9). Prematurity, multiple gestation, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, maternal hypertension and low 5 minute Apgar score &lt; 7 were all found to be independent predictors of neonatal admission in a logistic regression model (p &lt; 0.001). The recognition of the discharge morbidity is useful for future health planning for the most vulnerable in our population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT This study aimed to determine the mortality in a Jamaican birth cohort over a 3-month period. Data on the outcome of 87.5% of all births in Jamaica between July and September 2011 were used to determine trends in and determinants of neonatal mortality. There were 9650 live births and 144 neonatal deaths yielding a Neonatal Mortality Rate of 14.9/1000 (95% CI: 12.6–17.52/1000) livebirths. One hundred and twenty-one (84%) deaths occurred within the first seven days of life giving an Early Neonatal Mortality Rate of 12.5/1000 (95%CI: 10.4–15.0/1000) livebirths and a Late Neonatal Mortality Rate of 2.38/1000 (95%CI: 1.51–3.57/1000) live births. Sixty-nine (48%) deaths occurred within the first 24 hours. Thirty-eight neonates (26%) died prior to being admitted to a neonatal unit, approximately within 2 hours of life. Maternal age &lt;15 years, decreasing birthweight, prematurity, male gender, multiple gestation and birth by caesarean section were associated with an increased risk of mortality p &lt; 0.05. In order for Jamaica to experience further decline in its Neonatal Mortality Rate to meet the Sustainable Developmental Goal of at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births by 2030 the focus must be on decreasing mortality in the very low birth weight infants who disproportionally contribute to mortality as well as continuing to implement measures to further decrease mortality in the larger infants.

        <ab>Rationale: Pregnant women are especially vulnerable to mental health problems, including stress, anxiety, and depression. This risk has been increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and differences in psychological symptoms in pregnancy and postpartum before and during COVID-19 exists. Mental health problems can have adverse effects on both the woman, and the neonate, including miscarriages, premature births, low birth weight, and higher rates of cesarean sections and instrument-assisted deliveries. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of psychological symptoms of pregnant women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the psychological profile in a sample of pregnant women selected before the pandemic and a sample of women studied during the first wave of the pandemic. A total of 122 women were selected prior to the pandemic and 181 women during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R) was used to assess depression and anxiety during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Results: The prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy were higher in the sample of women studied during the pandemic (SCL-90-R: M = 54.6 vs. 42.6 and M = 62.6 vs. 51.7 respectively). In the postpartum the difference between both samples of women was even higher for depression and anxiety (SCL-90-R: M = 50.4 vs. 35.0 and M = 51.3 vs. 36.0 respectively). Being a pregnant woman at the COVID-19 outbreak was directly associated with a higher score of depression symptoms (aOR = 8.67, 95% CI [3.26, 23.02], p &lt; .001). Anxiety during childbirth was more frequently reported by women before the pandemic (aOR = 5.13, 95% CI [2.53, 10.44], p &lt; .001). The variable stage (before/during pandemic) was also associated with having a clinical SCL-90-R score above 70 (aOR = 7.61, 95% CI [2.7, 21.47], p &lt; .001). Conclusion: During the pandemic, pregnancy and postpartum were associated with the presence of anxiety and depression. The main factor associated with postpartum depression was maternal age. These finding highlights the vulnerability of pregnant in front of the pandemic, in which psychological health and mental well-being are affected, not only during pregnancy, but also in the postpartum.

        <ab>Justificación: Las mujeres embarazadas son especialmente vulnerables a los problemas de salud mental, como el estrés, la ansiedad y la depresión. Este riesgo se ha incrementado durante la pandemia de COVID-19, habiendo diferencias en los síntomas psicológicos en el embarazo y el puerperio antes y después de la pandemia. Los problemas de salud mental pueden tener efectos perjudiciales tanto en la mujer como en el recién nacido, como abortos espontáneos, partos prematuros, bajo peso al nacer y tasas más altas de cesáreas y partos asistidos. Objetivo: Evaluar la prevalencia de síntomas psicológicos de gestantes antes y durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Método: Se realizó un estudio transversal para evaluar el perfil psicológico en una muestra de mujeres embarazadas seleccionadas antes de la pandemia y una muestra de mujeres estudiadas durante la primera ola de la pandemia. Se seleccionó un total de 122 mujeres antes de la pandemia y 181 mujeres durante el brote de COVID-19. Se utilizó la Inventario de Verificación de Síntomas-90 Revisada (SCL-90-R) para evaluar la depresión y la ansiedad durante el embarazo y el puerperio. Resultados: La prevalencia de síntomas de depresión y ansiedad durante el embarazo fue mayor en la muestra de mujeres estudiadas durante la pandemia (SCL-90-R: M = 54.6 vs. 42.6 y M = 62.6 vs. 51.7 respectivamente). En el postparto la diferencia entre ambas muestras de mujeres fue aún mayor para depresión y ansiedad (SCL-90-R: M = 50.4 vs. 35.0 y M = 51.3 vs. 36.0 respectivamente). Ser mujer embarazada en el brote de COVID-19 se asoció directamente con una mayor puntuación de síntomas de depresión (aOR = 8.67, IC 95% [3.26, 23.02, p &lt; .001). Las mujeres manifestaron ansiedad durante el parto con mayor frecuencia antes de la pandemia (aOR = 5.13, IC 95% 2.53, 10.44], p &lt; .001). La variable estadio (antes/durante la pandemia) también se asoció con tener una puntuación clínica SCL- 90-R superior a 70 (aOR = 7.61, IC 95% [2.7, 21.47], p &lt; .001). Conclusión: Durante la pandemia, el embarazo y el postparto se asociaron con la presencia de ansiedad y depresión. El principal factor asociado a la depresión posparto fue la edad materna. Estos hallazgos resaltan la vulnerabilidad de las mujeres embarazadas ante la pandemia, en la que la salud psicológica y el bienestar mental se ven afectados, no solo durante el embarazo, sino también en el posparto.

        <ab>This study analyses, in children born in twin births, the relationship between reading, writing and arithmetic learning, on the one hand, and type of delivery, on the other, controlling for the effect of interaction and/or confusion of third variables (maternal age at delivery, gestational age, fetal position, birthweight, 1‐min Apgar score). In the planned retrospective cohort design, the exposed cohort consisted of children born by caesarean section, and the non‐exposed cohort was comprised of children born vaginally. One hundred and twenty‐four children born of twin births were evaluated during their first year of primary school: K‐BIT tests were used to measure intelligence; the Evalúa‐1 battery was used to assess reading, writing, and arithmetic ability; and the children's clinical histories were analysed for obstetric and neonatal variables. After applying binary logistic regressions for each dependent variable, it was found that caesarean delivery in twin births appeared as a possible independent risk factor for specific learning disabilities (LDs) in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Based on these results, further research using larger samples and at more advanced ages is required in order to analyse the influence of obstetric and neonatal variables on the processes underlying specific LDs.

        <ab>Objective: To determine the history of resumption of intercourse after childbirth and associated contraceptive practices among women in the southwest region of Nigeria. Methods: A cohort of 181 women with live births was followed up for 6 months after delivery. Enquiry about the time of first intercourse after childbirth, associated dyspareunia, use of contraception, etc was made during the postnatal clinic visits and/or by telephone contact. Results: Fifty (27.6%) had coitus within six weeks of childbirth, it increased to 115 (63.3%) at three months and 127 (70.2%) by six months post-delivery. Prevalence of dyspareunia was 36.2%. Eighty three (65.4%) of sexually active women practiced contraception which was predominantly use of male condom and withdrawal method. Co-habitation with husband (adjusted OR: 6.30; 95% CI: 2.56–17.01; p = 0.001) and mode of delivery (adjusted OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.30–4.73; p = 0.006) were strong predictors of commencement of sexual intercourse within six months postpartum. Significantly fewer women who had Caesarean section resumed coitus within six months when compared with those who had vaginal deliveries (59.2% versus 78.4%). Perineal injury did not predict resumption of coitus or experience of dyspareunia. Conclusion: In contrast to the norm, more women in southwest Nigeria are resuming coitus soon after childbirth.

        <ab>Objectives: Despite the well-documented negative effects of posttraumatic stress symptoms following childbirth (PTSS-FC), research on protective factors for PTSS-FC is still missing. Aiming to fill this gap, we proposed and examined a process model through which maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact after birth reduces PTSS-FC by decreasing negative emotions, especially for women who had operative births. Method: In this longitudinal study, pregnant women (N = 1833) were recruited at community and hospital medical centres in the center of Israel and through internet forums. At Time 1, during pregnancy, they rated their prenatal depressive symptoms which served as an indicator for prenatal vulnerabilities. At Time 2, two-months postpartum (N = 1371, 75% of the sample), they reported their mode of birth, whether they had skin-to-skin contact with their newborn after birth, their emotions during birth, and rated their current PTSS-FC. A moderated mediation analysis was used to examine the proposed model. Results: Guilt and fear during birth mediated the association between mode of birth (instrumental or cesarean versus vaginal) and PTSS-FC. Skin-to-skin contact was related to reduced feelings of guilt and fear during birth, especially for women who had a cesarean section. Conclusions: Our results recognize the specific emotions that contribute to the development of PTSS-FC following operative births and show how skin-to-skin contact can possibly reduce them. As such they emphasize the importance of the implementation of skin-to-skin contact following childbirth, and especially following a cesarean section as recommended by the Baby Friendly Health Initiative (World Health Organization &amp; UNICEF, 2009).

        <ab>The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to examine the association between Cesarean section (CS) and child development and behavior. The sample consisted of 256 children who were born at term without serious perinatal pathologies. Their development and behavior was assessed at the age of four using Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3), Children’s Behavior Questionnaire and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between CS and child outcomes. CS was associated with better scores in the Problem Solving domain of the ASQ in the whole sample. After stratifying by child sex, the positive association between CS and the Problem Solving domain was significant in boys, while no association was found in girls. Girls were rated less optimally in the Gross Motor domain of the ASQ when born via CS. Mode of birth was not associated with behavioral outcomes.

        <ab>Comments on the articles, Planned vaginal birth or elective repeat caesarean: Patient preference restricted cohort with nested randomised trial by C. A. Crowther et al. and Maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with a trial of labor after prior cesarean delivery by M. B. Landon et al. (2004). The Landon et al and the Crowther et al papers are both prospective trials comparing planned vaginal birth after a previous cesarean section (VBAC) with elective cesarean section in women eligible for a trial of labor. With 33,000 women, the cohort studied by Landon et al in conjunction with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) spawned multiple publications, giving estimates of VBAC risks and success relevant to women in a wide variety of clinical situations. Data abstraction was careful and outcomes were hard and verified. With 2,300 women, the study by Crowther et al, was 6 percent the size of the Landon‐NICHHD study. Although it claimed 'increased risk of both fetal death or liveborn infant death prior to discharge or serious infant outcome,' there were only 2 perinatal deaths—both stillbirths prior to 39 weeks' gestation and unrelated to mode of delivery. Of the 28 infants with 'serious neonatal morbidity,' only three could have resulted from uterine rupture; prior experience with this outcome indicates all three will likely escape long‐term morbidity. Pseudorandomization and erroneous adherence to an intention‐to‐treat principle seriously hinder the study's internal validity, attributing outcomes for one quarter of women undergoing elective cesarean section to the planned VBAC group. The study by Landon and NICHHD is over 10 times larger and of much higher quality than the study by Crowther et al. The Landon‐NICHHD publications should be used to help women make decisions about planned mode of delivery after cesarean. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Antenatal depression is a prevalent mental disorder in women who have undergone caesarean section, and it often presages adverse postoperative outcomes. Because of the lack of a laboratory-based diagnostic strategy, antenatal depression is mainly determined by a psychologist’s subjective judgment based on a structured clinical interview for established diagnostic criteria. However, the diagnostic accuracy rate for depression by non-psychiatrists is relatively low. Thus, this study aimed to use lipidomics to identify potential biomarkers related to antenatal depression in women who have undergone caesarean section. Methods: The study was designed as a matched prospective observational study. Singleton pregnant women scheduled to receive elective caesarean section, were screened for eligibility. Women diagnosed with major antenatal depression were matched with non-antenatal depression controls in terms of age (±1 year) and BMI (± 1 kg/m²), and blood samples of the included matched pairs were collected. Subsequently, lipidomics of the plasma samples were performed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to explore the differentially expressed lipids in women with or without antenatal depression. Results: In total, 484 pregnant women were screened; 66 subjects were recruited, including 33 subjects with major antenatal depression and 33 matched controls without antenatal depression. Thirty-five differentially expressed lipid metabolites were identified (P &lt; 0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of these lipid metabolites was 0.7 or larger; the area under curve for cholesterol sulfate was 0.823 (95% CI: 0.716–0.930), and that of PC (18:2 (2E, 4E)/0:0) was 0.778 (95%CI: 0.662–0.895). In the conditional logistic stepwise regression analysis, cholesterol sulfate (P = 0.009) and PC (18:2 (2E, 4E)/0:0) (P = 0.035) were also identified as effective predictive risk factors for antenatal depression. Conclusions: Women who had undergone caesarean section and experienced antenatal depression presented a significantly differentially expressed profile of plasma lipidomics compared to those who did not experience antenatal depression. Cholesterol sulfate and PC (18:2 (2E, 4E)/0:0) may be effective and specific lipidic biomarkers for the prediction of antenatal depression.

        <ab>Objectives: Among childbearing women, insurance coverage determines degree of access to preventive and emergency care for maternal and infant health. Maternal-infant dyads with dual burden of severe maternal morbidity and preterm birth experience high physical and psychological morbidity, and the risk of dual burden varies by insurance type. We examined whether sociodemographic and perinatal risk factors of dual burden differed by insurance type. Methods: We estimated relative risks of dual burden by maternal sociodemographic and perinatal characteristics in the 2007–2012 California birth cohort dataset stratified by insurance type and compared effects across insurance types using Wald Z-statistics. Results: Dual burden ranged from 0.36% of privately insured births to 0.41% of uninsured births. Obstetric comorbidities, multiple gestation, parity, and birth mode conferred the largest risks across all insurance types, but effect magnitude differed. The adjusted relative risk of dual burden associated with preeclampsia superimposed on preexisting hypertension ranged from 9.1 (95% CI 7.6–10.9) for privately insured to 15.9 (95% CI 9.1–27.6) among uninsured. The adjusted relative risk of dual burden associated with cesarean birth ranged from 3.1 (95% CI 2.7–3.5) for women with Medi-Cal to 5.4 (95% CI 3.5–8.2) for women with other insurance among primiparas, and 7.0 (95% CI 6.0–8.3) to 19.4 (95% CI 10.3–36.3), respectively, among multiparas. Conclusions: Risk factors of dual burden differed by insurance type across sociodemographic and perinatal factors, suggesting that care quality may differ by insurance type. Attention to peripartum care access and care quality provided by insurance type is needed to improve maternal and neonatal health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Maternal psychological factors like depression, anxiety and stress have been associated with infant fussiness or colic. However, little research exists on whether positive factors such as social support and the happiness of the mother–partner relationship are associated with lower rates of infant fussiness or colic. Objectives: We investigated the association between infant colic and three types of maternal support: general maternal social support (during pregnancy and post partum), the happiness of the mother–partner relationship (during pregnancy and post partum) and partner involvement in caring for the newborn. Methods: Participants were 3006 women in the First Baby Study, a prospective study of the effect of mode of first delivery on subsequent childbearing. Women were interviewed by telephone during pregnancy and 1 month after first childbirth and asked about social support and if their baby had a variety of problems since birth, including ‘Colic – crying or fussiness three or more hours a day’. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to model the association between maternal support and infant colic, controlling for confounders, including maternal race or ethnicity, insurance, marital status, smoking, mode of delivery, maternal post‐partum depression, breastfeeding, other neonatal illnesses and newborn gestational age. Results: Infant colic was reported by 11.6% of new mothers. High general maternal social support (in comparison with low), measured during pregnancy, was associated with lower reported infant colic (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40–0.75) and measured post partum (AOR, 0.51, 95% CI, 0.39–0.67); high relationship happiness (in comparison with low), measured during pregnancy (AOR, 0.71, 95% CI, 0.54–0.93), and measured post partum (AOR, 0.22, 95% CI, 0.12–0.40); and high partner involvement with newborn care (in comparison with low) (AOR, 0.60, 95% CI, 0.44–0.81). Conclusion: Higher levels of maternal social support during pregnancy and post partum are associated with lower rates of maternal reported infant colic.

        <ab>This study aimed to develop and validate a labor induction nomogram for nulliparous and multiparous women who were 38 weeks pregnant or more and had their labor induced by an unfavorable cervix. This prospective study was conducted on 300 individuals (200 for nomogram development and 100 for nomogram validation). Height, body mass index at delivery, parity, gestational age, adjusted bishop score, and cesarean section risk assessment were all recorded on a checklist. Participants were followed until they gave birth, and the type of delivery was noted in the checklist. Out of 300 labor inductions, 80 (26.7%) underwent a cesarean section. Cesarean risk estimation was the only predictor of delivery type based on multivariate logistic regression. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) in development group was 0.68 and in validation group was 0.71. The developed nomogram for predicting of cesarean section risk following labor induction has a relatively good predictive value among women.

        <ab>Background: The birth of a preterm infant can be stressful and traumatic for parents and may cause posttraumatic stress symptoms and disorders. There is a dearth of data from controlled studies regarding level, prevalence, risk, and predictors of these symptoms in parents after preterm birth. Methods: As part of the longitudinal HaFEn-study, data from parents of infants with very low birth weight (VLBW), and term infants were cross-sectionally analyzed. We recruited parents at the three largest perinatal care centers in Hamburg, Germany. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed with a standardized questionnaire, and acute and posttraumatic stress disorders with a clinical interview one month postpartum. Stress during birth, lifetime psychiatric diagnoses, social support, pregnancy risks, and mode of delivery were also evaluated. To examine predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms in both parents simultaneously, we constructed multiple random coefficient models. Results: 230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. The risk for acute stress disorder was increased in mothers with VLBW infants but not in fathers. While the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder was not elevated, the level of posttraumatic stress symptoms was higher in both parents with VLBW infants. Predictors for posttraumatic stress symptoms were stress during birth, low social support, psychiatric lifetime diagnoses, the birth of a VLBW infant, and female parent sex. Limitations: Results reported here are cross-sectional. Thus, no temporal relationships can be established. Conclusions: Although posttraumatic stress disorders were rare, our results suggest that posttraumatic stress symptoms and acute stress disorders are common in parents of VLBW infants.

        <ab>Purpose: Global rates of caesarean section (CS) rates have increased rapidly in recent years. This is a growing public health concern as it has been proposed that CS may impact cognitive outcomes in childhood. However, the evidence for this association is limited and inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between obstetric mode of delivery and longitudinal cognitive outcomes in childhood. Methods: We examined this question using data from a longitudinal cohort study of 8845 participants from the Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative UK cohort, who completed a range of verbal and visual-spatial cognitive assessments at ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 years. Results: We found a statistically significant association between planned CS and visual-spatial cognitive delay in the pattern construction assessment at age 5 (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99–1.72) and age 7 (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.12–1.81). Additionally planned CS was also associated with increased odds of 'early childhood delay' (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.15–2.50) and borderline increased odds of 'persistent delay' (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.99–1.89) in visual-spatial cognitive tests. Mode of delivery was not associated with verbal ability or with patterns of delay at any age point in verbal cognitive tests. Conclusion: We have reported a small association between planned CS and visual-spatial cognitive delay in childhood. However, while this result should be interpreted with caution, it highlights the need to further explore this potential relationship and the causal basis of such an association.

        <ab>Background: Knowledge of the associations between obesity and cesarean delivery (CD) is limited by previous research that does not separate the highest BMI classes. Methods: We identified 25,604 pregnancies in retrospective electronic medical records at an inner-city academic hospital between 2000 and 2015. We examined the association between BMI at pre-pregnancy and delivery, as well as gestational weight gain (GWG), and rates of CD, gestational diabetes mellitus (GD), and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) using logistic regression and chi-square. Results: CD increased with each increase in delivery BMI class [X² (7, N = 25,604) =151.40, p &lt; .0001]. GD and PIH also significantly increased across each BMI class. Each increasing BMI class predicted 1.21 times greater odds of CD even after adjusting for maternal age, year of birth, GD, and PIH [OR = 1.21 (95% CI, 1.07–1.37)]. As compared with the IOM recommended GWG, less weight gain offered mitigation of CD and GD, though less than the recommended GWG for women who were obese pre-pregnancy also increased odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth. Conclusions: Increasing BMI is associated with increasing rates of adverse obstetric outcomes. There exists a 'dose-dependent' effect of BMI on CD and limiting GWG may be associated with mitigated risk for this outcome, but increased risk for offspring adverse birth outcomes.

        <ab>Gene–environment–development interactions are suggested to play a crucial role in psychiatric disorders. However, it is not clear if there are specific risk gene interactions with particular pre-, peri-, and postnatal risk factors for distinct disorders, such as adult attention-deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (aADHD) and bipolar disorder (BD). In this pilot study, the first aim was to investigate retrospective self-reports of pre-, peri-, and postnatal complications and risk factors from 126 participants (aADHD, BD, and healthy controls) and their mothers. The second aim was to investigate possible interaction between the previously published common risk gene variants of ADHD in the ADGRL3 (= LPHN3) gene (rs2305339, rs1397548, rs734644, rs1397547, rs2271338, rs6551665, and rs2345039) and shared risk gene variants of aADHD and BD in the DGKH gene (DGKH rs994856/rs9525580/rs9525584 GAT haplotype) and pre-, peri-, and postnatal risk factors in comparison to a healthy control group. After correction for multiple comparison, the following pre-, peri-, and postnatal risk factors remained statistically significant (p ≤ 0.0036) between healthy controls and ADHD and BD patients as one group: unplanned pregnancies, psychosocial stress of the mother during pregnancy, mode of delivery, shared decision-making regarding medical procedures during the delivery, perinatal bonding, number of crybabies, and quality of mother–child and father–child relationship. There were no significant environment–gene interactions. In our preliminary data, similar risk factors were found to be significantly associated with both disorders in comparison to healthy controls. However, larger and longitudinal studies and standardized and validated instruments to get a better understanding of the interaction of pre-, peri-, and postnatal complications and mental health in the offspring are needed.

        <ab>Aim: To describe the incidence of term and preterm neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) and identify perinatal risk factors. Method: This was a national capture‐recapture calculation‐corrected surveillance and nested case–control study. Infants born preterm and at term with magnetic resonance imaging‐confirmed neonatal CSVT were identified by surveillance in all paediatric hospitals in Germany (2015–2017). Incidence was corrected for underreporting using a capture‐recapture method in one federal state and then extrapolated nationwide. We reviewed PubMed for comparisons with previously reported incidence estimators. We used a population‐based perinatal database for quality assurance to select four controls per case and applied univariate and multivariable regression for risk factor analysis. Results: Fifty‐one newborn infants (34 males, 17 females; 14 born preterm) with neonatal CSVT were reported in the 3‐year period. The incidence of term and preterm neonatal CSVT was 6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4–8.7) per 100 000 live births. Median age at time of confirmation of the diagnosis was 9.95 days (range 0–39d). In the univariate analysis, male sex, preterm birth, hypoxia and related indicators (umbilical artery pH &lt;7.1; 5‐minute Apgar score &lt;7; intubation/mask ventilation; perinatal asphyxia), operative vaginal delivery, emergency Caesarean section, and pathological fetal Doppler sonography were associated (p &lt; 0.05) with neonatal CSVT. Multivariable regression yielded hypoxia (odds ratio = 20.3; 95% CI 8.1–50.8) as the independent risk factor. Interpretation: Incidence of neonatal CSVT was within the range of other population‐based studies. The results suggest that hypoxia is an important perinatal risk factor for the aetiology of neonatal CSVT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected the health-care system worldwide. The effect of COVID-19 on obstetric and perinatal outcomes is yet to be completely ascertained. A hospital-based prospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, AIIMS Rishikesh from July to December 2020. A total of 60 COVID-positive pregnant women were included. Obstetric and perinatal outcomes were compared with 60 COVID-negative pregnant women. A subgroup comparison was also performed between symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with COVID-19. Majority of COVID-positive pregnant women were asymptomatic (81.7%). Eleven patients were symptomatic, out of which 9 (15%) had mild disease and only 2 (3.3%) had severe pneumonia. There was an increased likelihood of early pregnancy loss (5%), oligohydramnios (21.7%), preterm birth (31.7%), and cesarean section (53.3%). The occurrence of preterm birth was significantly higher in symptomatic women than asymptomatic women (p = .01). Oligohydramnios was significantly more frequent in COVID-positive than COVID-negative pregnant women (p = .048). Preterm birth and cesarean rate were slightly higher in COVID-positive group but the difference was not statistically significant. Other obstetric outcomes were comparable in both groups. The majority of women with COVID-19 infection in pregnancy remain asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Still, it may lead to maternal death and poor fetal outcomes in form of early pregnancy loss, prematurity, oligohydramnios, intrapartum fetal distress, and increased cesarean rate. Therefore, COVID-19 preventive measures should be strictly implemented and followed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Purpose and setting of research: Caesarean section (C-section) rates of over 15% suggest overuse of the surgery which may be difficult to justify on medical grounds. One important contributor to the rise in Csection rates is the rapid expansion of unregulated private-sector providers in number of settings. This study analyses the contribution of private sector in the rapid rise in Csection deliveries in India and the extent to which these can be justified on medical grounds. Methods: This is a cross sectional study design using National Family Health Surveys. Logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses are performed. The main outcome measured is avoidable C-sections in the private sector. Principal findings: Our findings suggest that the rising trend in C-section rates in the private sector cannot be explained by medical reasons alone. The odds of C-section among women who chose to deliver in private was over 4 times higher than women who chose to delivery in public facilities. Despite, controlling for medical complications, women's characteristics and preferences, our PSM analysis suggest that the public-private gap has doubled over the years and that the difference cannot be explained by known determinants of C-section. Over supply of avoidable C-section to the extent of 21%, as a result of physician induced demand and perverse financial incentives was observed in the private sector. Conclusions: This paper attempts to understand the reason for the high C-section rates in the private sector in India and the extent to which these are avoidable. Our analysis supports the assumption that physician induced demand as a result of perverse financial incentives in the private sector is at play.

        <ab>Objectives: Sensory processing patterns refer to a person’s ability to receive and respond to sensory events which are important to succeed in daily routine activities. This study aims to determine the sensory processing patterns in infants/toddlers. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 518 infants/toddlers participated in this study. Their ages ranged from birth to 36 months. Parents completed the infant/toddler sensory profile for all participants. Results: No significant difference was observed between girls and boys in sensory processing from birth to 6 months; however, there is a significant difference between girls and boys in low registration, sensory sensitivity, and sensory avoidance from 7-36 months. In addition, no significant difference was detected between children born by cesarean and those born through natural childbirth in terms of sensory processing (quadrants and scores) from birth to 6 months and 7-36 months. There is a significant difference between preterm and full-term children (birth to 6 months) in auditory processing. The findings also indicate only a significant difference in oral sensory processing between the preterm and full-term children (7-36 months). Discussion: We discussed sensory processing patterns in children and their differences based on different factors. The results of this study can provide considerations for Iranian occupational therapists and psychologists. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 77(3) of JAMA Psychiatry (see record [rid]2020-21761-015[/rid]). In the original article, surname of the second author was inaccurate. Angelica Lindén Hirschberg should be referred to as Dr Hirschberg, not Dr Lindén Hirschberg. The error has been corrected.] Importance: The prevalence of eating disorders is high among women of reproductive age, yet the association of eating disorders with pregnancy complications and neonatal health has not been investigated in detail, to our knowledge. Objective: To investigate the relative risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes for women with eating disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study included all singleton births included in the Swedish Medical Birth Register from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014. A total of 7542 women with eating disorders were compared with 1 225 321 women without eating disorders. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to April 30, 2019. Via linkage with the national patient register, women with eating disorders were identified and compared with women free of any eating disorder. Eating disorders were further stratified into active or previous disease based on last time of diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (hyperemesis, anemia, preeclampsia, and antepartum hemorrhage), the mode of delivery (cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery, or instrumental vaginal delivery), and the neonatal outcomes (preterm birth, small and large sizes for gestational age, Apgar score &lt;7 at 5 minutes, and microcephaly) were calculated using Poisson regression analysis to estimate risk ratios (RRs). Models were adjusted for age, parity, smoking status, and birth year. Results: There were 2769 women with anorexia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 29.4 [5.3] years), 1378 women with bulimia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [4.9] years), and 3395 women with an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS; mean [SD] age, 28.9 [5.3] years), and they were analyzed and compared with 1 225 321 women without eating disorders (mean [SD] age, 30.3 [5.2] years). All subtypes of maternal eating disorders were associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of hyperemesis during pregnancy (anorexia nervosa: RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.8-2.5]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.6-2.7]; EDNOS: RR, 2.6 [95%CI, 2.3-3.0]). The risk of anemia during pregnancy was doubled for women with active anorexia nervosa (RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.3-3.2]) or EDNOS (RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.5-2.8]). Maternal anorexia nervosa was associated with an increased risk of antepartum hemorrhage (RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.2-2.1]), which was more pronounced in active vs previous disease.Women with anorexia nervosa (RR, 0.7 [95%CI, 0.6-0.9]) and women with EDNOS (RR, 0.8 [95%CI, 0.7-1.0]) were at decreased risk of instrumental-assisted vaginal births; otherwise, there were no major differences in mode of delivery.Women with eating disorders, all subtypes, were at increased risk of a preterm birth (anorexia nervosa: RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.4-1.8]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 1.3 [95%CI, 1.0-1.6]; and EDNOS: RR, 1.4 [95%CI, 1.2-1.6]) and of delivering neonates with microcephaly (anorexia nervosa: RR, 1.9 [95%CI, 1.5-2.4]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.1-2.4]; EDNOS: RR, 1.4 [95%CI, 1.2-1.9]). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that women with active or previous eating disorders, regardless of subtype, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and may need increased surveillance in antenatal and delivery care.

        <ab>Background: Preventive intervention can significantly reduce the human and economic costs of postpartum depression (PPD) compared with treatment post-diagnosis. However, identifying women with a high PPD risk and making a judgement as to the benefits of preventive intervention is a major challenge. Methods: This is a retrospective study of parturients that underwent a cesarean delivery. Control group was used as development cohort and validation cohort to construct the risk prediction model of PPD and determine a risk threshold. Ketamine group and development cohort were used to verify the risk classification of parturients by evaluating whether the incidence of PPD decreased significantly after ketamine treatment in high-risk for PPD population. Results: The AUC for the development cohort and validation cohort of the PPD prediction model were 0.751 (95%CI:0.700-0.802) and 0.748 (95%CI:0.680-0.816), respectively. A threshold of 19% PPD risk probability was determined, with a specificity and sensitivity in the validation cohort are 0.766 and 0.604, respectively. After matching the high-risk group and the low-risk group by propensity score, the results demonstrated that PPD incidence significantly reduced in the high-risk group following ketamine, versus non-ketamine, intervention (p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, intervention in the low-risk group showed no significant difference in PPD outcomes (p &gt; 0.01). Limitation: Randomized trials are needed to further verify the feasibility of the model and the thresholds proposed. Conclusion: This prediction model developed in this study shows utility in predicting PPD risk. Ketamine intervention significantly lowers PPD incidence in parturients with a risk classification threshold greater than 19%. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction Few studies have examined prenatal mood as a means to identify women at risk for negative childbirth experiences. We explore associations between prenatal mood and birth perceptions in a socioeconomically diverse, American sample. Methods We conducted a prospective study of 136 predominantly low‐income and ethnic minority women of mixed parity. Prenatal measures of perceived stress, pregnancy‐related anxiety, and depressive symptoms were used to predict maternal perceptions of birth experiences 1 month postpartum, using the childbirth experience questionnaire (CEQ; 1). Results After adjusting for sociodemographic variables and mode of delivery, higher third‐trimester stress predicted worse CEQ total scores. This association was predominantly explained by two CEQ domains: own capacity (e.g., feelings of control and capability), and perceived safety. Pregnancy‐related anxiety and depressive symptoms correlated with perceived stress, though neither independently predicted birth experience. An unplanned cesarean delivery was associated with a worse CEQ total score. Vaginal delivery predicted greater perceived safety. Altogether, sociodemographic covariates, mode of delivery, and prenatal mood accounted for 35 percent of the variance in birth experience (p &lt; 0.001). Discussion Our finding that prenatal stress explains a significant and likely clinically meaningful proportion of the variance in birth experience suggests that women perceive and recall their birth experiences through a lens that is partially determined by preexisting personal circumstances and emotional reserves. Since childbirth perceptions have implications for maternal and child health, patient satisfaction, and health care expenditures, these findings warrant consideration of prenatal stress screening to target intervention for women at risk for negative birth experiences.

        <ab>Objective: To determine rates of vaginal delivery, emergency caesarean section, and elective caesarean section for first and second births in Australia, and to identify maternal predictors of caesarean section. Methods: Data were from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health. A total of 5275 women aged 18–38 years, who had given birth to their first child between 1996 and 2012 were included; 75.0% (n = 3956) had delivered a second child. Mode of delivery for first and second singleton birth(s) was obtained from longitudinal survey data. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric and medical history variables were tested as predictors of mode of delivery for first and second births using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Caesarean sections accounted for 29.1% (n = 1535) of first births, consisting of 18.2% emergency and 10.9% elective caesareans. Mode of delivery for first and second births was consistent for 85.5% of women (n = 3383) who delivered both children either vaginally or via caesarean section. Higher maternal age and body mass index, short-stature, anxiety and having private health insurance were predictive of caesarean section for first births. Vaginal birth after caesarean section was more common in women who were older, short-statured, or had been overweight or obese for both children, compared to women who had two vaginal deliveries. Conclusions for Practice: Rates of caesarean section in Australia are high. Renewed efforts are needed to reduce the number of unnecessary caesarean births, with particular caution applied to first births. Interventions could focus on elective caesareans for women with private health insurance or a history of anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Researchers documenting persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status disparities in chances of cesarean delivery have speculated that women’s birth attitudes and preferences may partially explain these differences, but no studies have directly tested this hypothesis. We examined whether women’s prenatal attitudes toward vaginal delivery differed by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status, and whether attitudes were differently related to delivery mode depending on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Methods: Data were from the First Baby Study, a cohort of 3006 women who gave birth to a first baby in Pennsylvania between 2009 and 2011. We used regression models to examine (1) predictors of prenatal attitudes toward vaginal delivery, and (2) the association between prenatal attitudes and actual delivery mode. To assess moderation, we estimated models adding interaction terms. Results: Prenatal attitudes toward vaginal delivery were not associated with race/ ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Positive attitudes toward vaginal delivery were associated with lower odds of cesarean delivery (AOR = 0.60, P &lt; .001). However, vaginal delivery attitudes were only related to delivery mode among women who were white, highly educated, and privately insured. Conclusions: There are racial/ethnic differences in chances of cesarean delivery, and these differences are not explained by birth attitudes. Furthermore, our findings suggest that white and high-socioeconomic status women may be more able to realize their preferences in childbirth.

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To examine how changes in physical activity, sitting time and sleep duration through pre-, mid- and late pregnancy are in association with Caesarean section, medically indicated Caesarean section and small for gestational age. Background: While circadian activities could change throughout pregnancy, studies exploring the effect of change in those activities on pregnancy outcomes remain limited. Design: This study applied a prospective panel design. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess the three activities before and during pregnancy and was administered three times from August 2015– July 2017. Multiple logistic regression models were used. The analysis included 488, 477 and 455 participants in the models for Caesarean section, medically indicated Caesarean section and small for gestational age, respectively. This study followed the STROBE guidelines. Results: The mean age of participants was 32.18 years, and more than half (54.90%) were primiparous. Sleep duration of &gt;8 hr/day before pregnancy and experiencing a decrease in mid-pregnancy was a risk factor for Caesarean section and medically indicated Caesarean section. Sitting ≥8 hr/weekday in pre-, mid- and late pregnancy had a protective effect for Caesarean section and medically indicated Caesarean section. Sitting &lt;8 hr in mid-pregnancy and experiencing a decrease in late pregnancy was a risk factor for small-for-gestational-age infants. Physical activity was not significantly related to pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: Sleep duration of 7–8 hr and sitting time of more than 8 hr/day seem beneficial for women both before and during pregnancy. Relevance to clinical practice: Health professionals could assess pregnant women or those intending to become pregnant regarding their sleep and sitting behaviour and provide relevant interventions.

        <ab>Objective: To describe the maternal and neonatal outcomes, health care utilization, and cost to reproductive travelers for obstetric care (RTOC) at a single institution. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of women identified as reproductive travelers who delivered at Stroger Hospital in Chicago, IL when a self-pay package of obstetrical services was offered. Data included maternal characteristics and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Results: A total of 413 reproductive travelers delivered during the study period. The majority (88%) was of Nigerian citizenship. The median gestational age at first prenatal visit was 35 weeks with a median of three prenatal visits. The patients were in good health with a high prevalence of infectious disease and a low prevalence of chronic disease. Women had complex obstetric histories, and 28.6% had cesarean delivery, with the most common indication being prior uterine surgery. Severe maternal morbidity occurred in 4.1% of the women and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in 16.3% of the babies. Extra charges beyond those covered by the financial package were incurred by 230 (55.7%) of the women. Conclusion: Reproductive travelers have better obstetric outcomes and fewer NICU admissions than non-travelers who delivered at the same institution. However, the care of RTOC in this manner is fraught with challenges, including late presentation for care, lack of medical records, providers at times managing unfamiliar conditions, and unforeseen financial obligations assumed by patients.

        <ab>Abstract Purpose The aim of this study is to understand the motives behind CS requests in nulliparous women in their late pregnancy better and to investigate if specific personality traits affect the maternal decision on mode of delivery. Material and Method This prospective study was conducted with 70 healthy, nulliparous parturient with singleton pregnancies. Women at their 28–32. weeks of gestation were asked to fill a socio-demographic data form and the questionnaires; Personality Belief Questionnaire – Short Form (PBQ-SF) and The Childbirth Attitudes Questionnaire (CAQ). After delivery, all the results of pre-filled questionnaires and women’s mode of delivery were analyzed and compared. Results There were significant differences in personality types; dependent (p = 0.033), passive-aggressive (p = 0.031), obsessive-compulsive (p = 0.001), antisocial (p = 0.014), narcissistic (p = 0.014) and borderline (p = 0.014) between vaginal delivery and CS groups. The CAQ scores of the mothers who requested CS were significantly higher (p:0.007). Weak but significant positive relation was found between total CAQ scores and avoidant (p = 0.022), dependent (p = 0.034), passive-aggressive (p = 0.040), narcissistic (p = 0,006), schizoid (p = 0.007), paranoid (p = 0.007) and borderline (p = 0.007) personality types. Conclusion This is the first study that investigates the relationship between mode of delivery and personality traits according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and cognitive behavioral perspective in the literature. These personality traits can be carried at a level that is not clinically significant to create an obvious pathology, yet they might play a role as the motives behind the apparent reasons for women who request CS. Understanding women’s motives and attitudes for childbirth during their pregnancy may help healthcare providers to tailor women’s approach to childbirth to avoid unnecessary CS.

        <ab>Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic disorder in pregnancy. Pregnancies with GDM have worse outcomes compared to pregnancies with normal glucose tolerance. The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of GDM and perinatal outcomes according to the old WHO criteria and IADPSG criteria. Subjects and methods: A retrospective study included 2,405 pregnant women who delivered between January 2009 and December 2010. According to the OGTT results, pregnant women were divided into 4 groups. We analyzed the prevalence of GDM, characteristics of pregnant women and their newborns and perinatal outcomes. Results: We found significantly higher prevalence of GDM according to the IADPSG criteria compared to the WHO criteria. Pregnant women with GDM were significantly older, had higher pre-pregnancy BMI, fasting and 2-h plasma glucose. Pregnant women with GDM had worse pregnancy outcomes compared to control group. The overall proportion of overweight and obese pregnant women was the highest in the group of untreated pregnant women with GDM according to the IADPSG criteria. In this group we found significantly higher rate of fetal macrosomia and LGA. The rate of caesarean section was significantly higher in comparison to control group. Pre-eclampsia was significantly more common in groups of pregnant women with GDM compared to control group. Conclusion: IADPSG diagnostic criteria reveals more women with hyperglycemic disorders in pregnancy. A group of pregnant women who were normoglycemic according to the WHO criteria, but according to the IADPSG were diagnosed GDM, had adverse pregnancy outcomes. Lower values of glycemia, than those defined for diabetes in pregnancy, are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: Seasonal changes in mood and behaviour are commonly reported in the general population but considerably less is known regarding seasonality and pregnancy. This study investigated the relationship between seasons and depression and anxiety symptoms, salivary cortisol concentrations, custom birthweight centiles (CBWC) and placenta weight for pregnant women living in South Wales. Methods: This study utilised data from the longitudinal Grown in Wales (GiW) cohort. Women were recruited at the presurgical elective caesarean section (ELCS) appointment, when they provided saliva samples and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Data on birthweight and placental weight was extracted from medical notes. Seasonal data was available for 316 participants. Results: No association was identified between seasons and EPDS (p = .178), STAI scores (p = .544), CBWC (p = .683) or placental weight (p = .857). Significance was identified between seasons and salivary cortisol concentration (p &lt; .001), with highest levels in autumn and winter. Adjusted linear regression identified spring (B = −.05, p = .007, 95% CI −.09, −.01) and summer (B = −.06, p = .001, 95% CI −09, −.02) compared to autumn, and spring (B = −.05, p = .009, 95% CI −.09, −.01) and summer (B = −.06, p = .002, 95% CI −.10, −.02) compared to winter to be associated with decreased cortisol concentrations. Conclusion: This study found no association between season and maternally-reported mental health symptoms, birthweight by CBWC or placental weight but did between season and term salivary cortisol. This finding will have implications for studies that do not account for seasonality when using salivary cortisol as a biomarker. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aim: Epidemiological studies on associations between Caesarean sections (C‐sections) and attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been inconsistent, and we performed a meta‐analysis. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Embase to December 2018 and included nine hospital‐based and population registry studies published in 2011‐2018. These covered a total study cohort of more than 2.5 million people in eight countries: Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Turkey and the UK. The analysis provided summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) while taking heterogeneity into account. Results: We found that that C‐sections were associated with a small increase in the risk of ADHD (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11, 1.17, I² 0%) in offspring. In subgroup analyses, the association remained for both infants born after elective C‐sections (OR, 1.15, 1.11, 1.19, I2 0%) and emergency C‐sections (OR, 1.13, 1.1, 1.17, I2 45.4%). However, these were only marginally significant when we pooled data from siblings from other pregnancies (OR, 1.06, 1.00‐1.13, I2 0%), implying that the association was due to confounding. Conclusion: The statistically significant association between C‐sections and ADHD in children can be partially explained by unmeasured confounding. Further research controlling for important confounders is required before firm conclusions can be drawn. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depressive symptoms among adolescents are common. This study aimed to assess, among Chinese adolescents, the associations of habitual weekday sleep duration with depressive symptoms and whether these associations varied with the mode of birth delivery. Methods: Data were from the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey, and 150,053 students’ questionnaires were qualified for analysis. Multi-level logistic regression models were performed. Results: A weekday sleep duration of ≤5 h/night was associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.98, 95% CI = 2.75–3.24), and adolescents who reported a weekday sleep duration of 5–7 h/night (aOR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.60–1.79) and &gt;9 h/night (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.11–1.45) were also at a higher risk of depressive symptoms. Stratification analyses showed that in both adolescents delivered by vaginal birth and cesarean section (CS), a weekday sleep duration of ≤5 h/night, 5–7 h/night, and &gt;9 h/night were associated with the increased risk of depressive symptoms in the adjusted models, and the magnitudes of the aORs in adolescents delivered by CS were slightly higher than those in adolescents delivered by vaginal birth. Limitations: The cross-sectional study design and self-reported sleep duration and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a significant U-shaped association between weekday sleep duration and depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents. In both adolescents delivered by vaginal birth and CS, those who reported having abnormal sleep duration were at a high risk of depressive symptoms. Based on the findings of this study, we suggest sleep duration and mode of delivery should be a matter of concern for public health authorities.

        <ab>Aim: To provide a comprehensive update on the most prevalent, significant risk factors for neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP). Method: Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant publications up to March 2019. Studies assessing risk factors of NBPP in relation to typically developing comparison individuals were included. Meta‐analysis was performed for the five most significant risk factors, on the basis of the PRISMA statement and MOOSE guidelines. Pooled odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and across‐study heterogeneity (I2) were reported. Reporting bias and quality of evidence was rated. In addition, we assessed the incidence of NBPP. Results: Twenty‐two observational studies with a total sample size of 29 419 037 live births were selected. Significant risk factors included shoulder dystocia (OR 115.27; 95% CI 81.35–163.35; I² = 92%), macrosomia (OR 9.75; 95% CI 8.29–11.46; I² = 70%), (gestational) diabetes (OR 5.33; 95% CI 3.77–7.55; I² = 59%), instrumental delivery (OR 3.8; 95% CI 2.77–5.23; I² = 77%), and breech delivery (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.67–3.7; I² = 70%). Caesarean section appeared as a protective factor (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.11–0.16; I² = 41%). The pooled overall incidence of NBPP was 1.74 per 1000 live births. It has decreased in recent years. Interpretation: The incidence of NBPP is decreasing. Shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, instrumental delivery, and breech delivery are risk factors for NBPP. Caesarean section appears as a protective factor. What this paper adds The overall incidence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy is 1.74 per 1000 live births. The incidence has declined significantly. Shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, maternal diabetes, instrumental delivery, and breech delivery are the main risk factors. Prevention is difficult owing to unpredictability and often labour‐related risk. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 26(6) of Maternal and Child Health Journal (see record [rid]2022-66949-001[/rid]). The original version of this article contained a mistake. In the methods section, under sub-heading 'Study Design'—the text 'XXXX' should be replaced with the university name. The correct sentence is given in the erratum.] Objectives: This study aimed to 1) Examine factors associated with cessation of exclusive breastfeeding in Israel and 2) Develop predictive models to identify women at risk for early exclusive breastfeeding cessation. Methods: The study used data from longitudinal national representative infant nutrition survey in Israel (n = 2119 participants). Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors and build predictive models. Results: The rate of exclusive breastfeeding cessation increased from 45.4% at 2 months to 85.7% at 6 months. Five factors were significantly associated with higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding cessation at 2 months: being a primapara, low educational level, lack of previous breastfeeding experience, negative attitude towards birth, and lack of intention to breastfeed. Six factors were significantly associated with higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding cessation at 6 months: younger age, being in a relationship with a partner, lower religiosity level, cesarean delivery, not taking folic acid during pregnancy, and negative attitude towards birth. Both 2 and 6-months models had good predictive performance (C-statistic of .72 and .68, accordingly). Conclusions for Practice: This nationwide study successfully identified several predictors of exclusive breastfeeding cessation and created breastfeeding cessation prediction tools for two time periods (2 and 6 months). The resulting tools can be applied to identify women at risk for stopping exclusive breastfeeding in hospitals or at community clinics. Further studies should examine practical aspects of applying these tools in practice and explore whether applying those tools can lead to higher exclusive breastfeeding rates.

        <ab>ObjectiveTo study the relationship between cesarean Delivery (CD) and overweight in preschool children, considering the presence of birth aspects and demographic characteristics that have been associated with the risk of excess weight.MethodsThis retrospective cross-sectional analysis used representative data of children from 2 to 6 years of age at municipal daycare centers in Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil. The sample included 752 preschoolers. Weight and height were collected in daycare centers, and the nutritional status classification was performed using z scores of Body Mass Index (zBMI). Data analysis was performed in the bivariate and multivariate manner, the latter with the inclusion of another possible risk factor. Adjustments were made for daycare centers time, sex, birth length and weight and maternal schooling.ResultsThe mean age of preschool children was 4.7 years, and 53.8% were boys. The prevalence of overweight children was 21.7%. The median zBMI of the children born by CD was higher than that of vaginal Delivery (p = 0.0194). The prevalence of overweight showed association with CD (p = 0.0196; PR = 1.397 with 95% CI of 1065–1831). Logistic binary multivariate regression analysis confirmed the association, even in the presence of other possible risk factors (CR: 1.580, 95% CI: 1.072–2.330).Conclusion for PracticeBirth by CD is one of the factors that are associated with the early development of overweight in preschoolers.

In the original article, there was a mistake in the supplementary file. The delivery DRG codes were incorrect in Supplementary Table 1. The Supplementary Table 1 is corrected.] ObjectivesTo examine recent rates of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPM) of contraception use during delivery hospitalization and correlates of their use.MethodsA retrospective cohort study utilizing the 2012–2016 National Inpatient Sample of hospitalizations in the United States of America. The International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to identify deliveries, inpatient long-acting reversible contraception (IPP LARC), and postpartum tubal ligation (PPTL). We conducted univariable and multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between demographic, clinical, hospital and geographical characteristics with likelihood of LAPM including IPP LARC and PPTL.ResultsOur sample included 3,642,328 unweighted deliveries. The rate of IPP LARC increased from 34.6 to 54.9 per 10,000 deliveries (58.7%), while the rate of PPTL utilization decreased from 719.5 to 671.8 per 10,000 deliveries (6.6%) over the study period. In multivariable analysis of LAPM utilization versus neither, cesarean delivery (aOR 7.25, 95% CI 7.08–7.43) was associated with greater utilization. Native American (aOR 4.01, 95% CI 2.91–5.53) race was associated with increased use of IPP LARC compared to a non-long-acting method of contraception. Age between 18 and 29 years (aOR 6.21, 95% CI 5.42–7.11) was associated with greater use of IPP LARC versus PPTL. Delivering in a rural hospital ((aOR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06–0.12) and cesarean delivery (aOR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06–0.12) were associated with greater use PPTL versus IPP LARC.ConclusionsThe IPP LARC rate remains at less than 10% the PPTL rates in our study timeframe. The demonstrated variation in uptake of highly effective methods of contraception inpatient after delivery offer possible opportunities for better understanding and improvement in access.

        <ab>Objectives: The cesarean delivery (CD) rate is increasing worldwide. An internationally recognized classification system had been required to analyse the trend and its possible consequences in a standardized manner. The goal of this study was to identify the main contributors to the CD rate at the Medical University of Vienna in an 11-year time period (2003–2013) and to analyse neonatal outcome parameters within the ten Robson categories. Methods: This is a retrospective data-analysis of singleton and twin pregnancies in cephalic, breech and transverse presentation with a gestational age between 23 and 42 weeks. The cases were divided into ten classes based on the Robson criteria. CD rates and perinatal outcome parameters were analysed within each Robson class. The outcome parameters included: NICU-admission rate and 5 min Apgar score values &lt; 7. Results: The overall CD rate was at 44.2%. Within Robson class 5 the CD rate was the highest at 99.1%. Main contributors were Robson class 5 at 20.6%, followed by class 2 at 17.1% and class 8 at 15.0%. Neonatal outcome analyses revealed significant differences between the Robson classes. Conclusions: The main contributors to the CD rate were determined. We suggest reconsidering the frequently applied birth mode especially for Robson class 2, 4, 5 and 8. Lowering the CD rate could be achievable, if a careful delivery management and an individual risk evaluation is provided. It is important to reduce the CD rate in the individual Robson classes under consideration of perinatal outcome parameters, since a reduction should only take place where it is clinically useful and relevant.

        <ab>Aims and objectives: This research was conducted to explore the effectiveness of employing the healthcare failure mode and effect analysis method in the management of trial of labour after caesarean, with the aims of increasing vaginal birth after caesarean section rate and reducing potential risks that might cause severe complications. Background: Previously high caesarean section rate in China and the 'two children' policy leads to the situation where multiparas are faced with the choice of another caesarean or trial of labour after caesarean. Despite evidences showing the benefits of vaginal birth after caesarean, obstetricians and midwives in China tend to be conservative due to limited experience and insufficient clinical routines. Thus, its management needs further optimisation in order to make the practice safe and sound. Design: A prospective quality improvement programme using the healthcare failure mode and effect analysis. Methods: With the structured methodology of healthcare failure mode and effect analysis, we determined core processes of antepartum and intrapartum management, conducted risk priority numbers and devised remedial protocols for failure modes with high risks. The programme was then implemented as a clinical routine under the agreement of the institutional review board and vaginal birth after caesarean success rates were compared before and after the quality improvement programme, both descriptively and statistically. Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 checklist was chosen on reporting the study process. Results: Seventy failure modes in seven core processes were identified in the management process, with 14 redressed for actions. The 1‐year follow‐up trial of labour after caesarean and vaginal birth after caesarean rate was increased compared with the previous 3 years, with a vaginal birth after caesarean rate of 86.36%, whereas the incidence of uterine rupture was not compromised. Conclusions: The application of healthcare failure mode and effect analysis can not only promote trial of labour after caesarean and vaginal birth after caesarean rate, but also maintaining a low risk of uterine rupture. Relevance to clinical practice: This modified vaginal birth after caesarean management protocol has been shown effective in increasing its successful rate, which can be continued for further comparison of severe complications to the previous practice.

        <ab>Background: The decrease in trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) at institutions that offer this option suggests that patient preference could be a factor in the declining TOLAC rate. However, data regarding how women value the potential processes and outcomes of TOLAC and elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) are limited. We sought to determine how women view the processes and outcomes of TOLAC and ERCD and identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with these preferences. Materials and Methods: This is a multicenter cross-sectional study of mode of delivery preferences among TOLAC-eligible women at 26–34 weeks gestation. The time tradeoff metric was used to obtain utilities for the processes and outcomes of TOLAC and ERCD. Multivariable regression analysis was utilized to identify independent predictors of utilities. Results: The 299 study participants constituted a geographically and racially/ethnically diverse group. Although uncomplicated TOLAC resulting in vaginal birth after cesarean and uncomplicated ERCD resulted in high utility values, any alteration in either the process or outcome resulted in substantial utility decrements. In multivariable regression analysis, race/ethnicity, insurance status, and order of scenario presentation emerged as statistically significant predictors. Conclusions: Information regarding both maternal and infant implications is important to women in discussions about approach to delivery. Both the way in which information regarding labor interventions and potential complications is presented and the characteristics of the women contemplating this information affect its impact. These findings underscore the need for evidence-based decision support to help create realistic expectations and incorporate informed patient preferences into decision-making to optimize both clinical outcomes and individual patient experience for women with a prior cesarean delivery.

        <ab>Background: Relatively little is known about the effects of mode of delivery on long-term health-related quality-of-life outcomes. Furthermore, no previous study has expressed these outcomes in preference-based (utility) metrics. Methods: The study population comprised 2,161 mothers recruited from a prospective population-based study in the East Midlands of England encompassing live births and stillbirths between 32+0 and 36+6 weeks’ gestation and a sample of term-born controls. Perinatal data were extracted from the mothers’ maternity records. Health-related quality-of-life outcomes were assessed at 12 months postpartum, using the EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) measure with responses to the EQ-5D descriptive system converted into health utility scores. Descriptive statistics and multivariable analyses were used to estimate the relationship between the mode of delivery and health-related quality-of-life outcomes. Results: The overall health-related quality-of-life profile of the women in the study cohort mirrored that of the English adult population as revealed by national health surveys. A significantly higher proportion of women delivering by cesarean delivery reported some, moderate, severe, or extreme pain or discomfort at 12 months postpartum than women undergoing spontaneous vaginal delivery. Multivariable analyses, using the Ordinary Least Squares estimator revealed that, after controlling for maternal sociodemographic characteristics, cesarean delivery without maternal or fetal compromise was associated with a significant EQ-5D utility decrement in comparison to spontaneous vaginal delivery among all women ( 0.026; p = 0.038) and among mothers of term-born infants ( 0.062; p &lt; 0.001). Among mothers of term-born infants, this result was replicated in models that controlled for all maternal and infant characteristics (utility decrement of 0.061; p &lt; 0.001). The results were confirmed by sensitivity analyses that varied the categorization of the main exposure variable (mode of delivery) and the econometric strategy. Conclusions: Among mothers of term-born infants, cesarean delivery without maternal or fetal compromise is associated with poorer long-term health-related quality of life in comparison to spontaneous vaginal delivery. Further longitudinal studies are needed to understand the magnitude, trajectory, and underpinning mechanisms of health-related quality-of-life outcomes following different modes of delivery.

        <ab>Objectives: To evaluate the effect of race and ethnicity on differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes among U.S.-born and foreign-born women, as well as racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes within these groups. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed singleton pregnancies (n = 11,518) among women delivering at Boston Medical Center from January 2010–March 2015. Outcomes of interest included preterm birth, early preterm birth, cesarean delivery, hypertensive disorders, diabetes, low birth weight at term (LBW, &lt; 2500 g), NICU admission and intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing outcomes between U.S.- and foreign-born women were calculated and stratified by race. Obstetric outcomes among Black and Hispanic women were compared to those of white women within both U.S.- and foreign-born groups. Results: Preterm birth, hypertensive disorders, LBW and NICU admission were more likely to occur among U.S.-born women and their neonates compared to foreign-born women. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics did not significantly impact these disparities. Among foreign-born women, Black women had a higher prevalence of many maternal and neonatal complications, while Hispanic women had a lower prevalence of some complications compared to white women. Black woman and infants consistently exhibit worse outcomes regardless of their nativity, while Hispanic women foreign-born women experience less disparate outcomes. Conclusions for Practice: Overall, women born in the United States are at higher risk of several adverse perinatal outcomes compared to foreign-born women. Racial and ethnic disparities in birth outcomes exist in both groups. However, the complex interplay between biopsychosocial influences that mediate these inequities appear to have different effects among U.S- and foreign-born women. A better understanding of these factors can be used to combat disparities and improve outcomes for all women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aims: The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of pregnant women who wish to have a caesarean section. Methods: Data were collected as part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Pregnant women booked for antenatal care in Norway between 1999 and 2006 were invited to participate in the study. Data on women’s interest in mode of delivery and a set of associated variables were gathered from a questionnaire completed by 55,859 women at 30 weeks of pregnancy. Results: A wish for caesarean section was expressed by 10% of the women, and 33% thought that the woman herself should be allowed to decide whether to have a caesarean section or not. A negative experience from a previous labour, a second birth, an age &gt;35, a low level of education, being single, being unemployed, having an assisted conception, expecting more than one foetus, experiencing urinary and bowel incontinence before current pregnancy, experiencing pelvic pain, having a fear of childbirth and reporting negative intra-psychic phenomena were significantly associated with a wish for caesarean section. Conclusions: At 30 weeks of pregnancy, one out of 10 women in a sample of Norwegian women would choose a caesarean section. Negative experiences from previous pregnancies and fear of giving birth are two of the strongest factors associated with a wish for a caesarean section and should be taken into consideration.

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between pregnancy-specific anxiety and elective cesarean section, and identify the critical period in which pregnancy-specific anxiety will affect the elective cesarean section. Primiparous women in the 1st trimester of pregnancy were invited to participate in the cohort. General information on maternal socio-demographic characteristics and environmental exposure were collected using questionnaires. Pregnancy-specific anxiety was assessed by using pregnancy-specific anxiety questionnaire in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively. Delivery modes and pregnancy complications were abstracted from medical notes. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was adopted to examine the relationship between pregnancy-specific anxiety and elective cesarean section. Results indicated the overall elective cesarean section rate in this study was 45%. Among 1 874 pregnant women, 30.9% women experienced anxiety at least once during pregnancy, and 6.9% women suffered from anxiety in all three trimesters. Anxiety in the 2nd trimester was a significant predictor for elective cesarean section. Young maternal age and low educational level had indirect effects on women’s choice of elective caesarean section through affecting pregnancy-specific anxiety. More attention should be paid to maternal psychological problems, and professional counseling needs to be strengthened to protect women from pregnancy-specific anxiety.

        <ab>Objective: Intracranial hypertension is a life-threatening condition that requires emergent diagnosis and management. Although pentobarbital coma for refractory intracranial hypertension has been studied in the general population, this study is the first reported case of pentobarbital coma use in a pregnant patient. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of a pregnant patient with refractory intracranial hypertension and reviewed the current literature on the role of pentobarbital coma. Results: We present the case of a 35-year-old woman at 26 weeks of gestation who developed refractory intracranial hypertension secondary to rupture of a dural arteriovenous fistula. The patient was taken to surgery for decompressive hemicraniectomy, clot evacuation, and dural arteriovenous fistula resection. Subsequently, the patient was treated with pentobarbital coma for 5 days and achieved adequate control of her intracranial pressures. The patient and fetus were closely monitored by the obstetrics team with no apparent harm to fetal well-being during her hospital stay. The patient underwent planned cesarean delivery at term, and both the mother and newborn were discharged in stable condition with no known pentobarbital-related complications. Conclusions: Thus, we present the first case report demonstrating that pentobarbital coma may be a safe and efficacious option for treating pregnant patients with life-threatening refractory intracranial hypertension. We also provide dosing information for pentobarbital administration. Additional studies and reports involving pregnant patients are needed to better understand the impact of pentobarbital on both the mother and fetus. Furthermore, long-term follow-up of both the mother and newborn is critical to identifying any delayed sequelae of neonatal exposure to pentobarbital.

        <ab>Little is known about the contribution of pregnancy-related parental and perinatal factors to the development of stress-related disorders. We aimed to investigate whether parental/perinatal adversities entail higher risks of stress-related disorders in the offspring, later in life, by accounting for genetic and early environmental factors. Based on the nationwide Swedish registers, we conducted a population-based cohort study of 3,435,747 singleton births (of which 2,554,235 were full siblings), born 1973–2008 and survived through the age of 5 years. Using both population- and sibling designs, we employed Cox regression to assess the association between parental and perinatal factors with subsequent risk of stress-related disorders. We identified 55,511 individuals diagnosed with stress-related disorders in the population analysis and 37,433 in the sibling analysis. In the population-based analysis we observed increased risks of stress-related disorders among offspring of maternal/paternal age &lt;25, single mothers, parity ≥4, mothers with BMI ≥ 25 or maternal smoking in early pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and offspring born moderately preterm (GA 32–36 weeks), or small-for-gestational-age. These associations were significantly attenuated toward null in the sibling analysis. Cesarean-section was weakly associated with offspring stress-related disorders in population [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.12] and sibling analyses (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.20). Our findings suggest that most of the observed associations between parental and perinatal factors and risk of stress-related disorders in the population analysis are driven by shared familial environment or genetics, and underscore the importance of family designs in epidemiological studies on the etiology of psychiatric disorders.

        <ab>Aims: We aimed to assess the association of postpartum maternal serum concentration of orexin-A with postpartum marital satisfaction considering the effect of mode of delivery as an influential factor. Methods: This cohort study conducted among third trimester pregnant women, who met our eligibility criteria. Postpartum maternal and cord serum concentration of orexin-A were measured and their association with postpartum marital satisfaction were assessed considering the impact of mode of delivery. Results: There was a statistically significant positive association between postpartum maternal and cord serum levels of orexin-A (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001) and postpartum marital satisfaction among women with cesarean section (r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01). The maternal orexin-A level of women delivered with cesarean section who had post-partum marital dissatisfaction was significantly lower than those one with marital satisfaction (84.13 ± 95.88 vs. 153.08 ± 95.88 pg/ml, p = 0.04). Logistic regression model showed that the type of delivery was not related to marital satisfaction (OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 0.6, 4.8), p¼0.280). Conclusions: The postpartum maternal serum orexin-A level was associated with marital satisfaction in women delivered through cesarean section.

        <ab>Objective: City Birth Trauma Scale is a recently developed scale specifically designed for evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth based on the DSM–5 criteria (Ayers, Wright, &amp; Thornton, 2018). Previous studies showed a two-factor structure of PTSD symptoms in postpartum women; however, more complex models were not tested. This study aimed to validate the Croatian version of the City Birth Trauma Scale and determine the latent factor structure of postpartum PTSD. Method: In a cross-sectional study, 603 women completed online questionnaires comprising the City Birth Trauma Scale, Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the anxiety subscale from the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the bifactor model of birth-related symptoms and general symptoms had an excellent fit to the data. Both subscales and the total scale showed high internal consistency (α = .92). Convergent and divergent validity testing showed high validity, especially for birth-related symptoms. Discriminant validity was confirmed with primiparous women and women who gave birth by instrumental vaginal delivery and emergency caesarean section having significantly higher scores on birth-related symptoms, but not on general symptoms, suggesting high discriminant validity of the birth-related symptoms subscale. Conclusions: The City Birth Trauma Scale is a reliable and valid measure. Both total scale score and subscale scores can be calculated. It is highly recommended for use in postpartum population.

        <ab>Clinical Impact Statement—City Birth Trauma Scale is specifically designed for evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth based on the DSM–5 criteria (Ayers, Wright, &amp;amp; Thornton, 2018). This study aimed at determining its psychometric characteristics in a sample of postpartum Croatian women. PTSD symptoms have two dimensions: birth-related symptoms (e.g., distressing memories and avoiding thinking about the birth) and general symptoms (e.g., negative mood, irritability, and tension). Primiparous women and those who had an instrumental vaginal delivery and emergency caesarean section reported more PTSD symptoms. The scale is a reliable, valid measure, and highly recommended for use in the postpartum population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Studies of obstetric quality of care have almost exclusively focused on severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and have rarely examined more common complications. Methods: This 2016–2018 retrospective, population-based cohort study analyzed maternal delivery outcomes at 127 Illinois hospitals. International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 Revision codes were used to describe the incidence of SMM and route-specific complications. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the association of maternal sociodemographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics with the likelihood of coded complications. Results: Among 421,426 deliveries, the SMM rate was 1.4% overall, 0.4% for vaginal, and 2.8% for cesarean delivery. Other complications were documented for 6.9% of women with vaginal and 10.0% of women with cesarean deliveries. While SMM rates were stable, vaginal delivery complications increased 5.9% from 2016 to 2018 and cesarean delivery complications increased 13.8%. Patient age, minority race and ethnicity, high poverty level, and preexisting and pregnancy-related clinical conditions were significantly associated with each complication outcome. Higher hospital delivery volume was associated with higher route-specific complications. Conclusion: SMM significantly underestimates the incidence of maternal complications. Complicated deliveries have much higher charges and length of stay, although ICD-10 coding intensity may influence incidence. New outcome measures based on more detailed clinical data and linked antepartum and postpartum care will be necessary to improve obstetric quality of care measurement.

        <ab>Background: Women with visual impairment may have reduced ability to access standard care resources, however, information on their pregnancy and neonatal outcomes is limited. Objective: To assess risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among visually impaired women in Washington State from 1987 to 2014. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked Washington State birth/fetal death hospital discharge records to compare outcomes among women with and without visual impairment noted at their delivery hospitalization. Pregnancy conditions and outcomes evaluated included gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, labor induction and cesarean delivery. Neonatal outcomes included preterm delivery and birth weight &lt; 2500 g. We assessed length of maternal and infant delivery hospitalization. We performed Poisson regression to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome, adjusting for year of delivery, maternal age, and parity. Results: Most adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were similar for visually impaired (N = 232) and comparison women (N = 2362). However, visually impaired women had increased risks of severe pre-eclampsia (RR 3.77, 95% CI 1.69–8.43), labor induction (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10–1.61) and preterm delivery (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.06–2.42). They were also more likely to have delivery hospitalizations of 3 or more days following a vaginal (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.41–2.47). Among cesarean deliveries, infants of visually impaired women had increased risk (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02–1.51) of hospitalization for 3 or more days postpartum. Conclusion: Our findings may be useful for obstetric providers in counseling their visually impaired patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>ABSTRACT This study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression and impaired sexual function following the hysterectomy in Iran. This study was performed as a retrospective cohort study, from August 2017 to August 2018. Fifty-two patients with a cesarean hysterectomy and 52 with cesarean section were considered as the cases and controls, respectively. Depression and sexual function were assessed 3–6 months following the surgery in both cases and controls. Depression was evaluated by using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire-II-Persian. Sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The average BDI in cases was 15.37 ± 7.6 and in controls was 13.06 ± 6.7. Mild to moderate depression was detected 57.3 percent of whom with hysterectomy and 36.5 percent of whom with C/S, the BDI sum score did not differ significantly between cases and controls (p = .096). The FSFI in cases was 20.06 ± 6.96, and controls was 21.7 ± 9.83 without any significant difference (p = .364). The depression had not been significantly different between women who underwent hysterectomy and were not following 3–6 months after surgery. Furthermore, both groups had impaired sexual function after the surgery. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Rationale: The extent of pregnancy in adolescents and young adults, especially in low and middle‐income countries, is a source of increasing concern given its social and economic impact. Aims and Objective: We hypothesized that there would be correlations between female patients becoming pregnant at a young age and practices such as harmful alcohol misuse, cigarette smoking, and drug use, the use of toxic substances, low educational attainment, and an essential absence of health care seeking about the outcome of adolescent pregnancies. Methods: We performed a prospective cross‐sectional study of patients who gave birth between August and November 2017 at St. Pantelimon Emergency Hospital in Bucharest, Romania. Seventy‐four patients aged 14 to 20 years, with a mean maternal age of 18.07 years, were enrolled in the study and answered a 15‐item questionnaire about their social, educational, and medical background. Results: Fifty‐three patients (71.6%) gave birth by caesarean section and 21 (28.3%) by vaginal delivery. Notably, patients aged 14 to 16 years had a lower rate of caesarean delivery compared with those aged 17 to 20 years. Moreover, 83.0% of the caesarean sections and 76.1% of the vaginal deliveries were at term. With reference to age and type of delivery, women are more likely to give birth by caesarean section at any age group (the association is not statistically significant at P &lt; .05), except for the age of 15 years (five out of six patients in our sample had a spontaneous birth). Smoking was the most common risk behavior in the sample (45.9%, n = 34), followed by alcohol consumption (17.5%, n = 13) and drug use (5.40%, n = 4). Conclusions: A high percentage of caesarean delivery was reported, particularly in patients aged &gt; 17 years. The percentage of female participants who underwent a caesarean delivery for their second pregnancy was significantly higher than compared with primipara participants. Patients receiving consistent antenatal care visits compared with those who did not monitor their pregnancy did not differ in the likelihood of undergoing a caesarean section.

        <ab>Purpose: To evaluate trends and factors associated with mode of delivery in the rural Southwest Trifinio region of Guatemala. Description: We conducted a retrospective analysis of self-reported antepartum factors and postpartum outcomes recorded in a quality improvement database among 430 women enrolled in a home-based maternal healthcare program between June 1, 2015 and August 1, 2017. Assessment: Over the study period, the rates of cesarean delivery (CD) increased (from 30 to 45%) and rates of vaginal delivery (VD) decreased (70–55%) while facility-based delivery attendance remained stable around 70%. Younger age (23.5 years for VD vs. 21.6 years for CD, p &lt; 0.001), nulliparity (25.1% for VD vs. 45.0% for CD, p &lt; 0.001), prolonged/obstructed labor (2.4% for VD vs. 55.6% for CD, p &lt; 0.001), and fetal malpresentation (0% for VD vs. 16.3% CD, p &lt; 0.001) significantly influenced mode of delivery in univariate analysis. The leading indications for CD were labor dysfunction (47.5%), malpresentation (14.5%), and prior cesarean delivery (19.8%). The CD rate among the subpopulation of term, nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies in vertex presentation also increased from 20% of all CD in 2015, to 38% in 2017. Conclusion: Among low-income women from rural Guatemala, the CD rate has increased above the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations in a period of 3 years. Additional research on the factors affecting this trend are essential to guide interventions that might improve the appropriateness of CD, and to determine if reducing or stabilizing rates is necessary.

        <ab>Objective: The growing opioid crisis increasingly affects maternal care in the US and it is unknown if opioid use puts pregnant women at increased odds for cesarean delivery (CD). Understanding how opioids influence CD trends is important in improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study aims to understand the association of opioid use with CD in the context of the demographic, clinical, behavioral, and health system complexity. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional analysis used representative data from the 2012–2014 National Inpatient Sample. Opioid use during pregnancy, CD, and other clinical variables were identified using ICD9 codes. Characteristics were assessed using bivariate and multivariate statistics. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association between opioid use and CD while controlling for confounders. Adjustments were made for rural/urban hospital location, regional median income, maternal age, race, and medical and pregnancy-related conditions. Results: The rate of CD in the overall sample was about 30%. Among opioids-users, the overall proportion of CD was significantly less (24.7%). The adjusted odds ratio for CD among opioids users was 0.74 (CI: 0.73–0.76, p &lt; 0.001). This finding is unique to pregnant women who are covered by public insurance. In rural areas, the relationship between opioid use and CD was not significant. Conclusion: Opioid use during pregnancy is associated with lower CD rates in urban settings. This evidence suggests that maternal care varies between rural and urban areas in relation to CD of pregnant opioid users compared to non-opioid users.

        <ab>The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the predictors of choosing mode of delivery (MOD) among Iranian urban women applying the socio-ecological model. In 2015, a convenient sample of 530 pregnant women in urban regions of Urmia, Iran, was recruited to complete a socio-ecological approach–based questionnaire. Then, 1 week after childbirth, the women were followed up by telephone to be asked about their MOD (response rate = 81.88%). Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of cesarean section (CS) among the women with university education, whose husbands were an employee in a governmental organization, who preferred a private hospital for delivery, and who selected the CS as the preferred MOD during pregnancy were significantly higher than their counterparts. Among all the factors, the socioeconomic status of the families was more influential in predicting the MOD among women. The cognitive factors like fear of childbirth may not be determinants for MOD if women are from privileged families. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Due to the high risk of contamination, the practice of bottle feeding with a nipple is discouraged by the governments around the world. This study aims to examine the prevalence and factors associated with bottle feeding among children aged 0–23 months in Indonesia. Methods: Data from the 2017 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) of Indonesia were used with a cross-sectional study design. The research included last-born children aged 0–23 months using a sample of 6,763 mother–baby pairs. The independent variables included marital status, mother’s education and occupation, wealth quintile, place of residence, type of delivery, sex of child, and child’s age. The dependent variable in this study was using bottle feeding. Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression were used to examine the association between bottle feeding and related factors. Results: The prevalence of bottle feeding in Indonesia was 37.9%. Multivariate analysis showed that mothers with a higher education level (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 4.9, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.3–10.3), working mothers (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4–1.8), richest family (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5–2.3), urban living (AOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.8), caesarean delivery (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3–1.8), female child (AOR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7–0.9) and children aged 6–23 (AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.6) were significantly associated with the use of bottle feeding relative to their counterparts. Conclusion: The increased risks of using bottle feeding have been significantly associated with maternal and child factors as well as the wealth index and urban residence. Continued support of discouragement of bottle feeding policy needs to be enhanced by considering significant variables in this study.

        <ab>The primary aim of the study was to analyze differences in post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and quality of life (QoL) between women with and without severe fear of childbirth postpartum (PP FOC). The secondary aims were to analyze the correlation between PP FOC and PTSS, and PP FOC and QoL, in women undergoing complicated childbirth. This cross-sectional study was conducted in South-East Sweden. Women aged ≥ 18 years who had undergone complicated childbirth (i.e., acute or emergency cesarean section, vacuum extraction, child in need of neonatal care, manual placenta removal, sphincter rupture, shoulder dystocia, or hemorrhage ≥ 1000 ml) were invited. Seventy-six women answered demographic questions and three validated instruments measuring PP FOC, PTSS, and QoL. The study population was divided into two sub groups: severe PP FOC or no severe PP FOC. Statistical analyses were conducted using Mann–Whitney U-test, chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, and Spearman’s rank-order correlation. Severe PP FOC was reported by 29% of the women, and 18% reported PTSS indicating post-traumatic stress disorder. Women with severe PP FOC reported significantly higher levels of PTSS, and significantly lower QoL in five dimensions: physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, and social functioning. There was a positive significant correlation between level of PP FOC and PTSS. There were also significant negative correlations between level of PP FOC and most of the QoL dimensions. In conclusion, almost one-third of the women with complicated childbirth reported severe PP FOC, and almost one-fifth reported PTSS indicating post-traumatic stress disorder. PP FOC correlated with PTSS and deteriorated QoL. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Women with disabilities are at an increased risk for adverse birth outcomes; however, research among women with congenital neuromuscular disabilities (cNMD) is limited. Objective: To describe characteristics and compare birth outcomes among women with and without cNMD. Methods: Data were from the Slone Birth Defects Study (case-control, conducted from 1976 to 2015), which collected information on demographic, reproductive, and lifestyle characteristics. cNMD included spina bifida, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, contractures, or arthrogryposis and were identified by participant report. Those with cNMD were matched to participants without cNMD by interview year and study site. We use modified Poisson regression to estimate relative risks (RR) for low birthweight, macrosomia, preterm birth, and small/large-for-gestational age (SGA/LGA). Given the case-control design and overrepresentation of infants with congenital anomalies, data were weighted to reflect a 3% national prevalence of infants with congenital anomalies. Results: Women with cNMD (n = 125) were more likely to be white, nulliparous, have a cesarean section, have an unplanned pregnancy, report a pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², smoke during pregnancy, and report genitourinary infections. Women with cNMD had infants with shorter gestational length (mean difference: −7.44 days, 95% CI: −13.94, −0.95) compared to women without cNMD. cNMD was associated with higher risk of preterm birth (RR = 3.98, 95% CI: 1.33, 11.95) and SGA (RR = 2.14, 95% CI: 0.74, 6.15). Conclusion: Women with cNMD were more likely to deliver preterm and have an SGA infant. These findings highlight disparities faced by women with cNMD and stress the need to provide optimal perinatal and reproductive care.

        <ab>Background: A woman's childbirth experience has an influence on her future preferred mode of delivery. This study aimed to identify determinants for women who changed from preferring a planned vaginal birth to an elective cesarean section after their first childbirth. Methods: This prospective longitudinal observational study involved two units that provide obstetric care in Hong Kong. A mail survey was sent to 259 women 6 months after their first childbirth. These women had participated in a longitudinal cohort study that examined their preference for elective cesarean section in the antenatal period of their first pregnancies. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify determinants for women who changed from preferring vaginal birth to elective cesarean section. Results: Twenty-four percent (23.8%, 95% CI 18.4-29.3) of women changed from preferring vaginal birth to elective cesarean section after their first childbirth. Determinants found to be positively associated with this change included actual delivery by elective cesarean section (OR 106.3, 95% CI 14.7-767.4) intrauterine growth restriction (OR 19.5, 95% CI 1.1-353.6), actual delivery by emergency cesarean section (OR 8.4, 95% CI 3.4-20.6), higher family income (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-8.8), use of epidural analgesia (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0-6.8), and higher trait anxiety score (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3). The most important reason for women who changed from preferring vaginal birth to elective cesarean section was fear of vaginal birth (24.4%). Conclusions: A significant proportion of women changed their preferred mode of delivery after their first childbirth. Apart from reducing the number of cesarean sections in nulliparous women, prompt provision of education to women who had complications and investigations into fear factors during vaginal birth might help in reducing women's wish to change to elective cesarean section.

        <ab>Objective: To examine sleep–wake cycle (SWC) composition of healthy term infants in the immediate postnatal period using EEG, and investigate factors that might influence it. Methods: Multichannel video-EEG was recorded for a median of 61.9min (IQR: 60.0–69.3). The absolute and relative scores of sleep states were calculated for each infant’s recording. Parametric/non-parametric statistical tests and multiple linear regression analysis were used to investigate the influence of perinatal factors on SWC composition. Results: Eighty healthy term infants aged 1–36h were studied. A well-developed SWC was evident as early as within the first 6h after birth. The mean (SD) percentage of active sleep (AS) was 52.1% (12.9) and quiet sleep (QS) was 38.6% (12.5). AS was longer and QS shorter in infants delivered by elective caesarean section (CS) compared to infants delivered by vaginal delivery or emergency CS. Conclusions: This is the first large cohort EEG study that has quantified neonatal sleep. SWC is clearly present immediately after birth, it is dominated by AS, and is influenced by mode of delivery. Significance: This knowledge of the early neonatal EEG/SWC can be used as reference data for EEG studies of neurologically compromised infants.

        <ab>Aim: The aim of the present study was to determine whether being born to non‐diabetic mother with a family history of diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with higher rates of long‐term neurological hospitalisations of the offspring. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all live births and paediatric hospitalisations at Soroka University Medical Center between 1991 and 2014 was performed. Family history of DM was collected from prepartum women using anamnesis. During the study period, 208 728 deliveries met the inclusion criteria, and of them 8.2% (n = 17 040) were of non‐diabetic mothers with family history of DM. Rates of neurological hospitalisation with or without family history were analysed. Results: Offspring born to non‐diabetic mothers with family history of DM had higher rates of neurological hospitalisations. The cumulative incidence of long‐term neurological hospitalisations was higher as compared with those without family history of DM (log‐rank test P = .007). Neurological hospitalisations was higher by 13% in the study group, after controlling for confounders such as maternal age, maternal obesity, hypertensive disorders, birth weight and caesarean delivery. (adjusted odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.04‐1.23). Conclusion: Being born to a non‐diabetic mother with a family history of DM is independently associated with higher long‐term neurological hospitalisations of the offspring.

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the effects of caesarian section (CS) versus vaginal birth (VB) delivery techniques on results from neonatal hearing screening tests (NHSTs). Design: Retrospective analysis. Study sample: A total of 10,767 neonates divided into two groups according to delivery technique underwent NHSTs. Those who failed TEOAE or AABR were sent for diagnostic ABR examination. Results: A total of 5620 of 6044 (92.9%) of the neonates in the CS group passed the TEOAE test bilaterally and 424 (7.1%) failed either unilaterally or bilaterally. In the VB group, 4496 of 4723 (95.1%) neonates passed the TEOAE test bilaterally, while the remaining 227 (4.9%) failed the test either unilaterally or bilaterally. Bilateral passing rate of TEOAE test results was significantly higher in the VB group than the CS group (p &lt; 0.05). The AABR failure rate (unilaterally or bilaterally) was 1% in the CS group, which was significantly higher than that in the VB group (0.6%). Diagnostic ABR bilateral pass rate was not statistically different between the groups. Conclusions: Delivery method was shown to affect the results of NHSTs. We found that the rates of failing the TEOAE and screening AABR examinations were higher among neonates born by CS compared to VB. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aim: This paper is a report of a study conducted to examine changes in personality from late pregnancy to early motherhood in primiparas having vaginal or caesarean deliveries. Background: Birth of the first child is a major life event, possibly influencing personality. The physiological and emotional processes that start in pregnant women have a major impact on the evolving mother-child relationship. Knowledge about changes in personality during pregnancy and motherhood is scarce. Method: A prospective, group-comparative cohort study including 314 healthy primiparas having either 'caesarean section on maternal request' (n = 74) or 'spontaneous vaginal delivery group' (n = 240). The self-report inventory Karolinska Personality Scales was mailed to participants at 37-39 gestational weeks in pregnancy and 9 months after delivery. Data were collected from January 2003 to June 2006. Results: All mean values of the personality variables were within the normal range. There was a statistically significant increase in Impulsivity (P = 0·046) and decrease in Socialization (P = 0·004). The scores developed differently depending on mode of delivery. Thus, women in the vaginal delivery group increased their scores on the Psychic anxiety and Guilt scales, while those in the caesarean delivery group decreased their scores. Although women in both groups became more impulsive and less socialized, personality remained comparatively stable in the transition from late pregnancy to motherhood. Conclusion: As interactive therapeutic midwife/client relationships and maternal/social role preparation have been shown to have a great effect on progress in becoming a mother, knowledge about how personality may affect this process is important so that healthcare professionals can attempt to reduce women's anxiety levels during pregnancy.

        <ab>Purpose: The present study assessed the effects of several prenatal maternal expectations on postpartum depression (PPD), while considering two relevant factors-incongruence between planned and actual birth and the rigidity of the birth plan – that can affect whether maternal expectations act as protective factors or risk factors for PPD. Methods: Primiparous women (N = 527) were recruited to a longitudinal study about women’s birth choices and experiences. At time 1, during pregnancy, women completed a questionnaire assessing prenatal depression, preferred birth plan, birth plan flexibility–rigidity and maternal expectations (i.e. Natural-Fulfillment, Infant-Reflects-Mothering, Sacrifice). At time 2, two-months post-partum, they reported their actual birth mode and answered a questionnaire assessing their PPD symptoms. Results: Natural-fulfillment maternal expectations were negatively related to PPD symptoms. Yet, the interaction of high natural-fulfillment expectations with an unfulfilled birth plan and the rigidity of the birth plan, served as a risk factor for PPD symptomatology. Conclusions: Understanding the conditions under which specific prenatal maternal expectations serve as a risk factor for PPD, can help healthcare providers identify women who are at high risk for developing PPD symptoms and plan preemptive interventions.

        <ab>Maternal pre- and post-delivery stress levels might be different for vaginal or cesarean deliveries. This study aimed to investigate the effects of type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) and time of delivery (pre- and post-delivery) on the stress axes of the body, namely the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) and autonomic nervous system (ANS). Ninety-one pregnant women were volunteered to participate this prospective study. In these women, pre- and post-delivery HPA and ANS activities were measured noninvasively by salivary cortisol and heart rate variability (HRV), respectively. HRV was measured by 5-min electrocardiogram recording and time- and frequency-domain parameters were computed. Salivary cortisol concentration and HRV parameters were higher in women having vaginal delivery than those having cesarean delivery (p &lt; 0.05). Cortisol levels did not differ between pre- and post-delivery (p &gt; 0.05) but the time-domain parameters of HRV decreased post-delivery (p &lt; 0.05). No interactions were observed between the types and times of delivery (p &gt; 0.05). HPA and ANS axes had different activity patterns throughout the delivery process and they were higher during vaginal delivery, suggesting that they are integral parts of normal birth process and that cesarean delivery perturbs the activity of both axes.

        <ab>The aim of the present study was to perform a meta‐analysis of published data to determine the significance of clinical factors and exposures to the risk of perinatal arterial ischaemic stroke (PAIS) and provide guidance for clinical diagnosis and treatment. A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases for relevant observational studies (cohort/case−control) from March 1984 to March 2016 was undertaken. Two review authors independently examined the full text records to determine which studies met the inclusion criteria and evaluated risk factors for PAIS. Risk ratios, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. A total of 11 studies were included in the analyses. Intrapartum fever &gt; 38°C, pre‐eclampsia, oligohydramnios, primiparity, forceps delivery, vacuum delivery, fetal heart rate abnormalities, abnormal cardiotocography tracing, cord abnormalities, birth asphyxia, emergency caesarean section, tight nuchal cord, meconium‐stained amniotic fluid, umbilical arterial pH &lt; 7.10, Apgar score at 5 min &lt; 7, resuscitation at birth, hypoglycaemia, male gender and small for gestational age were identified as risk factors for PAIS. This systemic review and meta‐analysis provides a preliminary evidence‐based assessment of the risk factors for PAIS. Patients with any of the risk factors identified in this analysis should be given careful consideration to ensure the prevention of PAIS. Future studies focusing on the combined effects of multiple prenatal, perinatal and neonatal risk factors for PAIS are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been increasing steadily in Egypt and worldwide. Detecting risk factors for ASD could help initiate screening and risk prevention approaches. Herein, this study aimed to detect several maternal and neonatal risk factors for ASD in Egypt. Methods: In this case-control study, mothers of children with ASD who were visiting Beni-Suef University Hospital in Egypt (n = 268) were compared to mothers of children without ASD attending one primary school with a kindergarten (n = 504) regarding their preconception, conception, and postconception characteristics. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to investigate the possible associations between the collected data and the odds of ASD. Results: In the multivariable-adjusted models, urban residence: OR (95% CI) = 2.33 (1.60–3.38), relative father: 2.63 (1.74–3.96), history of diabetes: 5.98 (1.99–17.97), previous abortion: 2.47 (1.20–13.38), assisted fertility: 4.01 (1.20–13.38), family history of ASD: 7.24 (2.00– 26.24), multiple pregnancy: 11.60 (2.54–53.07), exposure to passive smoking during pregnancy: 2.95 (1.86–4.68), vaginal bleeding during pregnancy: 3.10 (1.44–6.67), hypertension with pregnancy: 3.64 (1.06–12.51), preterm labor: 2.64 (1.26–5.57), neonatal convulsions: 14.88 (5.01–44.20), and admission to neonatal intensive care unit 2.13: (1.21–3.74) were associated with the increased odds of ASD. On the other hand, the intake of vitamins during pregnancy: 0.09 (0.06–0.16) and C-section: 0.44 (0.27–0.70) were associated with the decreased odds of ASD. Conclusion: This study detected several maternal and neonatal risk factors for ASD in Egyptian children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>ObjectivesWhile some medical indications for cesarean delivery are clear, subjective provider and patient factors contribute to the rising cesarean delivery rates and marked disparities between racial/ethnic groups. We aimed to determine the association between language preference and risk of primary cesarean delivery.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) deliveries of patients over 18 years old from 2011–2016 at an academic medical center, supplemented with data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. We used modified Poisson regression with robust error variance to calculate risk ratios for cesarean delivery between patients with English language preference and other language preference, with secondary outcomes of Apgar score, maternal readmission, blood transfusion, and NICU admission.ResultsOf the 11,298 patients included, 10.3% reported a preferred language other than English, including Mandarin and Cantonese (61.7%), Portuguese (9.7%), and Spanish (7.5%). The adjusted risk ratio for cesarean delivery among patients with a language preference other than English was 0.85 (95% CI 0.72–0.997; p = 0.046) compared to patients with English language preference. No significant differences in risk of secondary outcomes between English and other language preference were found.DiscussionAfter adjusting for confounders, this analysis demonstrates a decreased risk of cesarean delivery among women who do not have an English language preference at one institution. This disparity in cesarean delivery rates in an NTSV population warrants future research, raising the question of what clinical and social factors may be contributing to these lower cesarean delivery rates.

        <ab>Our study evaluated factors associated with ill-health in a population-based longitudinal study of women who delivered a singleton live-born baby in a 3-month period across Jamaica. Socio-demographics, perception of health, chronic illnesses, frequency and reasons for hospital admission were assessed. Relationships between ill-health and maternal characteristics were estimated using log-normal regression analysis. Of 9,742 women interviewed at birth, 1,311 were assessed at four stages, 27.7% of whom reported ill-health at least once. Hospitalization rates were 20.9% during pregnancy, 6.1% up to 12 months and 0.5% up to 22 months after childbirth. Ill-health, reported by 11% of women, was less likely with better education (RR = 0.62, 95%; 0.42-0.84). Hospital admission was associated with higher socio-economic status (RR = 1.33, 95% 1.04-1.70) and Caesarean section [CS] (RR = 1.57, 95%; 1.21-2.04). One in three (33.7%) women reported chronic illnesses, and the likelihood increased with age, parity and delivery by elective CS (RR = 1.44, 95%; 1.20-1.73). In multivariable analyses, ill-health was more likely with chronic illness (RR = 2.06, 95%; CI: 1.71-2.48) and hospital admission from 12 to 22 months after childbirth (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.12-2.12). Ill-health during pregnancy and after childbirth represent a significant burden of disease and requires a standardised comprehensive approach to measuring and addressing this disease burden.

        <ab>Aim and objective: To describe factors associated with father involvement in the neonatal intensive care unit using the Heuristic model of the dynamic of parental behaviour and influence on children over time. Background: Research shows that infants with involved fathers have better cognitive development, fewer crying episodes after caesarean birth, improved breastfeeding exclusivity and duration, and more regular sleep patterns. Preterm infants with involved fathers have improved cognitive development. Design: This cross‐sectional exploratory study used survey methodology to explore factors associated with father involvement in the neonatal intensive care unit. Methods: The STROBE checklist for cross‐sectional studies was used (see Appendix S2). Biological fathers of infants in a 97‐bed neonatal intensive care unit in the southern USA completed a survey which asked about their involvement with their hospitalised infants and factors which affected that involvement. Eighty fathers completed the survey. Results: Age ranged between 20–53 with 43% first‐time fathers. Compared to less involved fathers, fathers who were more involved were younger, married or living with the mother, performed kangaroo care or fathers of multiple gestation. Fathers who had attended the delivery were more likely to bathe their infants than those who had not attended the delivery and fathers who performed kangaroo care felt more confident than those who did not. Compared to fathers who visited less often, fathers who visited more often were younger, had infants with a shorter hospitalisation time and lower acuity, and had fewer children in the family. Conclusions: Fathers are involved with their neonatal intensive care unit infants in many ways. Factors were identified that affect involvement in the neonatal intensive care unit. Relevance to clinical practice: Results can help nurses in neonatal intensive care units worldwide facilitate father–infant interaction, identify fathers at risk for decreased involvement and advocate for institutional policy development for supporting neonatal intensive care unit father involvement.

        <ab>IntroductionFood inadequacies in the first 6 months of life are considered a global problem, with an emphasis on early complementary feeding introduction (CFI). This study aimed to identify the determinants of CFI.MethodsA birth cohort study (N = 641). Data on infant feeding was collected before 30 days, and at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and, at baseline, data regarding socioeconomic status, demographics, maternal and infant health, obstetric history, and infant care. The hypothesis was that the risk determinants for early CFI vary according to the type of food and the age range of this introduction. Twelve Cox regression models were fit with four outcomes (formula; other types of milk; other beverages; and solid/semi-solid foods) considering three different age ranges of the infant at their introduction (&lt; 2 months, 2–4 months, and 4–6 months).ResultsThe introduction of the four food groups analyzed was early (median ages of introduction: formulas = 45 days; other milks = 135 days; other beverages = 120 days; solids and semi-solids = 135 days). The determinants that increased the risk of introducing formulas before 2 months were: primiparity, employed without maternity leave, mothers with unsatisfactory prenatal counseling and those who had cesarean sections. Not living with a partner, infant pacifier use at 2 months of age had a higher risk of introducing formula between 2 and 4 months of age. Non-white skin color, more than 35 years old, low maternal education, and lower family income increased the risk of introducing other types of milk between 2 and 4 months of age. Between 4 and 6 months of age, adolescent and low education level mothers had a higher risk of introducing other types of milk, unemployed was a protective factor against the introduction of other foods and beverages in this age group.ConclusionsThe determinants of early CFI varied according to the type of food and the age of introduction.

        <ab>Background Women with one previous caesarean section must decide which mode of delivery they would prefer in their next pregnancy. This involves a choice between attempted vaginal birth and elective caesarean section. Objective To explore women’s mode of delivery preferences and the values placed on the outcomes of decision making. Greater insight into these issues could benefit both clinical care and future research. Design Observational study using longitudinal data collected within a randomized controlled trial. Setting and Participants Seven hundred and forty‐two women with one previous caesarean section recruited at four antenatal clinics in South West England and Scotland. Main outcome measures Mode of delivery preference recorded at 19 and 37 weeks’ gestation and visual analogue scale ratings of health and delivery outcomes. Results Comparison of mid and late pregnancy preferences and actual mode of delivery shows that 57% of women hold the same mode of delivery preferences at both times and 65% of women actually have the birth they prefer. The visual analogue scale ratings show variation in the way women value the outcomes of the decision. Discussion and Conclusions Understanding the way women’s mode of delivery preferences change, how these relate to actual mode of delivery and how women value the outcomes of their decision will be beneficial to health professionals who wish to support women both during pregnancy and after birth. In addition, the visual analogue scale ratings provide evidence that may improve the development of population‐level and economic models of decision making.

        <ab>Objective: to analyze incidents reported in a neonatal care unit. Method: a quantitative, cross-sectional and retrospective study with a sample of 34 newborns. Data were collected through a structured form, composed of two parts: sociodemographic/clinical characteristics of the newborns, and characteristics of the reported incidents. Data were collected from the institution’s computer system, in a period corresponding to 13 months, and analyzed by means of descriptive statistics. Results: the majority of the newborns were preterm (70.6%), male (52.9%) and born through caesarean section (76.5%). During the study period, 54 incidents were reported, totaling a frequency of 1.6 incident per newborn. It was found that 61.1% of incidents were related to medicines, 14.8% to accidental loss of tracheal tube and 9.3% to catheter obstruction. Conclusion: analysis of the reported incidents has shown that most incidents refer to the drug process. Information about the incidents can increase the perception of health professionals regarding the impact of their actions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>This study aimed to assess fear of childbirth (FOB) among Hungarian pregnant women and determine predictors based on WDEQ-A subscales. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 healthy pregnant women during their third trimester. A socio-demographic and obstetrics characteristics, the Hungarian version of WDEQ-A, Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form and Beck Anxiety Inventory were used. The analysis was performed using multivariate linear regression. Among four WDEQ-A subscales, Fear (19%) and Lack of positive emotion (13%) obtained the largest and smallest percentages of cases with severe FOB. The nulliparous obtained significantly higher mean score in subscales Isolation and Lack of positive emotion compared to the multiparous. Anxiety was the most common predictor for all subscales in both groups. In the nulliparous group, significant predictors included economic hardship for Moment of birth, being a housewife for Fear, and wanted pregnancy for Lack of positive emotion. In the multiparous women, the strongest significant predictors were being married, previous elective caesarean section and being a housewife for subscales Isolation, Moment of birth, and Fear, respectively. Assessing FOB using WDEQ-A among Hungarian women revealed different mean scores and predisposing factors for each subscale. The topic should be further explored relative to its constituent factors.

        <ab>Epidemiological studies report conflicting findings regarding association between maternal immigration status and pregnancy outcomes. In this study we compared risk factors and prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in native Portuguese and migrants. Cross-sectional analysis was conducted using information collected at delivery from the participants of Generation XXI birth cohort. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the association between migrant status and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Prevalence of risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes varied between native Portuguese and migrants: teenage mothers (5.6 and 2.0%), primiparae (57.1 and 63.9%), smoking during pregnancy (23.0 and 19.1%), twins (3.2 and 8.0%), and caesarean section (35.2 and 45.7%). Among singleton births, prevalence of low birthweight, preterm birth and small for gestational age were 7.3 and 3.9%, 7.5 and 6.2%, and 15.1 and 7.6%, respectively for native Portuguese and migrants. The native Portuguese had an adjusted significantly higher risk of low birthweight (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.30, 5.48) and small for gestational age (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.26, 3.21), but a similar risk for preterm birth (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.81, 2, 34). Migrant mothers presented a lower risk of low birthweight and small for gestation and data suggest a healthy immigrant effect. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective/Background: Our primary objective was to describe and identify predictors of any and predominant bed-sharing at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum among Chinese-Canadian mothers. Participants: We conducted a longitudinal study of 570 Chinese immigrant and Canadian-born women in Toronto, Ontario. Methods: Any bed-sharing, defined as sharing a bed or mattress for any part of the night on any night in the previous week, and predominant bed-sharing, defined as sharing a bed or mattress for most of the night, on more than half the nights of the previous week, were evaluated at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum. Predictors of bed-sharing, evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models, were background (age, parity, education, household size, delivery mode, social support), cultural (immigrant status, acculturative stress, acculturation, postpartum ritual uptake), and postpartum variables (mental health, breastfeeding problems, fatigue, sleep knowledge, plans for bed-sharing, perceptions of infant sleep problems, cognitions about infant sleep). Results: One in five women (20.7%) reported bed-sharing as the predominant sleep location for their infant at 4 weeks postpartum, with nearly half (45.6%) reporting any bed-sharing at this time. The prevalence of any bed-sharing remained relatively stable at 12 weeks postpartum (46.5%), while predominant bed-sharing increased to 30.1%. The most consistent predictors of any and predominant bed-sharing at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum were lower education level, greater acculturative stress, and predelivery plans to bed-share. Conclusions: These findings have implications for the development of clinical recommendations given to expectant and new parents to promote infant sleep practices that are consistent with American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations.

        <ab>Background: Natural disasters are unpredictable and uncontrollable events that usually induce significant level of stress and social disruption in afflicted individuals. The consequences are formidable, affecting lifetime health and economic prosperity. Among natural disasters, floods are the most common causes and tend to have the highest economic burden. The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with child resilience in the face of the natural disaster experienced by the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada during its unprecedented flood of 2013. Methods: The current study was conducted in a community-based cohort situated in the city of Calgary. The participants were recruited out of the All Our Families longitudinal cohort within the Cummings School of Medicine at the University of Calgary. Of the total 1711 people contacted, 469 people consented and completed questionnaire. Of those 469 who consented to be part of the study, 467 were eligible to be included for analysis. A flood impact questionnaire was delivered 6 months after the 2013 flood in families whose children were an average of 3 years old. Mother reported questionnaires were used to assess child resilience. The study included maternal data on a range of factors including socio-demographic, history of mental health, relationship with the partner and social support. Child related data were also incorporated into the study, and variables included delivery mode, child sex, and child age at the time of disaster. Results: Child resilience was best predicted by mother’s age and social support, and by child gender, the child’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors and the Rothbart temperament scale: effortful control. Furthermore, this study revealed that children who were more exposed to the flood events, showed higher resilience compared to the children who were less or not exposed. Conclusions: These findings highlight the risk and protective factors that predict child resilience and suggest that mother reported questionnaire are useful tools to assess child resilience amidst early life adversity.

        <ab>The objective is to identify obstetric and perinatal factors that could be significant predictors of ASD and may lead to early detection and intervention. A population-based case–control study including 128 children diagnosed with ASD and 311 controls was conducted. Information was collected through self-reported questionnaires. The factors retained as significant predictors for ASD in the final adjusted hierarchical logistic regression model were cesarean section and male gender. The study revealed a higher incidence of cesarean sections and male gender in children with ASD in comparison to unaffected children confirming the results of previous studies. Children born by cesarean section, especially males, should be more closely monitored for the presence of ASD traits for early diagnosis and intervention.

        <ab>Caesarean-section (CS) delivery increases risk of childhood obesity, and is associated with a distinct early-life gut microbiome, which may contribute to obesity. Household pets may alter human gut microbiome composition. We examined if pet-keeping modified the association of CS with obesity at age 2 years in 639 Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study birth cohort participants. Pet-keeping was defined as having a dog or cat (indoors ≥1 h/day) at child age 2 years. We used logistic regression to test for an interaction between CS and pet-keeping with obesity (BMI ≥ 95th percentile) at age 2 years, adjusted for maternal obesity. A total of 328 (51.3 %) children were male; 367 (57.4 %) were African American; 228 (35.7 %) were born by CS; and 55 (8.6 %) were obese. After adjusting for maternal obesity, CS-born children had a non-significant (P = 0.25) but elevated 1.4 (95 % CI 0.8, 2.5) higher odds of obesity compared to those born vaginally. There was evidence of effect modification between current pet-keeping and delivery mode with obesity at age 2 years (interaction P = 0.054). Compared to children born vaginally without a pet currently in the home, children born via CS without a pet currently in the home had a statistically significant (P = 0.043) higher odds (odds ratio 2.00; 95 % CI 1.02, 3.93) of being obese at age 2 years. Pets modified the CS–BMI relationship; whether the underlying mechanism is through effects on environmental or gut microbiome requires specific investigation.

        <ab>Purpose: To determine the effect of the COVID‐19 pandemic on antenatal depression in Turkish pregnant women. Design and Methods: In this cross‐sectional study, data were collected from 497 pregnant women between May and July 2020 using the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) to determine the effect of obstetrics history, fear of hospitalization, concerns about the pandemic, birth, and the health of both mother and infant, on antenatal depression during the COVID‐ 19 outbreak in Turkey. Findings: The general EDS mean score of the total group was determined as mean 13.70 ± 6.22, which was higher than the critical cutoff point of 13. According to the multiple linear regression model applied in the study, the best predictive variables for the mean EDS score were determined to be concerned about completing a healthy pregnancy (r = −0.45), social media and news programs related to COVID‐19 increasing levels of concern (r = −0.31), fear of hospitalization as the birth approaches (r = −0.45), having bad dreams during the COVID‐19 pandemic (r = −0.41), the request for an elective cesarean delivery because of fear of catching COVID‐19 (r = −0.40), fear of breastfeeding the infant (r = −0.45), and concerns that their own health would be negatively affected because of the pandemic (r = − 0.39), and these variables affected the mean EDS score negatively (total variance 40.5%, R = 0.642). Practical Implications: The COVID‐19 pandemic has created an urgent need to implement specific antenatal programs to promote the psychological health of pregnant women and reduce antenatal depression during this or similar crises.

        <ab>Background: The accepted rate rate of caesarean section is 15%. It is expected that an increase in the density of midwives in the family physician program lead to a decrease in this indicator. This study aimed to compare the rates of caesarean section and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery before and after the implementation of the family physician program in health centres with and without an increase in midwives density. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, using multistage cluster sampling method a total of 668 mothers with two-month-old children were selected from among all mothers with two-month-old children who were living in rural areas of Kurdistan province. Using the difference-in-differences model and Matchit statistical model, the factors associated with caesarean section rates and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery were compared in centres with and without an increase in midwives density after the implementation of the family physician program. To compare the changes before and after the program, we used the data collected from the same number of women in 2005 as the baseline. Results: After adjusting for baseline data collected in 2005, the results showed no significant change in caesarean section rates and women's awareness and preference for mode of delivery in the centres with and without an increase in midwives density after the implementation of the family physician program. The Matchit model showed a significant mean increase 14%(0.03–0.25) in women’s awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth between 2005 and 2013 in health centres where the density of midwives increased compared with health centres where it did not. The difference-in-differences model showed that the odds ratio of women’s preference for caesarean section decreased by 41% among participants who were aware of the benefits of natural childbirth, (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: (0.22–0.85); P &gt; 0.001). Conclusions: The results of this study showed that an increase in the density of midwives in the family physician program led to an increase in women's awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth. An increase in women’s awareness of the benefits of natural childbirth was associated with a decreased preference for caesarean section, however this reduction did not have a significant impact on caesarean section rates; possibly, this finding might be attributed to the complexity of this problem that needs a mixed strategy involving various stockholders.

        <ab>Background: Previous studies on the treatment of women with fear of childbirth have focused on the delivery mode. Women with fear of childbirth often suffer from anxiety and/or depression, and treatment therefore also needs to target postnatal psychological well-being and the early mother–infant relationship. Methods: Three hundred and seventy-one nulliparous women out of 4575 scored ≥ 100 in prospective screening (Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire, W-DEQ-A), indicating severe fear of childbirth. These women were randomised to psychoeducative group intervention with relaxation (n = 131; six sessions during pregnancy, one postnatal) or to conventional care (n = 240) by community nurses (referral if necessary). Psycho-emotional and psychosocial evaluations [Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), social support, Maternal Adjustment and Attitudes (MAMA), Traumatic Events Scale (TES) and the Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ-B)] were completed twice during pregnancy and/or 3 months postpartum. Results: Postnatal maternal adjustment (MAMA mean score 38.1 ± 4.3 versus 35.7 ± 5.0, p = 0.001) and childbirth experience (mean W-DEQ-B sum score 63.0 ± 29 versus 73.7 ± 32, p = 0.008) were better in the intervention group compared with controls. In hierarchical regression, social support, participating in intervention, and less fearful childbirth experience predicted better maternal adjustment. The level of postnatal depressive symptoms was significantly lower in the intervention group (mean sum score 6.4 ± 5.4 versus 8.0 ± 5.9 p = 0.04). There were no differences in the frequency of post-traumatic stress symptoms between the groups. Conclusions: In nulliparous women with severe fear of childbirth, participation in a targeted psychoeducative group resulted in better maternal adjustment, a less fearful childbirth experience and fewer postnatal depressive symptoms, compared with conventional care.

        <ab>Background: To determine whether the mode of delivery was different between women who attended childbirth education (CBE) class, had a birth plan, or both compared with those who did not attend CBE class or have a birth plan. Methods: This is a retrospective cross‐sectional study of women who delivered singleton gestations &gt; 24 weeks at our institution between August 2011 and June 2014. Based on a self‐report at the time of admission for labor, women were stratified into four categories: those who attended a CBE class, those with a birth plan, both, and those with neither CBE or birth plan. The primary outcome was the mode of delivery. Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusting for clinical covariates were performed. Results: In this study, 14,630 deliveries met the inclusion criteria: 31.9 percent of the women attended CBE class, 12.0 percent had a birth plan, and 8.8 percent had both. Women who attended CBE or had a birth plan were older (p &lt; 0.001), more likely to be nulliparous (p &lt; 0.001), had a lower body mass index (p &lt; 0.001), and were less likely to be African‐American (p &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for significant covariates, women who participated in either option or both had higher odds of a vaginal delivery (CBE: OR 1.26 [95% CI 1.15–1.39]; birth plan: OR 1.98 [95% CI 1.56–2.51]; and both: OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.46–1.95]) compared with controls. Conclusion: Attending CBE class and/or having a birth plan were associated with a vaginal delivery. These findings suggest that patient education and birth preparation may influence the mode of delivery. CBE and birth plans could be used as quality improvement tools to potentially decrease cesarean rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine correlates of shared decision making during labor and delivery. Methods: Data were from a cohort of women who gave birth to their first baby in Pennsylvania, 2009–2011 (N = 3006). We used logistic regression models to examine the association between labor induction and mode of delivery in relation to women’s perceptions of shared decision making, and to investigate race/ethnicity and SES as potential moderators. Results: Women who were Black and who did not have a college degree or private insurance were less likely to report high shared decision making, as well as women who underwent labor induction, instrumental vaginal or cesarean delivery. Models with interaction terms showed that the reduction in odds of shared decision making associated with cesarean delivery was greater for Black women than for White women. Conclusions: Women in marginalized social groups were less likely to report shared decision making during birth and Black women who delivered by cesarean had particularly low odds of shared decision making. Practice implications: Strategies designed to improve the quality of patient-provider communication, information sharing, and shared decision making must be attentive to the needs of vulnerable groups to ensure that such interventions reduce rather than widen disparities.

        <ab>Background: Cesarean rates in Brazil have reached over 50 percent of all births. Multiple factors have been studied aiming to explain these rates. Mode of delivery preferences among university students may provide insights into strategies to reduce those numbers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted enrolling students who attended Health Sciences and Human Sciences undergraduate programs in 2013. Participants answered a semi-structured questionnaire about which mode of delivery they considered the 'best' (less risky and more beneficial) and the 'preferred' mode (the one they would choose for themselves or their partners). Pearson chi-square was used to assess association among variables. Multiple regression analysis identified independent factors associated with the outcome measures. Results: Among the 797 students who provided complete responses (76% response rate), the mean age was 22.6 years, 61.6 percent were female, 2.6 percent had previous pregnancies, and 56.7 percent were born by cesarean. Vaginal birth was chosen as the 'best' mode of delivery by 91.2 percent, and the 'preferred' mode by 75.5 percent of students. Being male, born vaginally, and a Health Sciences student was associated with a preference for vaginal birth. Being a Health Sciences student and born vaginally was associated with considering vaginal birth the 'best' mode of delivery. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the recognition of the benefits of vaginal birth do not always translate into a personal preference for vaginal birth. The student’s own mode of birth was a strong predictor of their preferences for mode of delivery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aim: In the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland, avoidance of breastfeeding and alternative combinations of antiretroviral therapy regimen and mode of delivery are recommended according to maternal clinical status. The aim of this analysis was to explore the impact of different strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission at a population level. Design: Comprehensive national surveillance study. Methods: Pregnancies in diagnosed HIV-infected women in the UK and Ireland are notified to the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood; infant infection status is subsequently reported. Factors associated with transmission in this observational study were explored for singleton births between 2000 and 2006. Results: The overall mother-to-child transmission rate was 1.2% (61/5151, 95% confidence interval: 0.9-1.5%), and 0.8% (40/4864) for women who received at least 14 days of antiretroviral therapy. Transmission rates following combinations recommended in British guidelines were 0.7% (17/2286) for highly active antiretroviral therapy with planned Caesarean section, 0.7% (4/559) for highly active antiretroviral therapy with planned vaginal delivery, and 0% (0/464) for zidovudine monotherapy with planned Caesarean section (P = 0.150). Longer duration of highly active antiretroviral therapy was associated with reduced transmission after adjusting for viral load, mode of delivery and sex (adjusted odds ratio = 0.90 per week of highly active antiretroviral therapy, P = 0.007). Among 2117 infants born to women on highly active antiretroviral therapy with viral load less than 50 copies/ml, only three (0.1%) were infected, two with evidence of in-utero transmission. Conclusion: Sustained low HIV transmission rates following different combinations of interventions in this large unselected population are encouraging. Current options for treatment and delivery offered to pregnant women according to British guidelines appear to be effective. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Satisfaction with childbirth services is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, providing relevant insights into women’s opinion on quality of services received. Research studies report a dearth of standardised scales that quantify this phenomenon; and none have been tested in India to the best of authors’ knowledge. The current study was undertaken to evaluate psychometric properties of Hindi version of the Turkish Scale for Measuring Maternal Satisfaction: Normal and Caesarean Births versions in order to fill this gap. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in selected public health facilities in Chhattisgarh, India. Healthy women (n = 1004) who gave birth to a single, live neonate, vaginally or via Caesarean section participated. Psychometric assessment was carried out in four steps: 1) scales translated from Turkish to Hindi; 2) Content Validity Index scores calculated for Hindi scales; 3) data collection; 4) statistical analyses for Hindi scales (Normal and Caesarean Birth). A 10-factor model with 36 items emerged for both scales. The Hindi- translated Normal Birth and Caesarean Birth scales had good internal reliability (Cronbach’s α coefficients of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively). The Hindi Scales for Measuring Maternal Satisfaction (Normal and Caesarean Birth) are valid and reliable tools for utilization in Indian health facilities. Their multi-dimensional nature presents an opportunity for the care providers and health administrators to incorporate women’s opinions in intervention to improve quality of childbirth services. Having an international tool validated within India also provides a platform for comparing cross-country findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Importance: Attention is being focused on improving mothers’ positive experiences of childbirth while reducing the negative ones. Cesarean section is a known factor able to increase maternal anxiety. Objective: To determine whether a new binaural beat-based technique can reduce the preoperative discomfort of the elective surgical patient. Methods: Prospective, randomized double-blind controlled study: 60 women scheduled to undergo elective cesarean section. Women with a low risk pregnancy were recruited and enrolled at the time of the '37 weeks' visit. Exclusion criteria were: psychiatric disorders, neurological impairment, epilepsy, deafness, use of drugs/alcohol during pregnancy, insufficient reading level. Participants will be contestually allocated to one of three groups according to a predetermined computer-generated random sequence: (1) 'binaural' group, (2) 'normal music' group, and (3) 'control' group. Participants of groups 1 and 2 will be unaware of the type of audio heard. Intervention: According to the allocation arm, participants were asked to listen an engineered audio track (binaural beat arm) created with the novel algorithm 'Dynamic Spectrum Phase Shift' (DMSPS), or an identical soundtrack without DMSPS in it (music arm), or no specific intervention, representing standard practice. The feeling of anxiety has been measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) questionnaire. Conclusions and Relevance: Binaural beat audio created with DMSPS algorithm provides superior changes in reported anxiety in comparison to normal music and above all to standard care. This technique does not need extra staff or extra staying time for the patients, so it could be a cost-effective way to manage preoperative anxiety in women undergoing elective cesarean section, with a potential impact to the mother’s positive experiences and care of the newborn.

        <ab>Aim: This study explored knowledge, experience and attitudes of health professionals towards early essential newborn care and skin-to-skin contact following Caesarean sections in a tertiary hospital in Central Vietnam. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study using an anonymous questionnaire in March 2016. Health professionals from obstetrics, anaesthesiology and neonatology departments were surveyed. Results: All of the 204 surveys were returned, accounting for 82% of total staff involved in the care for women and newborns with Caesarean sections. Correct knowledge of early essential newborn care was lowest among anaesthesiology staff. Health professionals reported that ≥ 90% of Caesarean section births they attended in the preceding week had skin-to-skin contact. Approximately 16% obstetricians, 71% midwives, 49% anaesthesiology and 76% neonatology staff considered the current frequency of skin-to-skin contact to be about right. The remainder considered the current rate too high. All professional groups identified the main difficulties of conducting skin-to-skin contact as the temperature in the operating theatre and the need for additional staff. Other concerns included increasing the risk of the baby of falling off, prolonging the operation and difficulty to monitor mothers.

        <ab>Studies regarding the association between anxiety disorders and obstetrical and neonatal complications are inconclusive and sometimes contradictive. The aim of the present study was to assess perinatal outcome of mothers with anxiety disorder and to determine the association between maternal anxiety and long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations of the offspring. A hospital-based retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing pregnancy complications and long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations of offspring of mothers with anxiety disorder, during or before the pregnancy and mothers without anxiety. All singleton deliveries between the years 1991 and 2014 in a tertiary medical center were included. To evaluate perinatal outcome of women with anxiety disorders, generalized estimation equation (GEE) models were used to control for confounders. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative incidence of long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations, and a Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to control for confounders. During the study period, 242,038 deliveries met the inclusion criteria, of them 0.1% (n = 304) were mothers with anxiety. Using GEE models, controlling for maternal age, maternal anxiety was noted as an independent risk factor for preterm delivery (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.32–2.69; P &lt; 0.001), hypertensive disorders (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.08–2.69; P = 0.02) and cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.32–2.1; P &lt; 0.001). Offspring born to mothers with anxiety disorders had higher rates of neuropsychiatric-related hospitalizations (6.3 vs 3.1% P = 0.002; Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P &lt; 0.001). Using a Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for confounders such as maternal age, hypertensive disorders, gestational age, birth weight, and cesarean delivery, being born to a mother with anxiety disorders was found to be an independent risk factor for long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations of the offspring (adjusted HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.58–3.89; P &lt; 0.001). Pregnancy of women with anxiety disorders is independently associated with adverse perinatal outcome and higher risk for long-term neuropsychiatric hospitalizations of the offspring.

        <ab>Background: Both preterm delivery and survival rates of very low birth weight (VLBW: &lt;1500 g) infants are increasing. To date, the focus on studies about postpartum mental health after preterm birth has been on depression and on women. There is a paucity of research regarding prevalence, risks, and predictors of postpartum anxiety in parents after VLBW birth. Methods: Parents with VLBW infants and parents with term infants were recruited into the longitudinal HaFEn-study at the three largest centers of perinatal care in Hamburg, Germany. State anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and anxiety and adjustment disorders with a clinical interview one month postpartum. Psychiatric lifetime diagnoses, social support, trait anxiety, stress during birth, socioeconomic status, risks during pregnancy, and mode of delivery were also evaluated. To examine predictors of postpartum state anxiety in both parents simultaneously a multiple random coefficient model was used. Results: 230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. The risk for minor/major anxiety symptoms and adjustment disorders was higher in parents with VLBW infants compared to the term group. The risk for anxiety disorders was not higher in parents with VLBW infants. The most important predictors for postpartum state anxiety were high trait anxiety, the birth of a VLBW infant, high stress during birth, and low social support. Limitations: Data reported here are cross-sectional. Thus, temporal relationships cannot be established. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of early screening for postpartum anxiety in both parents with VLBW infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Cesarean delivery rates continue to increase, and surgery is associated with chronic pain, often co-existing with depression. Also, acute pain in the days after surgery is a strong predictor of chronic pain. Here we tested if mode of delivery or acute pain played a role in persistent pain and depression after childbirth. In this multicenter, prospective, longitudinal cohort study, 1288 women hospitalized for cesarean or vaginal delivery were enrolled. Data were obtained from patient interviews and medical record review within 36 h postpartum, then via telephone interviews 8 weeks later to assess persistent pain and postpartum depressive symptoms. The impact of delivery mode on acute postpartum pain, persistent pain and depressive symptoms and their interrelationships was assessed using regression analysis with propensity adjustment. The prevalence of severe acute pain within 36 h postpartum was 10.9%, while persistent pain and depression at 8 weeks postpartum were 9.8% and 11.2%, respectively. Severity of acute postpartum pain, but not mode of delivery, was independently related to the risk of persistent postpartum pain and depression. Women with severe acute postpartum pain had a 2.5-fold increased risk of persistent pain and a 3.0-fold increased risk of postpartum depression compared to those with mild postpartum pain. In summary, cesarean delivery does not increase the risk of persistent pain and postpartum depression. In contrast, the severity of the acute pain response to childbirth predicts persistent morbidity, suggesting the need to more carefully address pain treatment in the days following childbirth.

        <ab>To examine the relationship between fetal gender and postpartum depression, we conducted a cohort study in Changsha, Hunan, China between September 2004 and January 2005. Women aged 18-40 years with their first live birth of a singleton infant who came to hospital for postpartum examination at 6 weeks after childbirth were invited to participate. Women with known psychiatric disorders or a history of psychiatric disorders were excluded. Data on demographic and clinical information were collected. Postpartum depression was assessed by the Chinese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Fifty-two women (17.3%) were found to have postpartum depression. The rate of postpartum depression in women who gave birth to a female infant was 24.6% while the rate in those women who gave birth to a male infant was 12.2%. The relative risk for postpartum depression of women who gave birth to a female infant as compared with those who gave birth to a male was 2.89, after adjusting for potential confounding by maternal age, education level, family income, living condition, gravidity, number of prenatal care visits, and mode of delivery. We conclude that the risk of postpartum depression is increased in Chinese women who give birth to a female infant as compared to those who gave birth to a male infant. We speculate that this is associated with the negative reactions of family members towards the birth of a female baby. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Early motor skills underpin the more complex and specialized movements required for physical activity. Therefore, the design of interventions that enhance higher levels of early motor skills may encourage subsequent participation in physical activity. To do so, it is necessary to determine the influence of certain factors (some of which appear very early) on early motor skills. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of some very early environmental variables (delivery mode, feeding type during the first 4 months of life) and some biological variables (sex and age in months) on preschool motor skills, considered both globally and specifically. The sample was composed by 43 preschool students aged 5–6 years. The participant's parents completed an adhoc questionnaire, reporting on delivery mode, feeding type, sex, and age in months. The children's motor skills were assessed using observational methodology in the school setting, while the children participated in their regular motor skills sessions. A Nomothetic/Punctual/Multidimensional observational design was used. Results revealed that certain preschool motor skills were specifically influenced by delivery mode, feeding type, sex, and age. Children born by vaginal delivery showed higher scores than children born via C-section in throwing (p = 0.000; d = 0.63); total control of objects (p = 0.004; d = 0.97); total gross motor skills (p = 0.005; d = 0.95); and total motor skills (p = 0.002; d = 1.04). Children who were exclusively breastfed outperformed those who were formula-fed in throwing (p = 0.016; d = 0.75); visual-motor integration (p = 0.005; d = 0.94); total control of objects (p = 0.002; d = 1.02); total gross motor skills (p = 0.023; d = 0.82); and total motor skills (p = 0.042; d = 0.74). Boys outperformed girls in throwing (p = 0.041; d = 0.74) and total control of objects (p = 0.024; d = 0.63); while the opposite occurred in static balance (p = 0.000; d = 1.2); visual-motor coordination (p = 0.020; d = 0.79); and total fine motor skills (p = 0.032; d = 0.72). Older children (aged 69–74 months) obtained higher scores than younger ones (aged 63–68 months) in dynamic balance (p = 0.030; d = 0.66); visual-motor integration (p = 0.034; d = 0.63); and total balance (p = 0.013; d = 0.75). Implications for early childhood care and education are discussed since this is a critical period for motor skill development and learning.

        <ab>Background: Transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive (TGE) people experience pregnancy. Quantitative data about pregnancy intentions and outcomes of TGE people are needed to identify patterns in pregnancy intentions and outcomes and to inform clinicians how best to provide gender-affirming and competent pregnancy care. Aims: We sought to collect data on pregnancy intentions and outcomes among TGE people assigned female or intersex at birth in the United States. Methods: Collaboratively with a study-specific community advisory team, we designed a customizable, online survey to measure sexual and reproductive health experiences among TGE people. Eligible participants included survey respondents who identified as a man or within the umbrella of transgender, nonbinary, or gender-expansive identities; were 18 years or older; able to complete an electronic survey in English; lived in the United States; and were assigned female or intersex at birth. Participants were recruited through The PRIDE Study—a national, online, longitudinal cohort study of sexual and gender minority people—and externally via online social media postings, TGE community e-mail distribution lists, in-person TGE community events, and academic and community conferences. We conducted descriptive analyses of pregnancy-related outcomes and report frequencies overall and by racial and ethnic identity, pregnancy intention, or testosterone use. Results: Out of 1,694 eligible TGE respondents who provided reproductive history data, 210 (12%) had been pregnant. Of these, 115 (55%) had one prior pregnancy, 47 (22%) had two prior pregnancies, and 48 (23%) had three or more prior pregnancies. Of the 433 pregnancies, 169 (39%) resulted in live birth, 142 (33%) miscarried, 92 (21%) ended in abortion, two (0.5%) ended in stillbirth, two (0.5%) had an ectopic pregnancy, and seven (2%) were still pregnant; nineteen pregnancies (4%) had an unknown outcome. Among live births, 39 (23%) were delivered via cesarean section. Across all pregnancies, 233 (54%) were unintended. Fifteen pregnancies occurred after initiation of testosterone, and four pregnancies occurred while taking testosterone. Among all participants, 186 (11%) wanted a future pregnancy, and 275 (16%) were unsure; 182 (11%) felt 'at risk' for an unintended pregnancy. Discussion: TGE people in the United States plan for pregnancy, experience pregnancy (intended and unintended) and all pregnancy outcomes, and are engaged in family building. Sexual and reproductive health clinicians and counselors should avoid assumptions about pregnancy capacity or intentions based on a patient’s presumed or stated gender or engagement with gender-affirming hormone therapy.

        <ab>This was a retrospective case–control study in 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy and 75 women in the control group. Patients completed the questionnaire by Maurovich‐Horvat et al. (J. Sleep Res., 2013, 22: 496–512). We personally interviewed 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy using the administered questionnaire regarding conception, pregnancy, delivery, perinatal and breastfeeding periods. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy reported 59 pregnancies versus 164 in the control group. In 16 cases (27.1%), a disease before pregnancy was present compared with eight cases (4.9%) in the control group (P &lt; 0.001); among them, extrinsic asthma was reported 11 times in the narcolepsy with cataplexy group (P &lt; 0.005). Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy more often had a single pregnancy compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05). Gestational diabetes was more frequent in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (P &lt; 0.05). Induced deliveries were higher in controls (P &lt; 0.009). No differences were found between the groups in terms of duration of pregnancies and complications during and after delivery, as during the puerperium. Neonates from patients had heavier birth weight (P &lt; 0.015). The breastfeeding period was longer in patients (P &lt; 0.01). Modafinil and methylphenidate were the drugs administered in six pregnancies. No significant differences in depression during pregnancy and during puerperium were found between patients and controls. This is the first case–control study in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy related to pregnancy, delivery, childbirth and puerperium. Data suggest that patients have pregnancy outcomes similar to controls. The prevalence of gestational diabetes was higher in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Caesarean sections, complications during delivery and normal perinatal period for infants were similar in both groups. Breastfeeding was longer in patients.

        <ab>Background and Aims: Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is associated with improved outcomes for children exposed to maternal opioid dependence in utero. We examined Ontario's population of pregnant women on MMT and determined the impact of timing of MMT initiation on perinatal outcomes. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Ontario, Canada. Participants: Women eligible for public drug benefits and on MMT during pregnancy between 2005 and 2015. Measurements: We stratified women based on their timing of MMT initiation: (1) stabilized prior to conception, (2) newly initiated prior to conception, (3) initiation in trimester 1, (4) initiation in trimester 2 or (5) initiation in trimester 3. The primary outcomes in the multivariable logistic regression analysis were key perinatal health indicators: small for gestational age, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, severe maternal morbidity, caesarean section and induced labor. Secondary outcomes were specific to maternal opioid dependence: neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), NAS treatment, removal from mother's custody at hospital discharge and neonatal death. Findings: Among 1842 women on MMT during pregnancy, 87.6% (n = 1614) initiated MMT before conception. Almost a quarter of their infants (22.2%; n = 408) were born small for gestational age, 17.5% (n = 323) were preterm and 5.9% (n = 109) were born with a congenital anomaly. The odds of primary outcomes occurring did not differ based on timing of methadone initiation; however, infants of mothers who initiated methadone during pregnancy had up to a fourfold increase in the odds of social services removal at the hospital [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) range = 3.70–4.19] compared with those whose mothers were stabilized on MMT prior to conception. Conclusions: Later initiation of methadone maintenance therapy among pregnant women in Ontario, Canada has not been found to be clearly related to most key perinatal adverse health outcomes.

        <ab>Background: The recommendation of non-indicated caesarean section (CS) after 39 gestational weeks has been announced based on evidence of maternal and infant physiological effects. The potential psychological risks have not been acknowledged. This study aims to investigate emotional and behavioral problems in pre-school children born with elective CS (ECS) on maternal request prior to 39 weeks. Methods: Pregnant women within 12 gestational weeks between November 2008 and October 2010 were invited to participate in the China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS). They were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire respectively in 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy to collect basic maternal characteristics. Pregnant complications and delivery modes were abstracted from medical notes. Their singleton live births were followed up at preschool age. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) were completed by parents to assess children’s emotional and behavioral problems. A total of 3319 mother-child pairs were put into the final analysis. Descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess the impact of delivery modes on abnormalities in SDQ dimensions at various gestational ages. Results: The prevalence of ECS on maternal request prior to 39 weeks, at 39–40 weeks, and after 41 weeks was 16.6, 23.7 and 15.9%, respectively. Compared with those born vaginally, children born with ECS on maternal request were more likely to have total difficult problems (RR 1.519, 95% confidence interval 1.077 to 2.142). ECS on maternal request was the independent predictor of emotional problems (3.479, 1.676 to 7.222) and total difficult problems (2.172, 1.175 to 4.016) in children born prior to 39 gestational weeks. Conclusion: Children delivered by ECS on maternal request have an increased risk to have emotional and behavioral problems prior to 39 gestational weeks at preschool age. The potential psychological implication prior to 39 weeks has been added to the roster of impacts of ECS on maternal request. Further research is needed to probe the potential biological mechanisms.

        <ab>Background: Adverse in-utero and perinatal conditions might contribute to an increased suicide risk throughout the lifespan; however, existing evidence is sparse and contradictory. We aimed to investigate in-utero and perinatal exposures associated with suicide, suicide attempt, and suicidal ideation. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis and searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to Jan 24, 2019, for population-based prospective studies that investigated the association between in-utero and perinatal factors and suicide, suicide attempt, and suicidal ideation. Only papers published in English in peer-reviewed journals were considered. Two researchers independently extracted formal information (eg, country, year, duration of follow-up) and number of cases and non-cases exposed and non-exposed to each risk factor. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs using random-effects models and used meta-regression to investigate heterogeneity. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091205. Findings: We identified 42 eligible studies; they had a low risk of bias (median quality score 9/9 [IQR 8–9]). Family or parental characteristics, such as high birth order (eg, for fourth-born or later-born vs first-born, pooled OR 1·51 [95% CIs 1·21–1·88]), teenage mothers (1·80 [1·52–2·14]), single mothers (1·57 [1·31–1·89]); indices of socioeconomic position, such as low maternal (1·36 [1·28–1·46]) and paternal (1·38 [1·27–1·51]) education; and fetal growth (eg, low birthweight 1·30 [1·09–1·55] and small for gestational age 1·18 [1·00–1·40]) were associated with higher suicide risk. Father's age, low gestational age, obstetric characteristics (eg, caesarean section), and condition or exposure during pregnancy (eg, maternal smoking or hypertensive disease) were not associated with higher suicide risk. Similar patterns of associations were observed for suicide attempt and suicidal ideation; however, these results were based on a lower number of studies. In meta-regression, differences in length of follow-up explained most between-study heterogeneity (inital I 2 ranged from 0 to 79·5). Interpretation: These findings suggest that prenatal and perinatal characteristics are associated with increased suicide risk during the life course, supporting the developmental origin of health and diseases hypothesis for suicide. The low number of studies for some risk factors, especially for suicide attempt and ideation, leaves gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. The mechanisms underlying the reported associations and their causal nature still remain unclear. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>There was limited knowledge on the sexual function in women who have survived severe obstetric complications. The aim of this study was to compare the level of sexual functioning among women with and without severe morbidity at six months postpartum and to identify the factors associated with sexual function scores of women. A prospective double-cohort study design was applied at two tertiary hospitals over a six-month period. Postpartum women with and without severe maternal morbidity were selected as the exposed and the non-exposed group, respectively. The study included 145 exposed and 187 non-exposed women. Those with severe maternal morbidity were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) older (mean (SD): 31.6 years (6.26) vs. 29.2 years (5.65)) and had longer hospital stays (mean (SD): 5.9 days (3.79) vs. 3.6 days (2.23)). They were also more likely to have delivered preterm (75.9 vs. 93.0) and to have had a caesarean section (80.7 vs. 67.9) than those without severe maternal morbidity. After adjusting for age and mental health, there was no significant difference in Female Sexual Function Index scores (P = 0.895) between the two groups. Both groups showed the highest sexual dysfunction in pain and the lowest dysfunction in orgasm. Linear regression analyses showed no association between Female Sexual Function Index scores and sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive history, or quality of life. Sexual function in women with severe maternal morbidity did not differ from that in women without severe maternal morbidity. In-depth qualitative studies of women who have experienced potentially life-threatening conditions may improve the understanding of their sexual function.

        <ab>Objective: To compare maternal and infant outcomes in Hispanic women participating in the Centering Pregnancy Model (CPM) to those receiving prenatal care via the traditional model and determine acceptability of the CPM. Methods: Forty-nine women (n = 24 CPM; n = 25 traditional) participated in this quasi-experimental prospective comparative design. Participants self selected the model of care delivery. Data were collected via questionnaires at the initial visit, 34-36 weeks gestation, and postpartum. Outcome measures included: satisfaction with care delivery model, health behaviors, prenatal/postnatal care knowledge, self-esteem and depression. Breastfeeding initiation and continuation, infant birth weight, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery and infant length of stay were also collected. Results: Traditional participants had a history of more pregnancies, more living children, and higher levels of postpartum self-esteem compared to centering participants. Knowledge deficits and health behaviors were similar between groups. No differences were found for infant outcomes. Conclusions: This study provides information regarding Hispanic mothers' responses to an alternative care delivery model. Preliminary evidence suggests CPM compares with traditional care and yields a high degree of patient satisfaction. Specific pregnancy-related knowledge deficits were identified in both groups that could focus prenatal education. In light of similar outcomes in both groups; patient and provider satisfaction and economics would therefore be a factor when choosing a model of prenatal care delivery.

        <ab>Background: The literature suggests an association between type 2 diabetes mellitus and depression, but data on the association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and postpartum depressive symptomatology (PPDS) are scarce. Methods: Altogether, 1066 women with no previous mental health issues enrolled in the Kuopio Birth Cohort (KuBiCo, www.kubico.fi) were selected for this study. GDM was diagnosed according to the Finnish Current Care Guidelines. Depressive symptomatology was assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during the third trimester of pregnancy and eight weeks after delivery. Additionally, a subgroup of women (n = 505) also completed the EPDS during the first trimester of pregnancy. Results: The prevalence rates of GDM and PPDS in the whole study population were 14.1% and 10.3%, respectively. GDM was associated with an increased likelihood of belonging to the PPDS group (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.23–4.05; adjusted for maternal age at delivery, BMI in the first trimester, smoking before pregnancy, relationship status, nulliparity, delivery by caesarean section, gestational age at delivery, neonatal intensive care unit admission and third-trimester EPDS scores). A significant association between GDM and PPDS was found in the subgroup of women with available data on first-trimester depression (n = 505). Limitations: The participation rate of the KuBiCo study was relatively low (37%). Conclusions: Women with GDM may be at increased risk of PPDS. Future studies should investigate whether these women would benefit from a closer follow-up and possible supportive interventions during pregnancy and the postpartum period to avoid PPDS.

        <ab>Objectives To describe the consequences in terms of health outcomes, care and associated healthcare costs for three hypothetical cohorts of women planning their first pregnancy at a fixed, different age. Design Decision model based on data from perinatal registries and the literature. Setting The Netherlands. Population 3 hypothetical cohorts of 100 000 women aged 23, 29 and 36 years, planning a first pregnancy. Main outcome measures Live birth, pregnancy complications for mother and child and associated healthcare costs. Results For the three cohorts of 23-, 29- and 36-yearold women, 1.6%, 4.6% and 14% of women would not succeed in an ongoing pregnancy (spontaneous or after assisted reproductive technology). The cohort aged 36 gave 9% more miscarriages, 8% more fertility treatment and 1.4% more multiple births than the cohort aged 29. The proportion of caesarean sections among low risk women was 4.9% and 11% higher respectively for the cohorts aged 29 and 36, compared with the cohort aged 23 at start. Eventually, 98%, 95% and 85% of the women in each of the three cohorts gave live birth. The costs for the two older cohorts were €415 and €1662 higher per ongoing pregnancy than the cohort aged 23 years. Conclusions Spontaneous conception and mode of delivery are most susceptible to increasing maternal age leading to involuntary childlessness and non-spontaneous labour. The increase in assisted reproduction technology, twin pregnancies and delivery complications results in higher costs along with fewer ongoing pregnancies at higher age.

        <ab>ABSTRACT Objective We aimed to understand the maternal experience of breastfeeding onset and how psychological, social and clinical variables as pain during breastfeeding, may interfere with it. Methods A cross-sectional study investigated 395 post-delivery women able to breastfeed from 48 hours to 6 days for unpleasant breastfeeding, maternal stress during pregnancy and postnatal mental state. Social Readjustment Rating Scale evaluated prenatal maternal stress. Perceived Maternal Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale – Parent version, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale evaluated maternal mental state. Results Unpleasant breastfeeding experience showed to be positively related to the longer number of days the pain lasts; late onset of breastfeeding; less search for information about pregnancy and baby care (p &lt; .01); lower catastrophizing behaviour towards infant's stress and C-section delivery (p &lt; .04). Pain levels were positively correlated to longer periods of pain, later onset of antenatal consultations and depression (p &lt; .05). Binary logistic regression pointed to the effects of lower self-efficacy and pain in breastfeeding, higher depression levels, gestational stress, labour adversities and success in breastfeeding. Conclusions The relationship among maternal perceived self-efficacy, anxious and depressive thoughts, catastrophizing behaviours, and unpleasant breastfeeding need to be evaluated to elucidate the best health professional intervention.

        <ab>Rationale: Sleep duration is critical to growth, learning, and immune function development in infancy. Strategies to ensure that national recommendations for sleep duration in infants are met require knowledge of perinatal factors that affect infant sleep. Objectives: To investigate the mechanistic pathways linking maternal education and infant sleep. Methods: An observational study was conducted on 619 infants whose mothers were enrolled at the Edmonton site of the CHILD birth cohort. Infant sleep duration at three months was assessed using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Maternal education was collected via maternal report. Prenatal and postnatal depression scores were obtained from the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Birth records and maternal report were the source of covariate measures. Mediation analysis (PROCESS v3.0) was used to examine the indirect effects of maternal education on infant sleep duration mediated through prenatal depression and birth mode. Measurements and main results: At three months of age, infants slept on average 14.1 h. Lower maternal education and prenatal depression were associated with significantly shorter infant sleep duration. Emergency cesarean section birth was associated with 1-hour shorter sleep duration at three months compared to vaginal birth [without intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis] (β: −0.99 h; 95% CI: −1.51, −0.48). Thirty percent of the effect of lower maternal education on infant total sleep duration was mediated sequentially through prenatal depression and birth mode (Total Indirect Effects: −0.12, 95% CI: −0.22, −0.03, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Prenatal depression and birth mode sequentially mediate the effect of maternal education on infant sleep duration. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Several studies report caesarean section (CS) to be a risk factor for childhood asthma. We used data from a large cohort of 5-year-old twins to examine the relationship between mode of birth delivery and asthma. The extent to which an infant is exposed to maternal vaginal flora may protect against the risk of developing asthma. Therefore, we expect a lower rate of asthma in twins born by vaginal delivery (VD) than those born by CS, and a lower rate of asthma in first-born twins compared to second-born twins by VD. Information on mode of delivery was obtained at the time of birth in a survey completed by the mother shortly after delivery. Information on history of asthma diagnosis by a physician was obtained by parental report when the twins were 5 years old. Complete data were available for 6330 first-born and 5438 second-born twins from birth cohorts 1991–2000. Full term first-born twins born by CS had a significantly higher risk of asthma compared to those born by VD, odds ratio = 1.59 (95% CI = 1.23–2.06). No significant differences were observed between CS and VD first-born twins when gestational age was less than 37 weeks, and no significant differences were observed between CS and VD second-born twins at any gestational age. No differences in asthma prevalence were found between first- and second-born twins both born by VD. CS may increase the risk of asthma to full term infants, however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To ascertain the association between caesarean delivery and breastfeeding practices in China. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Electronic databases of CNKI, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest and Science Direct were searched and screened to identify relevant articles from January 1990 to June 2015. Both fixed and random effect meta-analysis techniques were used to estimate the pooled effect size between caesarean delivery and breastfeeding outcomes at different time points. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also conducted. Results: Forty six studies were eligible for the qualitative synthesis of systematic review; among them, 27 studies were included for the meta-analysis. At the early postpartum period, the odds of exclusive breastfeeding after caesarean section was 47% (pooled OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41, 0.68) lower than that after vaginal delivery. At 4 months postpartum, the odds of breastfeeding was similarly lower (pooled OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.53, 0.71) for caesarean mothers. Substantial heterogeneity among studies was detected for both breastfeeding outcomes. Subgroup analyses stratified by study design, time points of breastfeeding outcomes and definitions of breastfeeding all confirmed the negative association between caesarean section and breastfeeding prevalence. Conclusions: In China, breastfeeding practices were affected adversely by caesarean delivery. Therefore, health policy to improve breastfeeding outcomes should take this into consideration.

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to systematically retrieve, critique and synthesize available evidence regarding the association between negative childbirth experiences and future reproductive decisions. Background: A child’s birth is often a joyous event; however, there is a proportion of women who undergo negative childbirth experiences that have long-term implications on their reproductive decisions. Design: A systematic review of quantitative studies was undertaken using Joanna Briggs Institute’s methods. Review methods: A search was carried out in CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science from January 1996-July 2016. Studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were assessed by two independent reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s Critical Appraisal Tools. Data were extracted under subheadings adapted from the institute’s data extraction forms. Results: Twelve studies, which examined either one or more influences of negative childbirth experiences, were identified. The included studies were either cohort or cross-sectional designs. Five studies observed positive associations between prior negative childbirth experiences and decisions to not have another child, three studies found positive associations between negative childbirth experiences and decisions to delay a subsequent birth and six studies concluded positive associations between negative childbirth experiences and maternal requests for caesarean section in subsequent pregnancies. Conclusion: To receive a holistic understanding on negative childbirth experiences, a suitable definition and validated measuring tools should be used to understand this phenomenon. Future studies or reviews should include a qualitative component and/or the exploration of specific factors such as cultural and regional differences that influence childbirth experiences.

        <ab>Objectives: The main objectives of this study were to assess the effects of cathechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) rs4680 and μ-opioid receptor rs1799971 polymorphisms alone or genotype combinations on chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP), acute pain, and analgesic consumption after elective cesarean delivery in a Chinese cohort. Materials and Methods: Two hundred sixty-six patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery with a Pfannenstiel incision under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. All patients were screened for rs4680 and rs1799971 using a peripheral venous blood sample of DNA. Postoperative pain relief was provided by IV patient-controlled analgesia with sufentanyl and tramadol for 48 hours postoperatively. Postoperative pain scores and analgesic consumption were assessed, and CPSP was evaluated 3 months after surgery in all patients.Results:Twenty-nine patients (29/266; 10.9%) developed CPSP at 3 months after surgery. The risk factors for CPSP included previous cesarean delivery and higher analgesic consumptions at 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively (P = 0.032, 0.015, and 0.008, reapectively). No associations were found between CPSP and a single rs4680 and rs1799971 polymorphism, or their combinations (P &gt; 0.05). In contrast, patients with rs1799971 GG required higher patient-controlled analgesics at 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively compared with those with other genotypes (GG &gt; AG &gt; AA). However, no significant effects of interactions between the 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms on analgesic consumption were observed. Discussion: Our results indicate that cathechol-O-methyl-transferase rs4860 and μ-opioid receptor rs1799971 may not contribute to CPSP development after cesarean delivery. The genotype of rs1799971 affects postcesarean analgesic requirement, while the rs4680 do not. Additional larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on birth satisfaction and perceived health care discrimination during childbirth, and in turn, the influence of these birth experiences on postpartum health. Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional, bilingual web survey of 237 women who gave birth at two hospitals in New York City and assessed patient-reported experience and outcomes following the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the New York region. We ascertained SARS-CoV-2 status at delivery from the electronic medical record using participant-reported name and date of birth. We compared birth experience during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15, 2020–May 11, 2020) to a pre-pandemic response period (January 1, 2020–March 14, 2020). We estimated risk ratios for associations between birth experience and anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress, birth-related PTSD, emergency department visits, timely postpartum visit, and exclusive breastfeeding. Multivariable models adjusted for age, race-ethnicity, insurance, education, parity, BMI, previous experience of maltreatment/abuse and cesarean delivery. Results: Women who gave birth during the peak of the pandemic response, and those that were SARS-CoV-2 positive, Black, and Latina, had lower birth satisfaction and higher perceived health care discrimination. Women with lower birth satisfaction were more likely to report higher postpartum anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms, and lower exclusive breastfeeding. Experiencing one or more incident of health care discrimination was associated with higher levels of postpartum stress and birth-related PTSD. Conclusion: Hospitals and policy-makers should institute measures to safeguard against a negative birth experience during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among birthing people of color.

        <ab>Aim: To evaluate the beliefs held by the public regarding sexual health, pregnancy, and breastfeeding during COVID-19 era. Methods: It was an online cross-sectional survey conducted through the Survey Monkey® platform and after proper ethical approval a self-designed questionnaire was circulated by the snowballing sampling technique through the Whatsapp platform. Results: 1636 people respondent to the survey questionnaire. 63% of the participants mentioned that kissing could spread nCoV-SARS. Unprotected sexual intercourse with the spouse can cause infection spread, was reported by about one-third (35.9%). Nearly one-fifth (22%) thought that unprotected sexual intercourse with unknown partners/persons could not spread the infection. About half (49.7%) of the participants reported COVID-19 infection can be transmitted from mother to the child/fetus during the process of birth or during pregnancy and one-fifth (21.3%) of the participants reported going ahead with the Cesarean section if the mother is suspected of having or is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. About one-fifth feared for risk of birth defects and abortion in case the mother is infected with COVID-19. 28% of the participants reported COVID-19 infection can be transmitted to newborn by breastfeeding. Conclusions: The present study suggests that a significant proportion of people have misinformation about sexual intimacy, pregnancy, and breastfeeding in the ongoing pandemic which needs to be addressed.

        <ab>Objectives: To study the prevalence of chronic perinatal pain among mothers who had infants between the ages of 13–25 months in the State of Kerala, India and to report its correlates in the socio-demographic, obstetric and psychological domains. Methods: A total of 9305 mothers selected by cluster random sampling were assessed cross-sectionally for chronic perinatal pain using a questionnaire by Junior Public Health Nurses (JPHNs). In addition, information regarding socio-demographic profile, obstetric history, infant details and perinatal depression were collected. Results: Of the 8302 (89.3%) valid responses, 552 (6.6%) mothers reported chronic perinatal pain. Among those with pain, 142 (25.6%) reported pain during pregnancy, 314 (56.7%) during postpartum and 96 (17.7%) during both periods. The commonest sites of pain reported were back 280 (51%) and pelvic region 110 (19%). Mothers with chronic perinatal pain were more likely to be younger, less educated, employed and from an urban background. Chronic perinatal pain was associated with obstetric complications, delivery by instrumental/caesarean section, non-exclusive breast feeding and higher maternal depression scores. Conclusion: Chronic pain is common among mothers in India during the perinatal period and greater attention needs to be given for it to be recognised and treated early.

        <ab>Background: The relationship between obstetric variables and postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and its influence on quality of life (QoL), have scarcely been studied. Objective: Determine the prevalence of PTSD at postpartum weeks 4 and 6, and its relation with perinatal variables and quality of life Method: A cross-sectional study with 2990 Spanish puerperal women in Spain. Data were collected on socio-demographic and obstetric variables, and on newborns. An online ad hoc questionnaire was used, including the Perinatal Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Questionnaire (PPQ) and SF-36. The crude and adjusted odds ratios were estimated by binary logistic regression. Results: 10.6% (318) of the women appeared at risk for PTSD symptoms. Factors like having a respected birth plan (aOR: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.34, 0.80), using epidural analgesia (aOR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.44, 0.92) and performing skin-to-skin contact (aOR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.28, 0.50) were protective factors against PTSD, among others. Instrumental birth (aOR: 2.50; 95%CI: 1.70, 3.69) and caesarean section (aOR: 3.79; 95%CI: 2.43, 5.92) were found to be risk factors, among others. The area under the ROC curve in this model was 0.79 (95%CI: 0.76, 0.81). The women with PTSD presented a mean difference for QoL of −13.37 points less than those without PTSD (95%CI: −11.08, −15.65). Conclusions: The women with PTSD symptoms had a worse quality of life at postpartum weeks 4–6. Birth type, analgesia methods and humanising practices, like skin-to-skin contact and using respected birth plans, were related with presence of the postpartum PTSD risk.

        <ab>Background: The Erbil psychiatric hospital is the major governmental psychiatric facility in the governorate of Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region in Iraq, providing services for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients from the city and its surrounding areas. The child and adolescent outpatient clinic in the hospital is for patients younger than 18 years. The objectives of this study were to explore the sociodemographic, pregnancy and birth characteristics, as well as the clinical profiles, of patients who presented to the child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic to statistically estimate the frequency of various psychiatric disorders among the attendees and to test hypotheses of the association of these psychiatric disorders with sociodemographic and birth and pregnancy characteristics as reported by many previous studies but with inconsistent results. Methods: A descriptive consecutive cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2017 to February 2018 in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic in Erbil province of Iraq’s Kurdistan region. The diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) were implemented. Chi-square tests were used to test the hypothesized associations. Results: Of a total of 207 patients, 142 were males and 65 were females, and most lived in low socioeconomic status. Most of the patients’ fathers were school educated, and most mothers were illiterate. Consanguinity was found in 41% of the parents, 26.6% of the patients were born by caesarean section(C/S), 62.8% were nurtured exclusively by breastfeeding in their first six months after birth, 42.5% of them visited faith healers before consulting a psychiatrist, 43% had neurodevelopmental disorders, 26.6% had intellectual disabilities with behavioral and emotional comorbidities and 30.4% had other mental/behavioral disorders. Conclusion: This study revealed that the child and adolescent psychiatric disorders in Erbil city are versatile and that many factors are significantly associated with them. Cultural concepts are still influential in the region in a way that can interfere with children’s well-being, a situation that calls for more concern and attention.

        <ab>Based on a retrospective cohort design with 6-year-old children born in twin births, the relationship between verbal, non-verbal, global neuropsychological development, general intelligence and type of delivery has been studied. To this end, the possible effect of third gestational, obstetric and neonatal variables, such as maternal age at delivery, fetal presentation, gestational age, newborn weight and Apgar at minute one, was controlled. The exposed cohort includes children born by cesarean section, and the unexposed cohort is composed of children born vaginally with or without induction. A total of 124 children were evaluated in their 1st year of primary school using the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire, Kaufman’s Intelligence Test and the medical histories of the children collected after birth. By means of binary logistic regression analysis, it has been found that the type of delivery is presented as an independent risk factor for disorders in verbal, non-verbal and global development and for the general intellectual difficulties of children born of multiple births. These results suggest the need to analyze in future prospective studies with broader samples the relationship between different types of obstetric and perinatal variables of birth type and infant neuropsychological development and general intelligence, in order to prevent possible psychological alterations from birth.

        <ab>This study aimed to examine the association of social support, social factors, and maternal complications with caesarean deliveries in native and immigrant women, and to explore the association between acculturation and caesarean deliveries in immigrant women in Taiwan. This prospective panel study was conducted from August 2012 through April 2014 and included 222 native and 147 immigrant pregnant women in Taiwan. Caesarean rates did not differ significantly between native and immigrant women, including the overall caesarean rate (28.8%, 32.0%), medically indicated caesarean (22.5%, 24.5%), and caesarean without medical indications (6.3%, 7.5%). Results of multiple logistic regression models revealed that maternal complications and household activity support were positively associated with caesarean deliveries. Both native and immigrant women with high levels of informational support were less likely to receive caesareans. Immigrant women who were older than 35 years, had a middle level socioeconomic status, and perceived a high level of acceptance of caesarean in Taiwan were more likely to have caesarean deliveries. Informational support was a protective factor for caesarean delivery, whereas household activity support offered by the family was positively associated with caesarean delivery. Perceived acceptance level in mainstream society could affect immigrant women’s use of caesarean delivery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To describe the prevalence of negative childbirth experiences and to identify potential predictors, including demographic, prenatal, obstetric, and psychological factors, of these experiences among French women. Design: Descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study. Setting: A maternity ward in a hospital located near Paris, France. Participants: A total of 256 women between the ages of 18 and 46 years were recruited while hospitalized in the maternity ward 1 to 6 days after childbirth. Methods: Participants completed a personal information form and five self-report scales: the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, and the Questionnaire Assessing the Childbirth Experience. We performed linear regression analyses and used scores on the Questionnaire Assessing the Childbirth Experience as the dependent variable. We considered prenatal, psychological, and obstetric factors as independent variables and adjusted results for covariates. Results: The prevalence of a negative childbirth experience was 23.3% among our participants. We identified primiparity, high anxiety trait scores, and an anxious attachment style as the prenatal variables that contributed significantly to negative perceptions of childbirth based on the first step of the regression analysis (R² = .18; p &lt; .001). We evaluated objective birth-related variables during the second step and found that mode of birth and use of epidural analgesia were significative predictors of the negative childbirth experience (R² = 0.36; p &lt; .001). The last set of variables included subjective birth-related factors, such as absence of the partner during birth and low perceived sense of control; these variables increased the explained variance from 36% to 69% (p &lt; .001) and showed that these aspects were powerful predictors of a negative childbirth experience. Conclusions: Given that some prenatal factors influence women’s perceptions of their birth experiences, preventive measures can be implemented by health professionals to support women with risk factors. In the early postpartum period, health care professionals should focus on subjective variables of childbirth because they strongly predict the overall childbirth experience for women.

        <ab>ABSTRACT The Ja-Kids Longitudinal Study (JA-Kids) aims to improve the health and development of Jamaican children by identifying social, demographic, environmental and clinical factors that help or hinder these processes. As clinical indicators relied on maternal reporting, we aim to evaluate the quality of the self-reported data. Women were recruited across Jamaica during pregnancy or at delivery from July 1–30 September 2011. Indicators were compared between women recruited while pregnant and at delivery to understand possible differences between the sub-populations. Variables reported more than once between pregnancy and delivery were assessed to evaluate level of agreement (reliability). Clinical indicators from the literature were contrasted with study findings to determine how maternal reporting align with published prevalence (validity). Intra-class correlation and the kappa (κ) statistic were used to assess reliability while chi-squared, Fisher’s-exact or students-t were used to compare differences over time; p values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Women recruited during pregnancy (n = 3970) were younger, less parous and possibly more socially disadvantaged than those recruited at delivery (n = 5803). Socio-demographic and selected clinical indicators showed good to moderate (0.421 &lt; κ &lt; 0.681) reporting consistency between pregnancy and delivery for previous C-section (κ = 0.681), pre-existing diabetes mellitus (κ = 0.616) and prior twin gestations (0.580). Most conditions however showed only fair agreement (0.21 &lt; κ &lt; 0.40) including previous gestational hypertension (κ = 0.387), asthma (κ = 0.365), premature rupture of membranes (κ = 0.324), eclampsia (κ = 0.257) and essential hypertension (κ = 0.213). Infectious conditions had poor reliability. Prevalence rates for most conditions, except sickle cell disease, were lower than the published literature. Complications and outcomes which were well defined for women were better reported than those requiring clinical judgment (e.g. prior C-section versus specific hypertensive disorders of pregnancy). NCDs with only episodic acute effects were not well reported, e.g. asthma, hypertension and sickle cell disease. Maternal reporting of pregnancy complications needs to be interpreted with caution.

        <ab>Background/Objectives: Cesarean section (CS) and antibiotic use during pregnancy may alter normal maternal-offspring microbiota exchange, thereby contributing to aberrant microbial colonization of the infant gut and increased susceptibility to obesity later in life. We hypothesized that (i) maternal use of antibiotics in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and (ii) CS are independently associated with higher risk of childhood obesity in the offspring. Subjects/Methods: Of the 727 mothers enrolled in the Northern Manhattan Mothers and Children Study, we analyzed the 436 mother–child dyads followed until 7 years of age with complete data. We ascertained prenatal antibiotic use by a questionnaire administered late in the third trimester, and delivery mode by medical record. We derived age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z-scores using the CDC SAS Macro, and defined obesity as BMI z ≥ 95th percentile. We used binary regression with robust variance and linear regression models adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, pre-gravid BMI, maternal receipt of public assistance, birth weight, sex, breastfeeding in the first year and gestational antibiotics or delivery mode. Results: Compared with children not exposed to antibiotics during the second or third trimester, those exposed had 84% (33–154%) higher risk of obesity, after multivariable adjustment. Second or third trimester antibiotic exposure was also positively associated with BMI z-scores, waist circumference and % body fat (all P&lt;0.05). Independent of prenatal antibiotic usage, CS was associated with 46% (8–98%) higher offspring risk of childhood obesity. Associations were similar for elective and non-elective CS. Conclusions: In our cohort, CS and exposure to antibiotics in the second or third trimester were associated with higher offspring risk of childhood obesity. Future studies that address the limitations of our study are warranted to determine if prenatal antibiotic use is associated with offspring obesity. Research is also needed to determine if alterations in neonatal gut microbiota underlie the observed associations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Birth outcomes of women with anorexia nervosa are poorly understood. We hypothesized that hospitalization for anorexia nervosa before or during pregnancy is associated with an elevated risk of adverse maternal and infant birth outcomes. Method: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 2,134,945 pregnancies in Quebec, Canada, from 1989 to 2016. The main exposure measure was anorexia nervosa requiring hospital treatment before or during pregnancy. Outcome measures included stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational age birth, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, and other pregnancy disorders. We computed risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between anorexia nervosa and birth outcomes adjusted for maternal characteristics. Results: Compared with no hospitalization, anorexia nervosa hospitalization was associated with 1.99 times the risk of stillbirth (95% CI 1.20–3.30), 1.32 times the risk of preterm birth (95% CI 1.13–1.55), 1.69 times the risk of low birth weight (95% CI 1.44–1.99), and 1.52 times the risk of small-for-gestational age birth (95% CI 1.35–1.72). The associations with low birth weight and small-for-gestational age birth were more prominent in women hospitalized for anorexia nervosa during pregnancy or within 2 years of delivery. Hospitalization for anorexia nervosa was associated with certain maternal outcomes, including precipitate labor, acute liver failure, and admission to an intensive care unit. Discussion: Hospitalization for anorexia nervosa before or during pregnancy is associated with adverse infant and maternal outcomes. Infants are primarily at risk of stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational age birth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though the conditions under which this elevated risk occurs are unclear. Animal literature demonstrates that antibiotic use, which affects the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, modifies the effect of MIA on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. The aim of this study was to assess whether antibiotic use during pregnancy modifies the association between MIA and subsequent risk of ASD, in a prospective birth cohort with 116 ASD cases and 860 typically developing (TD) child controls. There was no evidence of interaction between fever or genitourinary infection and antibiotic use on the odds of ASD in unadjusted or adjusted analyzes. However, we found evidence of an interaction between flu, specifically in second trimester, and antibiotic use at any point during pregnancy on the odds of ASD in the child. Among women who received an antibiotic during pregnancy, flu in trimester two was not associated with ASD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.99 [0.43–2.28]). Among women who were not exposed to an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy, flu in second trimester was significantly associated with increased odds of ASD (aOR = 4.05 [1.14–14.38], P = .03), after adjustment for child sex, child birth year, maternal age, gestational age, C‐section delivery, and low birthweight. These findings should be treated as hypothesis‐generating and suggest that antibiotic use may modify the influence that MIA has on autism risk in the child.

        <ab>We looked at whether the association between activation of the immune system during pregnancy and risk of the child developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differed among women who did or did not take an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy. We examined 116 children with ASD and 860 without ASD and found that flu in second trimester was associated with increased ASD, but only among women who did not take an antibiotic during pregnancy. No other immune activation exposures seemed to interact with antibiotic use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To (i) reveal care-seeking patterns of emergency room visits within 30 days following childbirth (i.e., identify risk factors that trigger contact with emergency room, visit rate and diagnoses) and (ii) suggest clinical implications for postnatal follow-up. Design: The study had a longitudinal design; it used anonymised data from a county council database on all women in Stockholm County, Sweden, who gave birth in 2013. Methods: Descriptive and inferential data analysis methods were used. Cox regression was applied to these variables: age when giving birth, diagnostic codes at birth, care encounters and types (e.g., visits or hospital admissions), day of discharge and care organisation and type. The data covered the period from childbirth through a 30-day period following discharge from hospital. Results: The database contained 28,963 births and 59,202 healthcare or medical care encounters. Of these encounters, 50.3% (n = 29,774) were planned visits to hospital postnatal care units within 7 days following discharge and 1.2% (n = 681) were admissions to hospitals. Of all women who gave birth, 12.2% (n = 3,533) visited the emergency room at least once. The number of visits peaked at day 6 following discharge. These factors significantly increased risk for emergency room visits: caesarean, assisted birth and sphincter injury. Conclusions: Emergency room visits occurred most commonly immediately following discharge when there were no routine check-ups. Greater risk of emergency room visits—following caesareans, assisted childbirths or sphincter injuries—indicated that early support for women with childbirth complications should be improved upon discharge from hospital. Other multiple risk factors for emergency room visits might exist. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Many emergency room visits could be prevented through early, more qualified, appropriate follow-up via maternity care systems and effective midwifery interventions. These initiatives could enhance care continuity and facilitate postpartum recovery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To describe preterm infants’ mothers’ expressing practices and exclusive use of mother’s breast milk in neonatal intensive care settings, as well as to explore whether mothers’ and infants’ characteristics are predictors of the mother’s inadequate expressing practices and nonexclusive use of mothers’ breast milk. Background: Use of their own mother’s milk decreases preterm infants’ mortality and morbidity, but expression is exhausting for the mothers. Mothers’ and infants’ characteristics are associated with milk output and exclusive breastfeeding at discharge, as well as later in infancy. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The data were collected through questionnaires in two neonatal units. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine whether mothers’ and infants’ characteristics are predictors of late expression initiation (&gt;6 hr from birth), inadequate expression frequency (≤6 times per a day) and nonexclusive use of own mother’s milk. Results: The sample consisted of 129 mothers. One-third of the mothers had adequate expression practices. Half of the infants exclusively received their mother’s own breast milk. Previous neonatal intensive care unit experience, poor psychological well-being, an infant’s male gender, caesarean section and high gestational birth age were significant predictors of late expression initiation. None of the studied variables were significant predictors of inadequate expression frequency. Furthermore, lack of previous expression experience, financial woes and high gestational age were predictors of nonexclusive use of own mother’s milk. Conclusions: Expression practices, as well as use of own mother’s milk, were suboptimal. High gestational age was associated with both late expression initiation and nonexclusive breast milk use. The mothers maintained expression regardless of their well-being. Relevance to clinical practice: Counselling and support are needed to avoid suboptimal expression practices. Special attention should be paid to mothers with moderately preterm infants, caesarean delivery, poor psychological well-being and financial woes.

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of peripartum analgesic and psychological factors that may be related to postpartum depression (PPD). Methods: This case–control study was conducted in pregnant females who delivered at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital from November 2010 to October 2013 and had postpartum psychological assessment. Demographic, medical, and postpartum psychological status assessments, intrapartum data including method of induction of labor, mode of labor analgesia, duration of first and second stages of labor, mode of delivery, and pain intensity on hospital admission and after delivery were collected. PPD was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and clinical assessment by the psychiatrist. Results: There were 62 cases of PPD and 417 controls after childbirth within 4–8 weeks. The odds of PPD was significantly lower (33 of 329 [10.0%]) in females who received epidural analgesia for labor compared with those who chose nonepidural analgesia (29 of 150 [19.3%]) ([odds ratio] 0.47 (0.27–0.8), P = 0.0078). The multivariate analysis showed that absence of labor epidural analgesia, increasing age, family history of depression, history of depression, and previous history of PPD were independent risk factors for development of PPD. Conclusion: The absence of labor epidural analgesia remained as an independent risk factor for development of PPD when adjusted for psychiatric predictors of PPD such as history of depression or PPD and family history of depression.

        <ab>Purpose: To determine the association between prenatal exclusive breastfeeding intentions and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and explore other factors associated with EBF until 3 months postpartum among mothers residing in suburban parts of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja Nigeria. Description: This longitudinal observational study involved the recruitment of 210 pregnant women who were prospectively followed until 3 months postpartum. Participants were recruited from antenatal clinics attached to four separate public secondary health facilities located in the suburban parts of Abuja. Cox regression hazards model was used to determine the risk of EBF cessation at 3 months postpartum. Assessment: Over 70.0 % of women had strong intention to exclusively breastfeed. The risk of exclusive breastfeeding cessation was significantly lower in women with strong exclusive breastfeeding intentions (HR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.8–0.95). Other risk factors for cessation of exclusive breastfeeding were pre-lacteal feed administration (HR 2.93 95 % CI 1.49–5.77) and mode of delivery (HR 0.17 95 % CI 0.04–0.67). Higher maternal age (≥ 35 years), religion (Muslim) and having an unplanned pregnancy lowered the likelihood of having a strong intention to exclusively breastfeed an infant. Conclusions: Prenatal exclusive breastfeeding intention was a strong predictor of exclusive breastfeeding. Intentions to EBF were further explained by maternal characteristics. Effective promotion of exclusive breastfeeding during prenatal period should also target factors influencing breastfeeding intentions. Additional research is warranted into the influence of maternal attitudes and self-efficacy about breastfeeding on breastfeeding intentions and practice.

        <ab>Background: The association between cesarean section and the risk of postpartum depressive symptoms remains controversial. The present prebirth cohort study examined this issue in Japan. Methods: Study subjects were 1310 women. Information under study was obtained using a self-administered questionnaire. Postpartum depressive symptoms were defined as a total Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of nine or higher between three and four months postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for age, body mass index, gestational weeks at baseline, gestational weeks at delivery, number of children at baseline, previous miscarriage or stillbirth, previous abortion, history of depression, family history of depression, region of residence, employment status, educational level, household income, family structure, breastfeeding status, smoking during pregnancy, infant's birthweight, and infant's sex. Results: Postpartum depressive symptoms were identified in 8.2%. After adjustment for the confounding factors, compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean section was independently associated with an increased risk of postpartum depressive symptoms: the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16−3.23). This positive association was more apparent among those who had no other children at baseline than among those who already had one or more children: the adjusted ORs were 2.94 (95% CI: 1.35−6.26) and 1.45 (95% CI: 0.68−2.92), respectively; however, this interaction was not significant. Limitations: Information on whether each cesarean section was emergency or elective and other obstetric complications was not available. Conclusions: Cesarean section may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum depressive symptoms, especially among women without children at baseline.

        <ab>Objectives: To identify risk factors associated with urban postpartum emergency department utilization. Methods: This case–control study included 100 matched pairs of postpartum women who had delivered at a large, integrated urban medical system in Bronx, New York, in 2012–2013, with the cases having had an emergency department visit within 42 days of delivery. The cases, identified utilizing administrative and billing data, were matched 1:1 with controls by labor unit, delivery mode and date, excluding nonviable pregnancies. The controls did not have a known postpartum emergency department visit. Variables were abstracted from administrative data and chart review, and included demographics, antenatal/intrapartum/postpartum complications and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Factors associated with puerperal emergency department use were identified via univariate and multivariable analyses. Results: Following conditional logistic regression, primiparity [54% vs. 32%, aOR 5.91, 95% CI 2.34–14.91], public insurance [70% vs. 56%, aOR 4.22, 95% CI 1.60–11.12], weekend delivery [30% vs. 26%, aOR 7.61, 95% CI 1.15–52.43] and delivery-related complications [47% vs. 28%, aOR 2.95, 95% CI 1.16–7.51] were associated with an increased risk of postpartum emergency department use, while women of younger ages (17–24 years old) were less likely to have postpartum emergency department use [aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07–0.74]. Univariate analysis of individual events within the composite variables showed an association between gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and postpartum emergency department use [28% vs. 13% OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.26–5.39]. Psychiatric history, social instability, preterm delivery/neonatal intensive care unit admission, pre-existing medical/antepartum conditions and prolonged postpartum stay were not associated. Conclusions for Practice: Delivery-related complications, delivery timing, and certain sociodemographic factors are identifiable risk factors for increased postpartum emergency department utilization. These may be targeted for development of interventions improving puerperal care and potentially preventing emergency department visits, which are costly to the health system and disruptive to the lives of women and their families.

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 40(3) of Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care (see record [rid]2013-34722-010[/rid]). The title of this paper was incorrect. The correct title should read as follows: Effect of mode of birth on maternal and newborn outcome remains controversial.] Comments on an article, 'Maternal and infant outcome after caesarean section without recorded medical indication: Findings from a Swedish case-control study' by A. Karlström, H. Lindgren and I. Hildingsson (2013). This study is one of a series of recent publications that attempt to sort out the impact of mode of birth on maternal and newborn outcome. The focus on elective cesarean section compared to planned vaginal birth beginning in spontaneous labor is an improved methodology over the earlier comparisons that failed to be able to separate planned from unplanned cesarean section or vaginal birth. The retrospective case control methodology based on birth record data that is employed in this research is similar to others, though with more respectable numbers. Most suffer from the problem of ascertainment difficulties, failure to stratify by parity, and of course, the unavailability of randomization, which some consider the ideal methodology.

        <ab>Introduction: To identify and describe the frequency and characteristics of disrespect and abuse practices towards women during facility-based delivery in four hospitals in two Mexican states in 2017, using a mixed method of direct observation and women’s reports of health care experiences. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed to describe disrespect and abuse practices in obstetric care (interactions or conditions that are experienced as or intended to be humiliating or undignified) committed by healthcare providers. We included all pregnant women admitted for childbirth (vaginal and cesarean). Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with women, prior to discharge, regarding their experience at delivery. Results: 867 deliveries were observed. 18.8% of women (n = 163) experienced at least one disrespect and abuse event, especially at secondary care facilities. There were a total of 493 disrespect and abuse events, which, on average, represents three events per woman (39.4% were verbal abuse, 32% were physical abuse, and 28.6% were discrimination). In the majority of cases (&gt; 50%), women did not give consent to not recommended invasive procedures and were not provided with adequate information to those procedures. Conclusions for Practice: Direct observation and interviews was a useful tool to identify disrespectful and abusive practices during delivery care. Our findings provide new evidence of the frequency and characteristics of disrespect and abuse during delivery care in Mexico, which can be used to inform maternal health programs. Additionally, these results encourage the creation of surveillance policies and committees in order to guarantee violence-free and dignified treatment of women during delivery care.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms of SIRT with postpartum depressive symptoms and analyze the risk factors for postpartum depressive symptoms in women following cesarean section. Methods: A total of 368 Chinese woman undergoing cesarean section were enrolled in this study. A cutoff of ≥ 10 for the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale identified postpartum depressive symptoms. Genotypes of SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT6 were determined using Sequenom MassArray single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. We analyzed the contribution of genetic factors (SNPs, linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype) to postpartum depressive symptoms and performed logistic regression analysis to identify all potential risk factors for postpartum depressive symptoms and define interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Results: The incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 18.7% in this cohort. Univariate analysis suggested that SIRT2 polymorphism at rs2873703 (TT genotype) and rs4801933 ((TT genotype) and SIRT6 polymorphism at rs350846 (CC genotype) and rs107251 (TT genotype) were significantly correlated with the occurrence of postpartum depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). Linkage disequilibrium was identified between SIRT6 polymorphisms rs350846 and rs107251. Incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms in cesarean-section parturients with SIRT2 haplotype CCC was decreased (OR 0.407, 95% CI 0.191–0.867; p = 0.016). SIRT2 polymorphisms rs2873703 and rs4801933 were multiply collinear. Logistic regression analysis showed that SIRT2 polymorphism at rs2873703 (TT genotype) and rs4801933 (TT genotype), domestic violence, stress during pregnancy, and depressive prenatal mood were risk factors for postpartum depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Pregnant women with SIRT2 genotypes rs2873703 TT and rs4801933 TT and experiencing domestic violence, stress during pregnancy, and prenatal depression are more likely to suffer from postpartum depressive symptoms.

        <ab>To analyze the influence of maternal personality (big five personality, coping and childbirth expectations) on birth satisfaction. A longitudinal prospective design was used with 116 pregnant women during November 2014-December 2015 at a public hospital (Madrid, Spain) with three assessment stages: first trimester of pregnancy (personality factors), third trimester (childbirth expectations and coping strategies) and 48 hours after childbirth (labor satisfaction). The highest childbirth satisfaction scores were for professional support, support from partner and overall satisfaction. Higher childbirth satisfaction scores were found for vaginal births than for cesarean sections or instrumental births. Childbirth expectation dimensions showed the highest number of associations with childbirth satisfaction. Significant correlations were found between neuroticism and home assessment, agreeableness and environment, and openness to experience and overall satisfaction. Significant positive correlations were found between positive reappraisal and continuity, and negative correlations between avoidance coping and home assessment. Regression analyses showed the predictive role played by the type of birth, and the caregiving environment as childbirth expectation, and positive reappraisal and avoidance as coping strategies. These findings have important implications for health professionals who provide assistance to pregnant women through holistic models which include the assessment and adjustment of childbirth expectations.

        <ab>Child mortality (the mortality of children less than five years old) declined considerably in the developing world in the 1990s, but infant mortality declined less. The reductions in neonatal mortality were not impressive and, as a consequence, there is an increasing percentage of infant deaths in the neonatal period. Any further reduction in child mortality, therefore, requires an understanding of the determinants of neonatal mortality. 209,628 birth and 2581 neonatal death records for the 1998 birth cohort from the city of São Paulo, Brazil, were probabilistically matched. Data were from SINASC and SIM, Information Systems on Live Births and Deaths of Brazil. Logistic regression was used to find the association between neonatal mortality and the following risk factors: birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, delivery mode, plurality, sex, maternal education, maternal age, number of prior losses, prenatal care, race, parity and community development. Infants of older mothers were less likely to die in the neonatal period. Caesarean delivery was not found to be associated with neonatal mortality. Low birth weight, pre-term birth and low Apgar scores were associated with neonatal death. Having a mother who lives in the highest developed community decreased the odds of neonatal death, suggesting that factors not measured in this study are behind such association. This result may also indicate that other factors over and above biological and more proximate factors could affect neonatal death. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Importance: Early-life exposures, such as prenatal maternal lifestyle, illnesses, nutritional deficiencies, toxin levels, and adverse birth events, have long been considered potential risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. However, maternal genetic factors could be confounding the association between early-life exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring, which makes inferring a causal relationship problematic. Objective: To test whether maternal polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for neurodevelopmental disorders were associated with early-life exposures previously linked to the disorders. Deign, Setting, And Participants: In this UK population-based cohort study, 7921 mothers with genotype data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)underwent testing for association of maternal PRS for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD PRS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD PRS), and schizophrenia (SCZ PRS) with 32 early-life exposures. ALSPAC data collection began September 6, 1990, and is ongoing. Data were analyzed for the current study from April 1 to September 1, 2018. Eposures: Maternal ADHD PRS, ASD PRS, and SCZ PRS were calculated using discovery effect size estimates from the largest available genome-wide association study and a significance threshold of P &lt; .05. Main Outcomes And Meaure: Outcomes measured included questionnaire data on maternal lifestyle and behavior (eg, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and maternal age), maternal use of nutritional supplements and medications in pregnancy (eg. acetaminophen, iron, zinc, folic acid, and vitamins), maternal illnesses (eg, diabetes, hypertension, rheumatism, psoriasis, and depression), and perinatal factors (eg, birth weight, preterm birth, and cesarean delivery). Results: Maternal PRSs were available from 7921 mothers (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [4.8] years). The ADHD PRS was associated with multiple prenatal factors, including infections (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18), use of acetaminophen during late pregnancy (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18), lower blood levels of mercury (β coefficient, −0.06; 95% CI, −0.11 to −0.02), and higher blood levels of cadmium (β coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.09). Little evidence of associations between ASD PRS or SCZ PRS and prenatal factors or of association between any of the PRSs and adverse birth events was found. Sensitivity analyses revealed consistent results. Conclusions And Relevance: These findings suggest that maternal risk alleles for neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily ADHD, are associated with some pregnancy-related exposures. These findings highlight the need to carefully account for potential genetic confounding and triangulate evidence from different approaches when assessing the effects of prenatal exposures on neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.

        <ab>Background: Little is known about the relationship between disability and mode of delivery. Prior research has indicated elevated risk of cesarean delivery among women with certain disabilities, but has not examined patterns across multiple types of disability or by parity. Objective: This study sought to determine whether physical, sensory, or intellectual and developmental disabilities are independently associated with primary cesarean delivery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all deliveries in California from 2000 to 2010 using linked birth certificate and hospital discharge data. We identified physical, sensory, and intellectual and developmental disabilities using International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification codes. We used logistic regression to examine the association of these disabilities and primary cesarean delivery, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, and stratified by parity. Results: In our sample, 0.45% of deliveries (20,894/4,610,955) were to women with disabilities. A greater proportion of women with disabilities were nulliparous, had public insurance, and had comorbidities (e.g., gestational diabetes) compared with women without disabilities (p &lt; .001 for all). The proportion of primary cesarean in women with disabilities was twice that in women without disabilities (32.7% vs. 16.3%; p &lt; .001; adjusted odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.94–2.17). The proportion of deliveries by cesarean was highest among women with physical disabilities due to injuries compared with women without disabilities (57.8% vs. 16.3%; p &lt; .001; adjusted odds ratio, 6.83; 95% confidence interval, 5.46–8.53). Conclusions: Women across disability subgroups have higher odds of cesarean delivery, and there is heterogeneity by disability type. More attention is needed to this population to ensure better understanding of care practices that may impact maternal and perinatal outcomes.

        <ab>This study aimed to investigate prospectively the contribution of maternal physical health and/or breastfeeding problems to maternal mood (depression, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, confusion, vigor) at 8-weeks postpartum. A prospective study was conducted. Participants were recruited antenatally from a public and a private maternity hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Nulliparous pregnant women (N = 229), ≥ 18 years of age, ≥ 36-week gestation, singleton pregnancy and with sufficient English were eligible. Data were collected by self-report questionnaire (pregnancy, weeks 1–4 postpartum) and telephone interview (week 8 postpartum). A high burden of physical problems was classified as ≥ 3 problems (caesarean/perineal pain; back pain; constipation; haemorrhoids; urinary and bowel incontinence) for ≥ 2 time points. A high burden of breastfeeding problems was having ≥ 2 problems (mastitis; nipple pain; frequent expressing; over- or under-supply of milk) for ≥ 2 time points. Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between maternal mood, assessed using Profile of Mood States (8-week postpartum), and a high burden of breastfeeding and/or physical health problems. Forty-six women (20.1%) had a high burden of physical symptoms, 44 (19.2%) a high burden of breastfeeding problems only and 25 women (11.0%) had both. A high burden of breastfeeding problems alone (β = 10.6, p = 0.01) or with co-morbid physical problems (β = 15.35, p = 0.002) was significantly associated with poorer maternal mood at 8 weeks. Early, effective postnatal treatment of maternal health and breastfeeding problems could reduce women’s risk for poor mental health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Term nulliparous women have the greatest variation across hospitals and providers in cesarean rates and therefore present an opportunity to improve quality through optimal care. We evaluated associations between provider type and mode of birth, including examination of intrapartum management in healthy, laboring nulliparous women. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected perinatal data from a United States academic medical center (2005‐2012). The sample included healthy nulliparous women with spontaneous labor onset and term, singleton, vertex fetus managed by either obstetricians or certified nurse‐midwives. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to compare labor interventions and mode of birth by provider type. Results: A total of 1339 women received care by an obstetrician (n = 749) or nurse‐midwife (n = 590). The cesarean rate was 13.4% (179/1339). Adjusting for maternal and pregnancy characteristics, care by obstetricians was associated with an increased risk of unplanned cesarean birth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.48 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.04‐2.12]) compared with care by midwives. Obstetricians more frequently used oxytocin augmentation (aOR 1.41 [95% CI 1.10‐1.80]), neuraxial anesthesia (aOR 1.69 [95% CI 1.29‐2.23]), and operative vaginal delivery with forceps or vacuum (aOR 2.79 [95% CI 1.75‐4.44]). Adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes were not different by provider type across all modes of birth, but were more frequent in women with cesarean than vaginal births. Discussion: In low‐risk nulliparous laboring women, care by obstetricians compared with nurse‐midwives was associated with increased risk of labor interventions and operative birth. Changes in labor management or increased use of nurse‐midwives could decrease the rate of a first cesarean in low‐risk laboring women.

        <ab>Aim: To compare the factors that affect maternal confidence at 1 month post-partum between older (≥35 years old) and younger (20–34 years old) primiparous Japanese mothers. Methods: A multicenter prospective study of mothers who gave birth to live singleton infants in Japan was conducted. Following ethics approval, the participants completed questionnaires 1 day before discharge and 1 month after childbirth. The questionnaires included the Postpartum Maternal Confidence Scale, demographics and background information, prenatal and obstetric data, situational variables and perceptions of daily life, and social support. The obstetric data were extracted from the hospital medical records. Data from the older primiparae (n = 479) and the younger primiparae (n = 1033) were analyzed by using multiple stepwise regressions, controlling for the delivery mode. Results: Maternal confidence at 1 month post-partum was positively associated with emotional support for the older primiparae and appraisal support and exclusive breastfeeding for younger primiparae. In both groups, feeling overwhelmed by daily life, a lack of communication with their partner about the parenting role, and a lack of prior experience in caring for babies were negatively related to maternal confidence. Family budget instability was negatively related to maternal confidence in the younger group. Conclusion: Providing care that is based on an understanding of the unique support needs of first-time mothers in different age groups could promote more effective parenting.

        <ab>Background: Quantitative sensory testing (QST) measures response to painful stimuli and has been used to predict post‐caesarean pain. Pain reported upon intravenous cannulation was shown to predict epidural analgesic use and pain intensity during labour. We hypothesized that pain intensity reported by women upon local anaesthesia injection (ILA) for spinal anaesthesia may predict acute pain after caesarean delivery (CD). Methods: In a prospective observational trial, 229 women undergoing elective CD under spinal anaesthesia were enrolled. Using standardized script before ILA, women received ILA (lidocaine 1% 2.5 mL via 25 G needle), and provided an ILA score after the injection [verbal numeric pain scale (VNPS); 0–100]. Demographic data, average, peak pain (at rest, with movement and uterine cramping) and analgesic requests were recorded for the first 24 h. Results: Fourteen percent of women experienced severe pain (VNPS ≥ 70) upon ILA. Good correlation was noted between ILA and pain scores at rest and upon mobilization during the 24 h following surgery (average resting pain r = 0.529, p &lt; 0.001, average pain at mobilization r = 0.483, p &lt; 0.0001). Severe acute postoperative pain (VNPS ≥70) was predicted by severe ILA pain with a sensitivity of 91.6% and specificity of 93.3%. Conclusion: This is the first study evaluating a clinical measure to predict post‐caesarean pain. Our main findings were that 14% of women experience severe pain upon ILA, which was associated with increased pain during the first 24 h.

        <ab>Introduction: Most seizures during pregnancy occur in women who already have epilepsy. Rarely, some women may have their first seizure during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features and pregnancy outcomes in women with new-onset epilepsy during pregnancy. Methods: 112 pregnant women with epilepsy were prospectively evaluated at the Education—Therapeutic Clinic of the Azerbaijan Medical University, in the neurological and maternity departments of the Clinical Medical Center in Baku over a six-year period. Women were regularly followed by a neurologist and obstetrician till the end of pregnancy. To determine the recurrence of seizures during the pregnancy and after delivery, the women were followed up at least once per three months for a one year period after delivery. Delivery and perinatal outcomes were compared with those of 277 healthy women in the control group (without epilepsy and without registering chronic diseases). Results: Of the 112 pregnant women with epilepsy, 12 (10.7%) had their first seizures during the pregnancy: 6 in the 1st, 4 in the 2nd, 2 in the 3rd trimester. Women with new-onset epilepsy had increased risk of cesarean section and perinatal hypoxia in offspring, compared with controls (Odds ratio [OR]: 13.57; 95% confidence interval (CI):2.86-64.31 and OR: 3.61; 95 % CI: 1.06-12.27, respectively). The risks of cesarean section and perinatal hypoxia were not increased in women with new-onset epilepsy compared to women with epilepsy before pregnancy (OR 2.64; 95 % CI 0.54-12.93 and OR 2.18, 95% CI 0.61-7.76, respectively). Conclusion: In our cohort, women with new-onset epilepsy may have an increased risk of delivery by cesarean section and perinatal hypoxia compared to pregnant controls. The risks were not increased compared to women with epilepsy before pregnancy. Neonatal hypoxia was associated with delivery by cesarean section.

        <ab>Background: Despite high rates of women's use of intrapartum pain management techniques, little is known about the factors that influence such use. Objective: Examine the determinants associated with women's use of labour pain management. Design: Cross‐sectional survey of a substudy of women from the ‘young’ cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health (ALSWH). Setting and participants: Women aged 31–35 years who identified as being pregnant or recently given birth in the 2009 ALSWH survey (n = 2445) were recruited for the substudy. The substudy survey was completed by 1835 women (RR = 79.2%). Main variables studied: Determinants examined included pregnancy health and maternity care [including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)] for their most recent pregnancy and any previous pregnancies. Participants' attitudes and beliefs related to both CAM and maternity care were also included in the analysis. Main outcome measures: The outcome measures examined were the use of both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological pain management techniques (NPMT). Results: Differences were seen in the effects of demographics, health service utilization, health status, use of CAM, and attitudes and beliefs upon use of intrapartum pain management techniques across all categories. The only variable that was identified as a determinant for use of all types of pain management techniques was a previous caesarean section (CS). Discussion and conclusions: The effect of key determinants on women's use of pain management techniques differs significantly, and, other than CS, no one determinant is clearly influential in the use of all pain management options.

        <ab>Background: Fear of childbirth and mode of delivery are two known factors that affect birth experience. The interactions between these two factors are unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of different levels of fear of birth and mode of delivery on birth experience 1 month after birth. Methods: As part of an ongoing prospective study, we interviewed 3,006 women in their third trimester and 1 month after first childbirth to assess fear of birth and birth experience. Logistic regression was performed to examine the interactions and associations between fear of birth, mode of delivery and birth experience. Results: Compared with women with low levels of fear of birth, women with intermediate levels of fear, and women with high levels of fear had a more negative birth experience and were more affected by an unplanned cesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery. Compared with women with low levels of fears with a noninstrumental vaginal delivery, women with high levels of fear who were delivered by unplanned cesarean section had a 12-fold increased risk of reporting a negative birth experience (OR 12.25; 95% CI 7.19–20.86). A noninstrumental vaginal delivery was associated with the most positive birth experience among the women in this study. Conclusions: This study shows that both levels of prenatal fear of childbirth and mode of delivery are important for birth experience. Women with low fear of childbirth who had a noninstrumental vaginal delivery reported the most positive birth experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Reports the findings of a prospective longitudinal study of 272 nulliparous pregnant women (mean age 28.25 yrs), which investigated as one of its objectives the psychological sequelae of obstetric procedures. Ss completed structured interviews and standardized, published psychometric questionnaires, including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Profile of Mood States late in pregnancy and again early in the postpartum period. Little evidence was found to support the notion that the total number of obstetric interventions was linked to a deterioration in postpartum mood. Significant adverse psychological effects were associated with the mode of delivery. Those women who had spontaneous vaginal deliveries were most likely to experience a marked improvement in mood and an elevation in self-esteem across the late pregnancy to early postpartum interval. In contrast, women who had Caesarean deliveries were significantly more likely to experience a deterioration in mood and a diminution in self-esteem. The group who experienced instrumental intervention in vaginal deliveries fell midway between the other 2 groups, reporting neither an improvement nor a deterioration in mood and self esteem.

        <ab>Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common and may require treatment in adulthood. We aimed to investigate the treatment patterns and perinatal outcomes of women with any history of stimulant treatment for ADHD. Methods: We used health records of the New South Wales (NSW, Australia) population to compare perinatal outcomes of women treated with stimulants (dexamphetamine or methylphenidate) for ADHD from 1982 to 2012 who gave birth between 1994 and 2012, with perinatal outcomes of women with no known ADHD or stimulant treatment (comparison cohort). Five comparison women, matched by maternal age and infant year of birth, were selected for each treated woman. Pregnancy outcome odds ratios in the two groups were adjusted for confounders including maternal age and smoking. Results: Of 5056 women treated for ADHD with stimulant medication, 3351 (66.3%) had stimulant treatment documented before the index pregnancy but not within 1 year before the expected date of delivery, 175 (3.5%) had stimulant treatment before and possibly during pregnancy (stimulant prescription within the 12 months directly before the expected date of the index birth and earlier), and 1530 (30.2%) had no stimulant treatment until after the index pregnancy. Treatment for ADHD at any time (before, before and during and only after the index pregnancy) was associated with reduced likelihood of spontaneous labour—odds ratios (ORs) 0.7 [0.7, 0.8], 0.7 [0.5, 0.9], and 0.7 [0.7, 0.8], respectively—and increased risk of caesarean delivery (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 1.3 [0.9, 1.8], 1.3 [1.1, 1.4]); active neonatal resuscitation (1.2 [1.0, 1.3], 1.7 [1.1, 2.7], 1.3 [1.0, 1.7]); and neonatal admission &gt; 4 h (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 1.7 [1.2, 2.4], 1.2 [1.0, 1.4]). Treatment before or before and during pregnancy was, in addition, associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia (1.2 [1.0, 1.4], 1.5 [0.8, 2.6]); preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks (1.2 [1.0, 1.3], 1.4 [0.9, 2.3]); and 1-min Apgar &lt; 7 (1.2 [1.1, 1.3], 2.0 [1.4, 2.9]). Stimulant prescribing was low during pregnancy (3.5% of women received such a prescription) and dropped during the 12 months before the due date from an average of 24.7 prescriptions per month in the first 6 months to 4.5 per month in the final 6 months. Conclusions: Compared with no treatment, ADHD stimulant treatment at any time was associated with small increases in the risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes; treatment before, or before and during pregnancy, was associated with additional adverse outcomes, even after a treatment-free period of several years. None of these associations can be confidently attributed to stimulant treatment; in all cases ADHD per se or correlates of it could be responsible for the association.

        <ab>Background: Although longitudinal trajectories of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are well-established in general trauma populations, very little is known about the trajectories of birth-related PTSD. This study aimed to identify trajectories of birth-related PTSD; determine factors associated with each trajectory; and identify women more likely to develop birth-related PTSD. Method: 226 women who had traumatic childbirth according to DSM-IV criterion A were drawn from a community sample of 950 women. Measures were taken of PTSD, affective symptoms, fear of childbirth and social support in pregnancy, 4–6 weeks and 6-months postpartum. Information on some obstetric and psychosocial factors were also prospectively obtained. Results: Four trajectories were identified: resilience (61.9%), recovery (18.5%), chronic-PTSD (13.7%) and delayed-PTSD (5.8%). Resilience was consistently distinguished from other PTSD trajectories by less affective symptoms at 4–6 weeks postpartum. Poor satisfaction with health professionals was associated with chronic-PTSD and delayed-PTSD. When affective symptoms at 4–6 weeks postpartum were removed from the model, less social support and higher fear of childbirth 4–6 weeks after birth predicted chronic and recovery trajectories; whereas experience of further trauma and low levels of satisfaction with health professionals were predictive of chronic-PTSD and delayed-PTSD, compared to resilience. Additional variables associated with different trajectories included antenatal affective symptoms, caesarean-section, preterm birth and receiving professional help. Limitations: Use of self-report measures, use of DSM-IV criteria for PTSD diagnosis, and no follow-up beyond six months are the main limitations of this study. Conclusion: Identified factors may inform preventive and treatment interventions for women with traumatic birth experiences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To study the self-reported prevalence of experienced violence among a cohort of women about two years after giving birth, their health during pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and their experience of their child’s health. Setting and subjects: In 2011, a total of 657 women participated in phase III of the Childbirth and Health Cohort Study in Icelandic Primary Health Care, 18 to 24 months after delivery. The women had previously participated in phase I around pregnancy week 16 and phase II 5–6 months after delivery. Data were collected by postal questionnaires. Main outcome measures: Women’s reported history of experienced violence, sociodemographic and obstetric background, self-perceived health, the use of medications and their child’s perceived health. Results: In phase III, 16% of women reported experiencing violence. These women felt less support from their current partner (p &lt; 0.001), compared to those who did not report violence. Their pregnancies were more frequently unplanned (p &lt; 0.001), deliveries more often by caesarean section (p &lt; 0.05), and their self-perceived health was worse (p &lt; 0.001). They reported more mental and somatic health complaints, and their use of antidepressant drugs was higher (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, women with a history of violence considered their child’s general health as worse (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Our study confirms that a history of violence is common among women. A history of violence is associated with various maternal health problems during and after pregnancy, a higher rate of caesarean sections and maternal reports of health problems in their child 18–24 months after birth.

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 37(1) of Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care (see record [rid]2010-03976-012[/rid]). We wish to correct the following errors: Page 273 Table 4 The p value for 'Emergency cesarean section' should read 0.1. The heading for column two should read 'OR or log odds ratios (95% CI)' rather than 'OR or RR (95% CI).' Page 274 The text that refers to the findings in Table 4, in relation to mode of delivery and pain relief, should read: 'Being unaccompanied at birth was a marginally significant risk factor for having an emergency cesarean section (p = 0.1) and for receiving a general anesthetic (p = 0.05), and was associated with a significant increased risk of having spinal pain relief anesthesia (p &lt; 0.05).'] Background: Studies have highlighted the benefits of social support during labor but no studies focused on women who choose to be unaccompanied or who have no companion available at birth. Our goals were, first, to identify characteristics of women who are unaccompanied at birth and compare these to those who had support and, second, to establish whether or not being unaccompanied at birth is a risk marker for adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Methods: The sample comprised 16,610 natural mother-infant pairs, excluding women with planned cesarean sections in the Millennium Cohort Study. Multivariable regression models were used to examine, first, sociodemographic, cultural, socioeconomic, and pregnancy characteristics in relation to being unaccompanied and, second, being unaccompanied at birth in relation to labor and delivery outcomes, maternal health and health-related behaviors, parenting, and infant health and development. Results: Mothers who were single (vs not single), multiparous (vs primiparous), of black or Pakistani ethnicity (vs white), from poor households (vs nonpoor), with low levels of education (vs high levels), and who did not attend antenatal classes (vs attenders) were at significantly higher risk of being unaccompanied at birth. Mothers unaccompanied at birth were more likely to have a preterm birth (vs term), an emergency cesarean section (vs spontaneous vaginal delivery) and spinal pain relief or a general anesthetic (vs no pain relief), a shorter labor, and lower satisfaction with life (vs high satisfaction) at 9 months postpartum. Their infants had significantly lower birth weight and were at higher risk of delayed gross motor development (vs normal development). Conclusions: Being unaccompanied at birth may be a useful marker of high-risk mothers and infants in need of additional support in the postpartum period and beyond.

        <ab>Background: Although women with fear of birth often report negative birth experiences, few studies have focused on their experiences in the long term. The aim of this study was to compare birth experiences a year after childbirth in two groups of women receiving treatment for experiencing fear of birth during pregnancy. Methods: As part of the U-CARE: Pregnancy Trial, a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) and standard care among pregnant women with fear of birth. Women were recruited at three Swedish hospitals following a screening procedure that assessed their fear of birth. Data were collected online with the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), one question about the overall birth experience, and questions about personal background, collected before randomization. Results: A total of 181 women responded to the follow-up questionnaire a year after childbirth. Approximately half of participants reported a less positive birth experience. Preferred mode of birth, actual mode of birth, marital status and psychiatric history were associated with the domains of the CEQ. However, no statistically significant differences emerged between the treatment groups. Conclusions: Being randomized to receive iCBT or counseling with midwives for fear of birth was not associated with perceptions of the birth experience assessed a year after birth. Most participants reported less-than-positive birth experiences and scored low on the domain of the CEQ reflecting Own capacity. In response, additional research remains necessary to identify the best model of care that might facilitate positive experiences with giving birth among women with fear of birth.

        <ab>Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman’s ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4–15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score ≤ 9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years ± 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean prepregnancy BMI 30 kg/m² ± 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored ≤ 9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).

        <ab>Background: While it is well established that very preterm birth (gestational age at birth &lt;32weeks) is related to increased attention problems, there is still considerable uncertainty of the effects of moderate or late preterm birth or smallness for gestational age (SGA) on attention regulation. Aims: To investigate the impact of gestational age at birth and SGA, birth on child attention problems. Study design: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. Subjects: A total of 1435 children sampled from the Bavarian Longitudinal Study (BLS). Outcome measures: Main outcome variables were parent-reported attention problems and examiner-reported attention skills at 6 and 8years. Predictors were linked to attention outcomes using hierarchical regression analyses. Results: Gestational age at birth ranged from 25weeks to 41weeks. We found a quadratic effect of gestational age on attention problems (β 6 years = 0.161, 95% CI = 0.085; 0.236; β 8 years = 0.211, 95% CI = 0.135; 0.287), and attention skills at 6 and 8years (β 6 years = −0.178, 95% CI = −0.252; −0.104; β 8 years = −0.169, 95% CI = −0.243; −0.094). Elective caesarean birth did not predict child attention. In adjusted models, SGA was an additional risk factor for attention problems (β = 0.080, 95% CI = 0.026; 0.134), and attention skills (β = −0.091, 95% CI = −0.143; −0.039) at 6years but not at 8years after adjusting for child sex and family SES. Conclusion: Adverse effects on attention are disproportionately higher at early gestations. In contrast, the impact of SGA status was found to be similar at all gestational ages but disappeared by 8years. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>In March 2016, WHO reviewed evidence to develop global recommendations on the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of women living with HIV. Systematic reviews and a global survey of women living with HIV informed the guideline development decision-making process. New recommendations covered abortion, Caesarean section, safe disclosure, and empowerment and self-efficacy interventions. Identification of key research gaps is part of the WHO guidelines development process, but consistent methods to do so are lacking. Our method aimed to ensure consistency and comprised the systematic application of a framework based on GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to the process. The framework incorporates the strength and quality rating of recommendations and the priorities reported by women in the survey to inform research prioritisation. For each gap, we also articulated: (1) the most appropriate and robust study design to answer the question; (2) alternative pragmatic designs if the ideal design is not feasible; and (3) the methodological challenges facing researchers through identifying potential biases. We found 12 research gaps and identified five appropriate study designs to address the related questions: (1) Cross-sectional surveys; (2) Qualitative interview-driven studies; (3) Registries; (4) Randomised controlled trials; and (5) Medical record audit. Methodological challenges included selection, recruitment, misclassification, measurement and contextual biases, and confounding. In conclusion, a framework based on GRADE can provide a systematic approach to identifying research gaps from a WHO guideline. Incorporation of the priorities of women living with HIV into the framework systematically ensures that women living with HIV can shape future policy decisions affecting their lives. Implementation science and participatory research are appropriate over-arching approaches to enhance uptake of interventions and to ensure inclusion of women living with HIV at all stages of the research process.

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the process value of care safety from the patient’s view in perinatal services. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Settings: Fifty two sites of mandated public neonatal health checkup in 6 urban cities in West Japan. Participants: Mothers who attended neonatal health checkups for their babies in 2011 (n = 1316, response rate = 27.4%). Main Outcome Measure: Willingness to pay (WTP) for physician-attended care compared with midwife care as the process-related value of care safety. WTP was estimated using conjoint analysis based on the participants’ choice over possible alternatives that were randomly assigned from among eight scenarios considering attributes such as professional attendance, amenities, painless delivery, caesarean section rate, travel time and price. Results: The WTP for physician-attended care over midwife care was estimated 1283 USD. Women who had experienced complications in prior deliveries had a 1.5 times larger WTP. Conclusions: We empirically evaluated the process value for safety practice in perinatal care that was larger than a previously reported accounting-based value. Our results indicate that measurement of process value from the patient’s view is informative for the evaluation of safety care, and that it is sensitive to individual risk perception for the care process.

        <ab>Purpose: This article explores the development and evaluation of a smartphone mobile software application (app) to collect qualitative data. The app was specifically designed to capture real‐time qualitative data from women planning a vaginal birth after caesarean delivery. This article outlines the design and development of the app to include funding, ethics, and the recruitment of an app developer, as well as the evaluation of using the app by seven participants. Organizing Construct: Data collection methods used in qualitative research include interviews and focus groups (either online, face‐to‐face, or by phone), participant diaries, or observations of interactions. This article identifies an alternative data collection methodology using a smartphone app to collect real‐time data. Conclusions: The app provides real‐time data and instant access to data alongside the ability to access participants from a variety of locations. This allows the researcher to gain insight into the experiences of participants through audio or video recordings in longitudinal studies without the need for constant interactions or interviews with participants. Clinical Relevance: Using smartphone applications can allow researchers to access participants who are traditionally hard to reach and access their data in real time. Evaluating these apps before use in research is invaluable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Childbirth impacts sexual function in women, but few reports have addressed sexual function shortly after childbirth. Aim: Using the Taiwan version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFIT), this study aimed to describe women's sexual function and to examine differences between groups in sexual function shortly after delivery. Methods: A prospective longitudinal investigation was performed in women who completed the FSFIT, a numeric analog scale, the Taiwan version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and a demographic questionnaire in a Taiwanese medical center at 3 days and 6 weeks postpartum. Main Outcome Measures: Using a general linear model, differences were tested between groups, including those defined by delivery mode, type of feeding, depression score, pain score, and birth history. Results: After adjusting for covariates, (i) significant differences in sexual function and desire were found between the vaginal delivery and Cesarean section groups at day 3 and week 6 postpartum (P = 0.0419 and &lt;0.0001, respectively); (ii) differences in desire and satisfaction between the tubal ligation and not groups were significant at both time points (P = 0.0346 and 0.0338); (iii) differences in sexual function and sexual activity or intercourse between low and high CES-D scores were significant at 6 weeks postpartum (P = 0.0040 and 0.0043, respectively); and (iv) differences between pain level groups in sexual activity or intercourse and desire were significant at 6 weeks (P = 0.0493 and 0.0004). At 3 days postpartum, significant differences between educational level and ethnic groups were observed (P = 0.0002 and 0.0414). Conclusions: The results showed significant differences in sexual function shortly after delivery between groups based on delivery method, tubal ligation, depression, pain, ethnicity, and educational level. This information may help health professionals to be more aware of women's perception of sexuality and may foster sensitivity in assessing their sexual function after childbirth.

        <ab>Posttraumatic reactions are common among mothers of preterm infants and can have a negative influence on their quality of life and lead to interactional difficulties with their baby. Given the possible trajectories of posttraumatic reactions, we hypothesized that prevalences of postpartum posttraumatic reactions at given times underestimate the real amount of mothers experiencing these symptoms within 18 months following delivery. Additionally, we examined whether sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of dyads influence the expression of posttraumatic symptoms among these mothers. A sample of 100 dyads was included in this longitudinal study led by 3 french university hospitals. Preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation and their mothers were followed-up over 18 months and attended 5 visits assessing the infants’ health conditions and the mothers’ psychological state with validated scales. Fifty dyads were retained through the 18 months of the study. The period prevalence of posttraumatic reactions was calculated and a group comparison was conducted to determine their predictive factors. Thirty-six percent of the mothers currently suffered from posttraumatic symptoms 18 months after their preterm delivery. The 18 months period prevalence was 60.4% among all the mothers who participated until the end of the follow-up. There was a statistical link between posttraumatic symptoms and a shorter gestational age at delivery, C-section, and the mother’s psychological state of mind at every assessment time. Only a small proportion of mothers were receiving psychological support at 18 months. Preterm mothers are a population at risk of developing a long-lasting postpartum posttraumatic disorder, therefore immediate and delayed systematic screenings for posttraumatic symptoms are strongly recommended to guide at-risk mothers towards appropriate psychological support.

        <ab>A case-control study was performed to determine whether an association exists between exposure to synthetic oxytocin and a subsequent autism spectrum disorder diagnosis; 171 children under age 18 meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism spectrum disorder criteria were compared to 171 children without autism spectrum disorder diagnosis matched by gender, birth year, gestational age, and maternal age at birth. A conditional logistic regression model was used to examine the association of clinical variables and autism spectrum disorder. Significantly elevated odds ratios for autism spectrum disorder were associated with first-time Cesarean section (odds ratio = 2.56), but not a repeat Cesarean section. Odds ratios were also significantly elevated for subjects whose mother’s body mass index was 35 or higher at birth (odds ratio = 2.34) and subjects in which the reason for delivery was categorized as 'fetal indication' (odds ratio = 2.00). When controlling for these and other variables, the odds of developing autism spectrum disorder were significantly elevated in males with long duration of exposure (odds ratio = 3.48) and high cumulative dose of synthetic oxytocin (odds ratio = 2.79). No significant associations of synthetic oxytocin dosing and autism spectrum disorder were noted in female subjects. The association of elevated autism spectrum disorder odds found with high duration and high cumulative dose synthetic oxytocin in male subjects suggests the need for further investigation to fully elucidate any cause and effect relationship. Lay abstract: Oxytocin is a hormone naturally produced in the human body that can make the womb (uterus) contract during labor. Manufactured oxytocin is frequently given to mothers in labor to strengthen the contractions or in some cases to start labor. This study compared children with a diagnosis of autism and children without autism to see whether children with autism received more oxytocin during labor. The odds of a child having an autism diagnosis were significantly higher if the delivery was a first-time Cesarean section, if the mother had a body mass index of 35 or higher, or if the reason for delivery were a range of fetal problems that made delivery necessary. It was found that boys who were exposed to oxytocin for longer periods of time during labor and received higher total doses of oxytocin had significantly higher odds of developing autism. There were no significant associations of oxytocin dosing and autism noted in female children. As this is the first study to look at any relationship between the dose of oxytocin received during labor and the odds of developing autism, further study needs to be done to determine whether there is any cause and effect relationship. Thus, at this time, there is no recommended change in clinical practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate perinatal outcomes and experiences of managing gestational diabetes (GDM) in a multiethnic cohort from a community hospital. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 647 ethnically diverse women with GDM was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine ethnic differences in cesarean delivery rates and emergency department (ED) utilization during pregnancy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate experiences of GDM and perceptions of type 2 diabetes risk. Results: Significant differences were observed between sample groups in mother’s age (P = .004), education level (P &lt; .001), family history of diabetes (P &lt; .001), and baby birthweight (P = .004). In the fully adjusted model, controlling for maternal age, BMI category, ED utilization during pregnancy, and family history of diabetes, Southeast and East Asian women had the lowest rates of cesarean delivery and ED utilization during pregnancy, with significantly higher rates of cesarean delivery in Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and Asian Indian women (P &lt; .001). There was preliminary evidence for higher ED utilization rates during pregnancy in Hispanic women with GDM (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% CI, 0.79-4.08; P = .005). Interview analyses reflected strong psychological impact of GDM diagnoses. Women expressed shock and disappointment over diagnoses and highlighted need for psychological support from health care professionals. Risk perceptions for type 2 diabetes were low. Conclusions: Findings support significant ethnic differences in cesarean delivery and ED utilization among women with GDM. Qualitative analysis suggests that culturally sensitive approaches informing psychosocial support and dietary recommendations are important considerations for a diverse GDM patient population.

        <ab>Background: How a woman gives birth can affect her health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study explored HRQoL at 3 months postpartum in women with a history of one previous cesarean in three European countries. Methods: A prospective longitudinal survey, embedded within a cluster randomized trial in three countries, exploring women’s postnatal HRQoL up to 3 months postpartum. The Short-Form Six-Dimensions (SF-6D) was used to measure HRQoL, and multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship with mode of birth. Results: Complete data were available from 880 women. Women with a spontaneous vaginal birth had the highest HRQoL scores, whereas women with an emergency repeat cesarean (P = .01) had the lowest. Postnatal readmission of the mother (P = .03), having public health insurance (P = .04), and a low antenatal HRQoL score (P &lt; .01) contributes to poorer HRQoL scores. More specifically, women with a spontaneous vaginal birth had significantly higher HRQoL scores on the vitality dimension compared with women with an emergency repeat cesarean (P = .04). Conclusions: In women with low-risk factors, repeat cesareans result in a poorer HRQoL compared with vaginal birth. When there are no contraindications for vaginal birth, women with a history of one previous cesarean should be encouraged to give birth vaginally rather than have an elective repeat cesarean.

        <ab>Objectives: to compare the pelvic floor muscle strength in primiparous women after normal birth and cesarean section, related to the socio-demographic characteristics, nutritional status, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, perineal exercise in pregnancy, perineal condition and weight of the newborn. Methods: this was a cross-sectional study conducted after 50 - 70 postpartum days, with 24 primiparous women who underwent cesarean delivery and 72 who had a normal birth. The 9301 PeritronTM was used for analysis of muscle strength. The mean muscle strength was compared between the groups by two-way analysis of variance. Results: the pelvic floor muscle strength was 24.0 cmH2O (±16.2) and 25.4 cmH2O (±14.7) in postpartum primiparous women after normal birth and cesarean section, respectively, with no significant difference. The muscular strength was greater in postpartum women with ≥ 12 years of study (42.0 ± 26.3 versus 14.6 ± 7.7 cmH2O; p = 0.036) and in those who performed perineal exercises (42.6 ± 25.4 11.8 ± 4.9 vs. cmH2O; p = 0.010), compared to caesarean. There was no difference in muscle strength according to delivery type regarding nutritional status, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, perineal condition or newborn weight. Conclusion: pelvic floor muscle strength does not differ between primiparous women based on the type of delivery. Postpartum women with normal births, with higher education who performed perineal exercise during pregnancy showed greater muscle strength.

        <ab>Background: The impact of delivery mode on the development of urinary incontinence has been much debated. The primary objective of this systematic review was to compare the prevalence of postpartum urinary incontinence after cesarean section compared with vaginal birth. Methods: The MEDLINE (1966-2005) and CINAHL (1982-2005) databases were searched for reports specifying postpartum prevalence or incidence of unspecified, stress, urge, and mixed urinary incontinence by mode of birth. Primary authors were contacted to request unpublished data about severity, parity, and timing of cesarean section. All data were entered into Review Manager software, and odds ratio (OR), absolute risk reduction, and number needed to prevent were calculated. Results: Cesarean section reduced the risk of postpartum stress urinary incontinence from 16 to 9.8 percent (OR = 0.56 [0.45, 0.68], number needed to prevent = 15 [12,22]) in 6 cross-sectional studies, and from 22 to 10 percent in 12 cohort studies (OR = 0.48 [0.39, 0.58], number needed to prevent = 10 [8,13]). Differences persisted by parity and after exclusion of instrumental delivery, but risk of severe stress urinary incontinence and urge urinary incontinence did not differ by mode of birth. Conclusions: Although short-term occurrence of any degree of postpartum stress urinary incontinence is reduced with cesarean section, severe symptoms are equivalent by mode of birth. Risk of postpartum stress urinary incontinence must be considered in the context of associated maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality.

        <ab>Objective: To examine associations between statelevel characteristics and state-level preterm birth rates. Study design: We conducted a retrospective ecological cross-sectional study using statelevel data from 2013 to 2014 extracted from publicly available sources –the March of Dimes PeriStats database, the U.S. Census Bureau, the US Department of Education, and the US Department of Justice. Results: State-level preterm birth rates correlated with the following state characteristics: poverty rate, obesity rate, percentage of non-Hispanic Black women residents, smoking rate, percent of C—section deliveries, percent of births to women &lt; 20 years old, pregnancies receiving late/no prenatal care, and violent crimes per capita. Linear regression analysis found that only the percent of non-Hispanic Black women by state remained a significant predictor of state-level preterm birth rates after adjusting for other risk factors. Conclusions: States with higher percentages of non-Hispanic Black women had higher rates of preterm birth, even after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, prenatal care, and maternal health by state. These findings suggest that public health interventions that target contextual and environmental risk factors affecting non-Hispanic Black women may help to curb rising rates of preterm birth in the United States.

        <ab>Background: In Norway, intervention in childbirth has increased from 3 percent in 1967 to 37 percent in 2006. The objectives of this study were, first, to estimate to which extent women who expressed a preference for natural birth actually were delivered vaginally without interventions, and second, to estimate the influence that emotions and maternal background factors have on the mode of delivery. Methods: We used data from 39,475 pregnancies of participants in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study in which the pregnant woman had expressed a preference for natural birth, and linked these data with the pregnancy outcome as registered in the population-based Medical Birth Registry of Norway during 2000 to 2006. The influence of maternal factors on the mode of delivery was estimated with log-binomial regression models, stratified by parity. Results: Among primiparas, 29.3 percent delivered vaginally without interventions (natural birth), 56.1 percent gave birth vaginally with interventions, and 14.5 percent had a cesarean section. The strongest predictor for actually having a natural birth was age below 25 years, having more than 12 years’ education, carrying a single fetus, and having a low score for anxiety and depression. Among multiparas, 61.1 percent gave birth vaginally without interventions, 30.6 percent vaginally with interventions, and only 8.3 percent had a cesarean section. The effects of maternal age, education, and anxiety or depression on the outcome were smaller for multiparas than for primiparas. Conclusions: The chance of actually having a natural birth for women with a preference for a natural birth is much greater for multiparas than for primiparas. The factors that influence the chance of having a natural birth are different for primiparas and multiparas. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Pregnancy mobile apps are becoming increasingly popular, with parents-to-be seeking information related to their pregnancy and their baby through mobile technology. This increase raises the need for prenatal apps with evidence-based content that is personalized and reliable. Previous studies have looked at whether prenatal apps impact health and behavior outcomes among pregnant and postpartum individuals; however, research has been limited. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the use of a health system–sponsored mobile app—Circle by Providence—aimed at providing personalized and reliable health information on pregnancy, postpartum recovery, and infant care is associated with improved health outcomes and increased healthy behaviors and knowledge among users. Methods: This observational study compared app users and app nonusers using a self-reported survey and electronic medical records. The study took place over 18 months and was conducted at Providence St. Joseph Health in Portland, Oregon. The sample included patients who received prenatal care at one of seven Providence clinics and had a live birth at a Providence hospital. Recruitment occurred on a rolling basis and only those who completed the survey were included. Survey respondents were separated into app users and app nonusers, and survey responses and clinical outcomes were compared across groups using univariate and adjusted multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 567 participants were enrolled in the study—167 in the app user group and 400 in the nonuser group. We found statistically significant differences between the two groups for certain behavior outcomes: subjects who used the app had 75% greater odds of breastfeeding beyond 6 months postpartum (P=.012), were less likely to miss prenatal appointments (P=.046), and were 50% more likely to exercise 3 or more times a week during pregnancy (P=.04). There were no differences in nutritional measures, including whether they took prenatal vitamins, ate 5 fruits or vegetables a day, or drank caffeine. We found no differences in many of the infant care outcomes; however, there was an increase in awareness of 'purple crying.' Finally, there were no significant differences in measured clinical health outcomes, including cesarean births, length of hospital stays (in minutes), low birth weight infants, preterm births, small-for-gestational-age births, large-for-gestational-age births, and neonatal intensive care unit stays. Conclusions: The use of the Circle app, which provides access to personalized and evidence-based health information, was associated with an increase in certain healthy behaviors and health knowledge, although there was no impact on clinical health outcomes. More research is needed to determine the impact of mobile prenatal apps on healthy pregnancies, clinical health outcomes, and infant care.

        <ab>Study Objective: This cohort study examined the impact of maternal snoring on key delivery outcomes such as mode of delivery, infant birth centile, and small-for-gestational age. Design: Cohort study. Setting: A large tertiary medical center. Patients or Participants: Pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010. Measurements and Results: Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-for-gestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Preterm birth has been associated with greater psychological distress and less positive mother infant interactions than were experienced by mothers of full‐term infants. Maternal and infant sociodemographic factors have also shown a strong association with psychological distress and the mother‐infant relationship. However, findings on their effects over time are limited. In this longitudinal analysis, we explored the relationship of maternal and infant sociodemographic variables (maternal age, maternal education, marital status, being on social assistance, maternal race, infant birth weight, and infant gender) to maternal psychological distress (depressive, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, parenting stress symptoms, and maternal worry about child's health) through 12 months corrected age for prematurity, and on the home environment, and mother‐infant interactions through 6 months corrected age for prematurity. We also explored differences related to maternal obstetrical characteristics (gestational age at birth, parity, mode of delivery, and multiple birth) and severity of infant conditions (Apgar scores, need for mechanical ventilation, and infant medical complications). Although the relationship of maternal and infant characteristics with these outcomes did not change over time, psychological distress differed based on marital status, maternal education, infant gender, and infant medical complications. Older mothers provided more a positive home environment. Mother‐infant interactions differed by maternal age, being on public assistance, maternal race, infant gender, and infant medical complications. More longitudinal research is needed to better understand these effects over time in order to identify and support at‐risk mothers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Overweight and obesity among children under the age of 5 have become a public health problem. The worldwide prevalence is 4.9% and 6.0%, whereas in Peru it is 7.4% and 1.9%, respectively. The causes of these problems are multifactorial and must be studied to prevent the multiple consequences on children's health. Methods: Secondary data analysis of the 2016 Demographic and Family Health Survey (DHS). The sample size was 7935 children and their mothers. The dependent variable was childhood overweight/obesity, measured according to the Z-score of the BMI &gt;2 standard deviation (SD), while the main independent variable consisted of the maternal depressive symptoms (DS) (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score &gt;10 points). The software STATA/MP 14.0 was used for statistical analysis. Results: The prevalence of overweight/obesity among children aged 0–5 years was 4.5% and the prevalence of moderate and severe maternal DS was 7.1%. No maternal depressive symptoms were found to be associated with the outcome [adjusted PR = 1.36 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59–3.09 p = 0.47]. An association was found between socioeconomic status (SES) Q3 (adjusted PR = 3.86 95% CI = 1.9–7.6 p &lt; 0.0001), Q4 (adjusted PR = 5.53 95% CI = 2.76–11.1 p &lt; 0.0001), Q5 (adjusted PR = 6.9 95% CI = 3.24–14.7 p = &lt; 0.0001), maternal BMI (adjusted PR = 1.06 95% CI = 1.03–1.08 p &lt; 0.0001), and cesarean delivery (adjusted PR = 1.42 95% CI = 1.01–1.99 p = 0.042). Conclusions: No association was found between maternal depressive symptoms and overweight/obesity among children aged 0–5 years. The upper SES quintiles, maternal BMI, and cesarean delivery were associated with the outcome. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the influence of OPRM1 polymorphism on the analgesic efficacy (including visual analog scale [VAS] scores and requirement for rescue analgesia) of a standard dose of intrathecal morphine. Materials and Methods: An Italian cohort of 63 parturients, scheduled for elective cesarean section at a tertiary University Hospital, received spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine and morphine 100 mcg. For the first 48 hours in the postoperative period the patients received acetaminophen 1 g IV q6hr. Incident pain was treated with ketorolac 30 mg IV. Every 6 hours the following parameters were registered: VAS at rest, VAS during movements, postoperative nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and rescue analgesic medications requirements. Age and anthropometric data, number of pregnancies, educational level, OPRM1 genotype, were also obtained. Results: Of the 63 patients enrolled, 45 (71%) were homozygous genotype A/A (118A group), whereas 18 carried the G variants of OPRM1 (A/G or G/G) (118G group). No significant differences in analgesic rescue doses’ administration and in incidence of moderate/severe postoperative pain (VAS &gt; 3) between the 2 groups were observed. Pruritus was more frequent in the 118A group than in the 118G group in the first 24 hours of the postoperative period. Discussion: In the Italian population participating in this study there was a different incidence of pruritus in the postcesarean period in response to intrathecal opioids related to OPRM1 gene polymorphism, but not of postoperative pain.

        <ab>The purpose of this matched-cohort survey was to determine whether there is a difference between unmarried adolescent mothers and married adult mothers in terms of satisfaction with inpatient postpartum nursing care. Eighty adolescent/adult postpartum mother pairs from a mid-sized teaching hospital were matched according to parity, mode of delivery, infant health status, and infant feeding method. Adolescents scored lower than adults on both the Experiences of Nursing Care Scale and the Satisfaction with Nursing Care Scale of the Newcastle Satisfaction with Nursing Scales. Among the adolescents, post-caesarean mothers were less satisfied than mothers who had delivered vaginally. Adolescent mothers' dissatisfaction with nurse availability and nurse-client communication are possible explanatory factors. Future qualitative studies will inform the design of interventions to improve satisfaction among adolescent mothers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental disorder commonly associated with functional impairments and adverse health outcomes. Very little is known about BPD in pregnant women; hence, our study objective was to evaluate the effect of BPD on obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2003 to 2012. We identified births using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic and procedure codes and classified women by BPD status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of BPD on obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, adjusted for subject baseline characteristics. Findings: During the study period, there were 989 births to women with BPD with an overall incidence of 11.65 in 100,000 births. Women with BPD were more likely younger, of lower socioeconomic status, smoked or used drugs, and had an underlying mental disorder. Unadjusted models revealed that BPD was associated with an increased risk of almost all adverse maternal and fetal outcomes we examined, the exception being postpartum hemorrhage and instrumental delivery, which both had a null association with BPD, and induction of labor, which was negatively associated with BPD. Upon full adjustment, BPD was found to be associated with the following obstetrical and neonatal outcomes: gestational diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13–1.85), premature rupture of the membranes (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07–1.83), chorioamnionitis (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.14–2.39), venous thromboembolism (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.12–3.96), caesarian delivery (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.26–1.64), and preterm birth (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.29–1.83). Conclusion: BPD is associated with several adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Hence, pregnant women who suffer from BPD should be monitored closely by a multidisciplinary health care team both before and during their pregnancies. This oversight would allow for the receipt of treatment for BPD and also interventions to help them to cease tobacco and drug use, which may ultimately decrease the incidence of poor obstetrical and neonatal outcomes.

        <ab>Background: In view of the reported increase in obstetric anal sphincter injuries, the objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of such injuries over time and the associated risk and protective factors. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study from a national database of 168 137 primiparous women with term, singleton, cephalic, vaginal delivery between 2008 and 2014. The main outcome measure was obstetric anal sphincter injury. A multivariate regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors. Results: Age &gt; 19 years, birthweight &gt; 4000 g, and operative vaginal delivery were independent risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Mediolateral episiotomy increased the risk for obstetric anal sphincter injuries in spontaneous vaginal birth (number needed to harm 333), whereas it was protective in vacuum delivery (number needed to treat 50). From 2008 to 2014, there was an increase in the rate of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (2.1% vs 3.1%, P &lt; .01), vacuum deliveries (12.1% vs 12.8%, P &lt; .01), and cesarean delivery after labor (17.1% vs 19.4%, P &lt; .01), while forceps deliveries (0.4% vs 0.1%, P &lt; .01) and episiotomy rate decreased (35.9% vs 26.4%, P &lt; .01). Conclusions: Episiotomy may be a risk or protective factor depending on the type of episiotomy and the clinical setting in which it is used. Our study supports a restrictive use of mediolateral episiotomy in spontaneous vaginal deliveries. In vacuum deliveries mediolateral episiotomy may help prevent obstetric anal sphincter injuries.

        <ab>Objectives: Obesity and depression have become prevalent pregnancy complications, individually associated with adverse perinatal health outcomes. Despite the co-prevalence of these two risk factors, their combined effects on maternal health are yet to be studied. The objective of this study was to examine the combined associations of overweight/obesity and depression with maternal and delivery complications. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of women with singleton gestations at &gt; 20 weeks, in Ontario, Canada (April 2007 to March 2010), was conducted. Our primary outcomes were a composite of maternal complications (for example, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, preterm premature rupture of membranes and so on), and a composite of delivery complications (for example, caesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia, postpartum haemorrhage and so on). Results: The study population consisted of 70 605 women, of whom 50.3% were overweight/obese. Depression was reported in 5.0% of normal-weight women and 6.2% of overweight/obese women. The proportion of women with maternal complications was the highest among the overweight/obese depressed pregnant women (16% of normal-weight non-depressed, 22% of normal-weight depressed, 22% of overweight/obese non-depressed and 29% of overweight/obese depressed, P &lt; 0.001), as was the proportion of women with delivery complications (44%, 49%, 50% and 53%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Overweight/obese depressed pregnant women also experienced the highest odds of the composite of maternal complications and the composite of delivery complications (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35–1.77 and OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.13–1.42, respectively) after adjustment for potential confounders. Conclusions: The combined associations of excess weight and depression with adverse pregnancy outcomes are important to recognize in order to focus counselling and care, both before and during pregnancy.

        <ab>Objective: To quantify vitamin D status among pregnant women in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, OR, and Seattle, WA) and examine pregnancy and newborn outcomes in relationship to maternal serum blood samples obtained during pregnancy. Design: A retrospective cohort design. Setting: Data from 2009 to 2013 were abstracted from the health records of two out-of-hospital midwifery practices in the Pacific Northwest. Participants: Women with recorded serum blood samples for vitamin D during pregnancy were included. We reviewed health records of 663 women, and 357 met criteria. Methods: We extracted demographic, biometric, and pregnancy outcome data from participants’ records and analyzed them using regression models. Results: Mean serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) was 29.96 ± 10.9 ng/ml; 45.5% of participants were sufficient (≥ 30 ng/ml), and 55.5% were insufficient or deficient (&lt; 29 ng/ml). Lower vitamin D levels were predicted by Seattle location, greater prepregnancy body mass index, and blood samples drawn during the winter. Vitamin D status was not a predictor of spontaneous abortion, glucose tolerance test result, cesarean birth, infant birth weight, or any other outcome investigated. Conclusion: Although there is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in pregnant women in the Pacific Northwest, adverse health effects were not observed. This may be attributable to the overall healthy profile of the women in our sample. Further research on maternal vitamin D status should focus on identification of optimal vitamin D levels in pregnancy and long-term outcomes among offspring of women who are vitamin D deficient, particularly those from high-risk, vulnerable populations.

        <ab>Reports an error in 'Association of maternal eating disorders with pregnancy and neonatal outcomes' by Ängla Mantel, Angelica Lindén Hirschberg and Olof Stephansson (JAMA Psychiatry, 2020[Mar], Vol 77[3], 285-293). In the original article, surname of the second author was inaccurate. Angelica Lindén Hirschberg should be referred to as Dr Hirschberg, not Dr Lindén Hirschberg. The error has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2020-21761-006[/rid]). Importance: The prevalence of eating disorders is high among women of reproductive age, yet the association of eating disorders with pregnancy complications and neonatal health has not been investigated in detail, to our knowledge. Objective: To investigate the relative risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes for women with eating disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study included all singleton births included in the Swedish Medical Birth Register from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014. A total of 7542 women with eating disorders were compared with 1 225 321 women without eating disorders. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to April 30, 2019. Via linkage with the national patient register, women with eating disorders were identified and compared with women free of any eating disorder. Eating disorders were further stratified into active or previous disease based on last time of diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (hyperemesis, anemia, preeclampsia, and antepartum hemorrhage), the mode of delivery (cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery, or instrumental vaginal delivery), and the neonatal outcomes (preterm birth, small and large sizes for gestational age, Apgar score &lt;7 at 5 minutes, and microcephaly) were calculated using Poisson regression analysis to estimate risk ratios (RRs). Models were adjusted for age, parity, smoking status, and birth year. Results: There were 2769 women with anorexia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 29.4 [5.3] years), 1378 women with bulimia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [4.9] years), and 3395 women with an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS; mean [SD] age, 28.9 [5.3] years), and they were analyzed and compared with 1 225 321 women without eating disorders (mean [SD] age, 30.3 [5.2] years). All subtypes of maternal eating disorders were associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of hyperemesis during pregnancy (anorexia nervosa: RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.8-2.5]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.6-2.7]; EDNOS: RR, 2.6 [95%CI, 2.3-3.0]). The risk of anemia during pregnancy was doubled for women with active anorexia nervosa (RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.3-3.2]) or EDNOS (RR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.5-2.8]). Maternal anorexia nervosa was associated with an increased risk of antepartum hemorrhage (RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.2-2.1]), which was more pronounced in active vs previous disease.Women with anorexia nervosa (RR, 0.7 [95%CI, 0.6-0.9]) and women with EDNOS (RR, 0.8 [95%CI, 0.7-1.0]) were at decreased risk of instrumental-assisted vaginal births; otherwise, there were no major differences in mode of delivery.Women with eating disorders, all subtypes, were at increased risk of a preterm birth (anorexia nervosa: RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.4-1.8]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 1.3 [95%CI, 1.0-1.6]; and EDNOS: RR, 1.4 [95%CI, 1.2-1.6]) and of delivering neonates with microcephaly (anorexia nervosa: RR, 1.9 [95%CI, 1.5-2.4]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.1-2.4]; EDNOS: RR, 1.4 [95%CI, 1.2-1.9]). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that women with active or previous eating disorders, regardless of subtype, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and may need increased surveillance in antenatal and delivery care.

        <ab>Background: We linked census and health service data sets to address the shortage of information comparing maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes by ethnic group in Scotland. Methods: Retrospective cohort study linking the 2001 National Census for Scotland and hospital obstetric data (2001–08), comparing maternal age, smoking status, gestational age, caesarean section rates, birthweight, preterm birth and breastfeeding rates by ethnic group. Results: In all, 144 344 women were identified as having had a first birth between 1 May 2001 and 30 April 2008. White Scottish mothers were younger [mean age 27.3 years; 95% confidence interval (CI): 27.3, 27.4] than other white groups and most non-white groups. They had the highest smoking rates (25.8%; CI: 25.5, 26.0) and the lowest rates of breastfeeding at 6–8 weeks (23.4%; CI: 23.1, 23.6), with most of the other groups being around 40%. Women from non-white minority ethnic groups in Scotland tended to have babies of lower birthweight (e.g. Pakistani mean birthweight–3105 g, white Scottish–3356 g), even after adjustment for gestational age, maternal age, education, smoking and housing tenure. This effect was more noticeable for women born in the UK. White English, Irish and other white babies tended to have higher birthweights. There was little variation between groups in caesarean section rates. Conclusions: Pregnant women from ethnic minority populations in Scotland have more favourable health behaviour than the white Scottish, although the non-white groups tend to have lower birthweight. Further exploration of the reasons for these differences has potential to benefit women from the majority population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Higher rates of adverse outcomes have been reported for early term (37 0 to 38 6 weeks) versus full term (≥ 39 0 weeks) infants, but differences in breastfeeding outcomes have not been systematically evaluated. This study examined breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity in early and full term infants in a large US based sample. Methods: This secondary analysis included 743 geographically- and racially-diverse women from the Measurement of Maternal Stress Study cohort, and 295 women from a quality assessment at a hospital-based clinic in Evanston, IL. Only subjects delivering ≥ 37 weeks were included. Initiation of breastfeeding (IBF) and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) were assessed via electronic medical record review after discharge. Associations of IBF and EBF with early and full term delivery were assessed via univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Among 872 women eligible for inclusion, 85.7% IBF and 44.0% EBF. Early term delivery was not associated with any difference in frequency of IBF (p = 0.43), but was associated with significantly lower odds of EBF (unadjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.466, 0.803, p &lt; 0.001). This association remained significant (adjusted OR 0.694, 95% CI 0.515, 0.935, p = 0.016) after adjusting for maternal diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, maternal age, race/ethnicity, parity, Medicaid status, NICU admission, current smoking, and delivery hospital. Conclusions for Practice: Despite comparable breastfeeding initiation frequencies, early term infants were significantly less likely to be exclusively breastfed compared to full term infants. These data suggest that women with early term infants may benefit from counseling regarding the potential for breastfeeding difficulties as well as additional breastfeeding support after delivery.

        <ab>Aim: To evaluate the association between mode of birth and the resumption of sexual intercourse, self-reported decline in sexual intercourse and dyspareunia in women at the 6th week and 6th month postpartum. Background: Interest in the relationship between mode of birth and postpartum sexual functioning is increasing. However, previous findings are contradictory. Design: Prospective, longitudinal, observational study. Method: The participants comprised 552 healthy primiparous women aged 18–45 years who gave birth at a hospital between February 2013-April 2014. Interviews were performed at the hospital and via telephone at the 6th week and 6th month postpartum. We constructed multivariate logistic regression models to examine the relationship between mode of birth and resumption of intercourse, self-reported decline in sexual intercourse and dyspareunia at the 6th week and 6th month postpartum. Results: At the 6th week postpartum, forceps-assisted birth, combination of episiotomy plus perineal tear and belonging to a higher socio-economic status were related to a higher risk of non-resumption of sexual intercourse, while breastfeeding was related to a higher probability of dyspareunia. At the 6th month postpartum, the likelihood of self-reported decline in sexual intercourse was higher among women who screened positive for postpartum depression and a higher number of breastfeeding women reported a decline in sexual intercourse and dyspareunia. Furthermore, at the 6th month postpartum, women who reported the use of emergency services for a health problem had a higher risk of not having resumed intercourse and of experiencing dyspareunia.

        <ab>Objectives: To determine the prevalence of opioid use before, during, and after pregnancy and describe its use based on patient-specific characteristics. Determine secular trend of opioid use 2006 to 2014. Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort study. A large Upper Midwest integrated health care system and insurer. Female individuals age 10 to 50 years with a delivery diagnosis from July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2014. Main outcome measure: prevalence of opioid use before, during, and after pregnancy; description of opioid use during these time periods. Results: From 11,565 deliveries among 9690 unique women, 862 (7.5%) deliveries were associated with significant opioid use. Significant opioid use was associated with single marital status, Cesarean section, Medicaid coverage, tobacco use, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, nonopioid analgesic use, and referral to physical therapy, psychotherapy, or pain specialists. From 2006 to 2014 opioid use decreased from 9% to 6% before, during, and after pregnancy with a rate of change per year of −0.2%. Discussion: Known risk factors including tobacco and alcohol use, mental health diagnoses, substance use disorder, or Medicaid enrollment may enable enhanced assessments and targeted interventions to reduce unnecessary prescribing and use of opioids among pregnant women and those who might become pregnant. Strategies to decrease opioid use during pregnancy should be considered by health care systems and health plans to reduce opioid prescribing in this patient population.

        <ab>Objective: WHO and UNICEF recommend cup feeding for neonates unable to breastfeed in low-resource settings. In developed countries, cup feeding in lieu of bottle feeding in the neonatal period is hypothesized to improve breastfeeding outcomes for those initially unable to breastfeed. Our aim was to synthesize the entire body of evidence on cup feeding. Methods: We searched domestic and international databases for original research. Our search criteria required original data on cup feeding in neonates published in English between January 1990 and December 2014. Results: We identified 28 original research papers. Ten were randomized clinical trials, 7 non-randomized intervention studies, and 11 observational studies; 11 were conducted in developing country. Outcomes evaluated included physiologic stability, safety, intake, duration, spillage, weight gain, any and exclusive breastfeeding, length of hospital stay, compliance, and acceptability. Cup feeding appears to be safe though intake may be less and spillage greater relative to bottle or tube feeding. Overall, slightly higher proportions of cup fed versus bottle fed infants report any breastfeeding; a greater proportion of cup fed infants reported exclusive breastfeeding at discharge and beyond. Cup feeding increases breastfeeding in subgroups (e.g. those who intend to breastfeed or women who had a Caesarean section). Compliance and acceptability is problematic in certain settings. Conclusions: Further research on long-term breastfeeding outcomes and in low-resource settings would be helpful. Research data on high risk infants (e.g. those with cleft palates) would be informative. Innovative cup feeding approaches to minimize spillage, optimize compliance, and increase breastfeeding feeding are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Limited information is available on whether antipsychotics prescribed in pregnancy are associated with increased risks of adverse outcomes. Methods: We used electronic health records from pregnant women and their children to examine risks of adverse maternal and child outcomes in three cohorts of women who: (A) received antipsychotic treatment in pregnancy (n = 416) (B) discontinued antipsychotic treatment before pregnancy (n = 670), and (C) had no records of antipsychotic treatment before or during pregnancy (n = 318,434). Absolute and risk ratios were estimated and adjusted for health and lifestyle and concomitant medications. Results: Caesarean section was more common in cohort A (25%) than C (18%), but non-significant after adjustment for health and lifestyle factors (Risk Ratio (adj.) 1.09 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.30). Proportion of gestational diabetes was similar in cohort A (2.6%) and B (2.7%), but lower in A than B after adjustments (RRadj: 0.43 (0.20, 0.93). Premature birth/low birthweight were more common in cohort A (10%) than B (4.3%) and C (3.9%), A versus B (RRadj: 2.04 (1.13, 3.67), A versus C (RRadj: 1.43 (0.99, 2.05). Major congenital malformations were more common in A (3.4%), than B (2.2%) and C (2%). However no significant difference was observed (A versus B: RRadj: 1.79 (0.72, 4.47) A versus C RRadj: 1.59 (0.84, 3.00)). Risks estimates were similar for women prescribed atypical and typical antipsychotics. Conclusions: Antipsychotic treatment in pregnancy carries limited risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes once adjustments have been made for health and lifestyle factors.

        <ab>Objectives: Moderate-risk neonates (MRNs) are newborns who usually remain hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) after birth. Although they have low rates of mortality, morbidity burden may be significant and involve neurological risk. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders and the influence of biological and socio-environmental factors on the neurodevelopment of MRN. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of 162 MRNs aged 2–24 months, who remained in NICU ≥ 72 h after birth, with gestational age (GA) ≥ 34 weeks, birth weight ≥ 1500 g, and normal neurological and clinical examinations by the time of hospital discharge. Four neurodevelopmental areas were assessed using the Argentinian test PRUNAPE: language (LG), fine and gross motor skills (FM and GM), and personal-social skills (PS). Data from biological (gestational, perinatal and postnatal) and socio-environmental factors were collected through parental questionnaires. Results: Thirty-four percent of infants failed the test. Gross motor was the most affected area (14.2%), followed by LG (11.7%), FM (7.4%), and PS (4.3%). Among gestational factors global failure was associated with drugs and alcohol consumption (p ≤ 0.029). Language was associated with maternal smoking (p = 0.007; OR 3.5), FM (p = 0.009; OR 13.0), and GM (p = 0.002; OR 10.6) with drug use, and both LG (p = 0.000; OR 22.6) and GM (p = 0.007; OR 16.2) with alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Infants born by cesarean had a higher risk of failure than those born by vaginal delivery (p = 0.049; OR: 2.2), as well as infants with pathological complementary diagnosis (p = 0.001; OR 2.7). Mechanical ventilation was associated with FM disorders (p = 0.025; OR 4.2). Children with siblings had a higher risk of failing the test than only children (p = 0.041; OR 2.0). Conclusions: Rate of neurodevelopmental disorders in MRN exceeds widely that of the general population. GM was the most affected area. Maternal addictions, cesarean birth, pathological complementary studies, MV, and having siblings are factors associated with failure in the screening.

        <ab>Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of changes in depressive symptoms on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in couples. This was examined before, during and after the pregnancy. In addition, (HRQoL) was examined in relation to the mode of delivery. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of 416 couples was conducted in two teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The translated Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were used to measure health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms respectively, and are reported here. Results: The results showed that women and their spouses experienced a noticeable decline in their physical HRQoL during and after the pregnancy. However, their mental health functioning showed a significant improvement following conception. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was high but decreased over the course of the pregnancy. Finally, HRQoL was affected by mode of delivery. Conclusions: The results show that women and their husbands experienced marked changes in perceived health-related functioning and depressive symptoms during and after pregnancy. In addition, the study found that those women who had undergone Cesarean section had higher mental well-being scores. Future research should determine the benefits of extending pre-conception and pre-natal guidelines on the benefits of regular physical activity throughout and after pregnancy in Persian couples.

        <ab>Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate how a scripted counseling intervention affected the experience of decision making and actual choice for trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) or elective repeat cesarean birth (ERCB) in a cohort of women receiving care from nurse-midwives. Methods: A pilot study of scripted counseling for women who had a previous cesarean about TOLAC versus ERCB was conducted at Boston Medical Center. Candidates for a TOLAC, receiving prenatal care from nurse-midwives in 2012 and 2013, were enrolled before 28 weeks’ gestation. The women received 4 scripted counseling sessions during the routine prenatal visit, evidence-based information pamphlets, and an opportunity to review the hospital TOLAC consent form. Pre and post questionnaires were completed regarding birth preference, information sources, and decision factors. A midpoint assessment of the participants’ knowledge of risks and benefits of TOLAC versus ERCB was conducted, and satisfaction with the intervention and outcome were assessed after the birth. Results: Twenty-two women participated in the study, and 20 completed all study questionnaires. More of the participants believed they had enough information after the intervention (95% after intervention vs 70% before the intervention). Reasons for choosing ERCB included being afraid of vaginal birth complications, having prior positive experience with cesarean, and convenience of knowing when the neonate will be born. Reasons for choosing a TOLAC included the personal importance of having a vaginal birth and that recovery is faster and easier. Few women cited concerns for their own safety and that of their newborns when choosing TOLAC. Discussion: Women were satisfied with the scripted counseling and found it useful in helping them make a birth mode decision. While the scripted counseling did not appear to influence preferred mode of birth, it appeared to help women follow through with the mode of birth they chose prenatally.

        <ab>Introduction: Changes in sexual function can be difficult to capture, especially when an attempt is made to assess the effects of pregnancy or childbirth on the sexual function of first‐time mothers. Commonly used sexual function measures are limited and fail to account for pregnancy or birth in assessment of function. Aims: The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of the Sexual Function Questionnaire Medical Impact Scale (SFQ‐MIS) in assessing impact of childbirth on sexual function among first‐time mothers with infants aged one year or younger. Methods: A total of 255 women completed a cross‐sectional, web‐based survey. Exploratory factor analysis was utilized to assess the factor structure of the SFQ‐MIS scores in this sample. Variations in SFQ‐MIS scores based upon participant characteristics were conducted to further evaluate the SFQ‐MIS scores. Main Outcome Measures: SFQ‐MIS score was the primary measure of interest. Factors related to pregnancy and childbirth, such as mode of delivery, infant date of birth, last menstrual period, need for an episiotomy or perineal stitches, breastfeeding status, and score on the Perceived Stress Scale, were also assessed in order to further evaluate the validity and predictive capacity of the SFQ‐MIS. Results: Results indicated one factor that accounted for 58.27% of the variance in impact on sexual function due to childbirth. Cronbach's α coefficient for all five items was acceptable (0.82). Women who were breastfeeding (P &lt; 0.05), those who had received perineal stitches after a vaginal delivery (P &lt; 0.05), and those who reported no sexual activity in the past month (P &lt; 0.001) experienced significantly greater impact than those who were not breastfeeding, those who had not required stitches, and those who had been sexually active in the past month. Conclusion: The SFQ‐MIS appears to be a useful and valid indicator of changes in sexual function following childbirth, such as those related to arousal, desire, and orgasm.

        <ab>Background: A significant number of women experience childbirth as traumatic. These experiences are often characterized by a loss of control coupled with a perceived lack of support and inadequate communication with health care providers. Little is known about the choices women make in subsequent pregnancy(s) and birth(s), or why they make these choices. This study aimed to understand these choices and explore the reasons behind them. Methods: A longitudinal grounded theory methods study involving nine women was conducted. Over half of the participants had a formal diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or PND related to the previous birth. Interviews were carried out at three timepoints perinatally. These findings are from the first interviews at 12–20 weeks. Results: From the first days of pregnancy, this cohort of women were focused on concerns that this birth would be a repeated traumatic experience. The women were deliberately searching out and analyzing information about their choices in this pregnancy and birth, and making plans which had two aims; firstly to avoid a repeat of their previous birth experience and secondly to avoid a loss of control to other people during the birth. The women considered a range of birth choices, from elective cesareans to freebirth. Some women felt well supported by those around them, including care providers, partners, friends, and family. Others did not feel supported and were anticipating conflict in trying to assert their birth choices. Many early relationships with healthcare professionals were characterized by fear and mistrust. Discussion: If women who have previously experienced a traumatic birth become pregnant again, they have a strong desire to avoid a repeat experience and to feel in control of their birth choices. Access to robust information appears to help reduce uncertainty and arm women in their discussions with professionals. Similarly making plans and seeking to have them agreed with care providers at an early stage is used a way to reduce the risk of having a further traumatic experience. Implications for practice include supporting women in formulating and confirming pregnancy and birth plans at an early stage to reduce uncertainty and foster a sense of control.

        <ab>Objective: To determine whether clinical presentations and risk factor profiles differ between periventricular venous infarction (PVI) and arterial presumed perinatal ischemic stroke (APPIS). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Participants: A total of 59 children with presumed perinatal ischemic stroke (PPIS) from the SickKids Children’s Stroke Program who were carried to term (63% boys). Setting: Single tertiary care center subspecialty program. Interventions: Participants had validated magnetic resonance imaging classification to define PVI and APPIS subgroups. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical presentations, times to parental and physician concern, age at diagnosis, and standardized risk factor evaluations including maternal, fetal, obstetrical, neonatal, and prothrombotic variables. Patients with PVI and APPIS were compared using χ² or Fisher exact tests and Wilcoxon rank sum or Mann- Whitney U tests. Results: A total of 12 children (20%) had PVI and 47 (80%) had APPIS. Median parental concern was 5 months, with delays to physician concern (7 months) and diagnosis (12 months). Delays were longer in PVI cases compared with APPIS (P = .002). Most presented with asymmetrical motor development but children with APPIS were more likely to present with seizures or nonmotor delays (P = .01). Children with APPIS were more likely to have acute perinatal risk factors (66% vs 17%; P = .002) including fetal distress, emergency caesarian section, or neonatal resuscitation. Cardiac evaluations were unremarkable. Prothrombotic abnormalities were common (44%) including protein S deficiency, lupus anticoagulant, and elevated factor IX but were comparable between APPIS and PVI subgroups. Conclusions: Diagnosis of PPIS is often delayed. The association of acute perinatal risk factors with APPIS compared with PVI supports distinct timing of these diseases. Prospective, case-control risk factor studies of PPIS subtypes are required to develop prevention strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Despite heterogeneity among Pacific Islanders, most studies aggregate them regardless of origin. Thus, limited information is available about perinatal outcomes among various subgroups of Pacific Islanders in the United States, including immigrants from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We sought to evaluate perinatal outcomes among Marshallese women. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of women with at least one singleton live birth between 1997 and 2013 in two Arkansas counties using birth certificate data from the Arkansas Department of Health. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from modified Poisson regression models. Results: Of the 91,662 singleton births in both counties during the study period, 2488 were to Marshallese women. In adjusted analyses, Marshallese women had higher prevalence of 'other medical risk factors' (PR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.30, 1.65) than NH White women. Marshallese women had higher rates of precipitous labor and fetal distress during labor compared to NH White women (PR = 2.65; 95% CI 2.22, 3.17 and 1.89; 95% CI 1.62, 2.21, respectively). Marshallese were also more likely to have tocolysis (PR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.16, 1.76), forceps (PR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.16, 2.43) or vacuum (PR = 1.89; 95% CI 1.60, 2.22) used in delivery and cesarean section (PR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.01, 1.27). Marshallese infants had higher rates of anemia (PR = 3.10; 95% CI 2.01, 4.77), birth injury (PR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.50, 3.03), assisted ventilation &lt; 30 min (PR = 2.11; 95% CI 1.64, 2.71), preterm birth (PR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.50, 1.83), and small-for-gestational age (PR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.12, 1.39) than NH White infants. Conclusions: Marshallese women and infants had higher rates of adverse perinatal outcomes compared to their NH White counterparts. Additional studies are needed to determine if perinatal outcomes among the Marshallese differed from other Pacific Islander subgroups.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the relationship between depression and/or anxiety and any psychiatric diagnosis and readmission after childbirth. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of administrative data from patient discharge records. Setting: Urban academic medical center in the northeastern United States. Participants: Women admitted for childbirth (N = 17,905). Methods: Differences among participants with and without depression and/or anxiety present on admission were compared using t tests and chi-square tests. Risk-adjusted logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of depression and/or anxiety and any psychiatric diagnosis on 7-, 30-, 60-, 90-, and 180-day readmissions after childbirth. Results: Significant differences were noted between participants with (n = 1,169) and without (n = 16,736) depression and/or anxiety. Participants with these diagnoses had a higher mean age and a longer mean length of stay during hospitalization for childbirth. A greater proportion of these participants were White, were single, had cesarean births, and were discharged with home health services. The presence of depression and/or anxiety was not significantly associated with readmission. The effect of having any psychiatric diagnosis was significantly associated with a greater risk of readmission at 7 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, p = .100), 30 (OR = 1.45, p = .030), 60 (OR = 1.45, p = .026), 90 (OR = 1.56, p = .004), and 180 days (OR =1.74, p &lt; .001) following discharge after childbirth. Conclusion: In this sample, women with a psychiatric diagnosis, but not depression and/or anxiety alone, were at increased risk for readmission after childbirth.

        <ab>Comments on an article by S. M. Huberman et al. (see record [rid]2019-25374-001[/rid]). The authors performed a case–control study using analysis of patient charts with the intention to characterize the role of labor and delivery in the development of autistic spectrum disorders. They found a statistical correlation between cesarean delivery conducted under general anesthesia and later development of autism. The commenting authors note that the study design may lead to false conclusions, based on how the groups are selected. Thus, the results cannot support the conclusion of a causal relation.

        <ab>IMPORTANCE Because the rates of cesarean section (CS) are increasing worldwide, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the long-term effects that mode of delivery may have on child development. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between obstetric mode of delivery and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Perinatal factors and ASD diagnoses based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), were identified from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Swedish National Patient Register. We conducted stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to examine the effect of mode of delivery on ASD. We then used conditional logistic regression to perform a sibling design study, which consisted of sibling pairs discordant on ASD status. Analyses were adjusted for year of birth (ie, partially adjusted) and then fully adjusted for various perinatal and sociodemographic factors. The population-based cohort study consisted of all singleton live births in Sweden from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 2010. Children were followed up until first diagnosis of ASD, death, migration, or December 31, 2011 (end of study period), whichever came first. The full cohort consisted of 2 697 315 children and 28 290 cases of ASD. Sibling control analysis consisted of 13 411 sibling pairs. EXPOSURES Obstetric mode of delivery defined as unassisted vaginal delivery (VD), assisted VD, elective CS, and emergency CS (defined by before or after onset of labor). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ASD status as defined using codes from the ICD-9 (code 299) and ICD-10 (code F84). RESULTS In adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, elective CS (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95%CI, 1.15-1.27) and emergency CS (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95%CI, 1.10-1.20) were associated with ASD when compared with unassisted VD. In the sibling control analysis, elective CS was not associated with ASD in partially (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95%CI, 0.85-1.11) or fully adjusted (OR, 0.89; 95%CI, 0.76-1.04) models. Emergency CS was significantly associated with ASD in partially adjusted analysis (OR, 1.20; 95%CI, 1.06-1.36), but this effect disappeared in the fully adjusted model (OR, 0.97; 95%CI, 0.85-1.11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study confirms previous findings that children born by CS are approximately 20%more likely to be diagnosed as having ASD. However, the association did not persist when using sibling controls, implying that this association is due to familial confounding by genetic and/or environmental factors.

        <ab>Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between a mother’s current emotion regulation strategy (antecedent-focused vs. response-focused), her satisfaction with childbirth, and posttraumatic and/or depressive symptoms after unplanned C-section. Background: The mother’s and baby’s health is considered a priority during childbirth. As a result, situations in which an unplanned C-section is required may not allow mothers to express their needs and emotions. This may lead to feelings of dissatisfaction regarding the childbirth experience. Methods: Fifty French participants aged 18–35 (M = 27.10; S. D. = 3.99) who had a C-section were recruited on social networking groups and completed four self-report measures online, up to two years after childbirth. These measures assessed emotion regulation strategies currently used, birth satisfaction, postpartum depression symptoms and PTSD symptoms. Results: Main results indicate (1) Mothers who use expressive suppression, a response-focused strategy, are less satisfied with childbirth. (2) Emotion regulation, when combined with maternal satisfaction, shows a negative association with posttraumatic stress score and depression score. Conclusion: This study provides interesting data for further research. Follow-up studies about emotion regulation, postpartum depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms should be conducted in the future in order to provide clinical recommendations.

        <ab>Reports an error in 'Predicting risk for early breastfeeding cessation in Israel' by Zarina Paltiel Gabay, Kaboni Whitney Gondwe and Maxim Topaz (Maternal and Child Health Journal, Advanced Online Publication, Dec 2, 2021, np). The original version of this article contained a mistake. In the methods section, under sub-heading 'Study Design'—the text 'XXXX' should be replaced with the university name. The correct sentence is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-11994-001[/rid]). Objectives: This study aimed to 1) Examine factors associated with cessation of exclusive breastfeeding in Israel and 2) Develop predictive models to identify women at risk for early exclusive breastfeeding cessation. Methods: The study used data from longitudinal national representative infant nutrition survey in Israel (n = 2119 participants). Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors and build predictive models. Results: The rate of exclusive breastfeeding cessation increased from 45.4% at 2 months to 85.7% at 6 months. Five factors were significantly associated with higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding cessation at 2 months: being a primapara, low educational level, lack of previous breastfeeding experience, negative attitude towards birth, and lack of intention to breastfeed. Six factors were significantly associated with higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding cessation at 6 months: younger age, being in a relationship with a partner, lower religiosity level, cesarean delivery, not taking folic acid during pregnancy, and negative attitude towards birth. Both 2 and 6-months models had good predictive performance (C-statistic of .72 and .68, accordingly). Conclusions for Practice: This nationwide study successfully identified several predictors of exclusive breastfeeding cessation and created breastfeeding cessation prediction tools for two time periods (2 and 6 months). The resulting tools can be applied to identify women at risk for stopping exclusive breastfeeding in hospitals or at community clinics. Further studies should examine practical aspects of applying these tools in practice and explore whether applying those tools can lead to higher exclusive breastfeeding rates.

        <ab>Introduction: Birth-related perineal trauma (BPT) is a common consequence of vaginal births. When poorly managed, BPT can result in increased morbidity and mortality due to infections, haemorrhage, and incontinence. This review aims to collect data on rates of BPT in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: The following databases were searched: Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs), and the World Health Organization (WHO) regional databases, from 2004 to 2016. Cross-sectional data on the proportion of vaginal births that resulted in episiotomy, second degree tears or obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASI) were extracted from studies carried out in LMICs by two independent reviewers. Estimates were meta-analysed using a random effects model; results were presented by type of BPT, parity, and mode of birth. Results: Of the 1182 citations reviewed, 74 studies providing data on 334,054 births in 41 countries were included. Five studies reported outcomes of births in the community. In LMICs, the overall rates of BPT were 46% (95% CI 36–55%), 24% (95% CI 17–32%), and 1.4% (95% CI 1.2–1.7%) for episiotomies, second degree tears, and OASI, respectively. Studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to study design and population. The overall reporting quality was inadequate. Discussion: Compared to high-income settings, episiotomy rates are high in LMIC medical facilities. There is an urgent need to improve reporting of BPT in LMICs particularly with regards to births taking in community settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: There is limited evidence around childbearing women’s experience following a complicated birth requiring maternity high-dependency care. Our objective was to explore women’s experience and wellbeing following a complicated birth within this context. Research methodology/design: A cross-sectional study captured women’s experience through a postal survey four weeks post birth. Setting: A convenience sample of 112 women who received care in the first 24 hours of their stay in a Western Australian maternity high dependency unit. Main outcome measures: A validated tool designed to explore patients’ intensive care experience was modified and six items were added based upon the literature and in consultation with clinicians. Results: Women felt they were given choice (78%; n = 86); were not glad to be transferred to a ward (62%; n = 68) and were in pain during the first 24 hours of their admission (70%; n = 78). Women who did not feel scared were more likely than those who felt scared to have a clinician explain what had happened (95% vs 78%, P = 0.007); were more likely to feel in control (94% vs 75%, P = 0.006); and were less likely to feel helpless (27% vs 62%, P = &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The transfer experience to a postpartum ward requires further investigation as does the management of pain for these childbearing women regardless of their birth mode.

        <ab>Aim: To investigate pre- and postpartum levels of childbirth fear in a cohort of childbearing women and explore the relationship to birth outcomes. Background: While results are mixed, there is evidence that fear of childbirth is associated with mode of birth. Limited theoretical work around childbirth fear has been undertaken with Australian women. Design: A prospective correlation design. Method: Women (n = 401) completed the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) version A at 36 weeks gestation, with 243 (61%) women also completing version B at six weeks postpartum. Scores were summarised with means and standard deviations. Content analysis of the free statements identified nine issues of concern. Results. Twenty-six per cent of pregnant women reported low levels of childbirth fear, 48% were moderately fearful and 26% were highly fearful. Fear decreased after birth for those women in the high antenatal fear group, however surgical intervention at birth (n = 238, ANOVA, F1,230 = 12.39, p = 0.001) and suspected fetal compromise (F1,230 = 4.33, p = 0.039) increased levels of postpartum fear. Univariately, high antenatal fear was associated with emergency caesarean delivery (n = 324, Wald 5.05, p = 0.025) however after adjustment for nulliparity and fetal compromise the association disappeared. Australian-born women were more likely to report higher levels of fear and experience higher rates of caesarean section than participants of non-Australian origin. Conclusions: Results support those from earlier studies in showing that nulliparous women experience more fear than parous women before birth and that there is no difference in levels of postpartum fear between these two groups. Fear levels were higher in Australian women when compared to a Swedish sample. Relevance to clinical practice: The results of this study add to our preliminary understanding of the phenomena of childbirth fear within an Australian context and are particularly useful in profiling women for whom secondary fear of childbirth is more likely to occur.

        <ab>Childbirth is a major life event, but for some women, the fear of childbirth goes beyond trepidation towards full-blown anxiety and panic, known as fear of childbirth (FOC) or tokophobia. In the present study the authors investigated and compared the intrapersonal and interpersonal factors that might be associated with FOC among women who previously gave birth (parous) and women who did not. A cross sectional survey was conducted among 529 women (parous women (n = 365) and women who had never given birth (n = 173). All participants completed self-report measures using an online survey system. The questionnaires assessed intrapersonal factors including attitudes toward pregnancy and birth, body image, self-esteem and life satisfaction as well as interpersonal factors namely relationship satisfaction. Multiple regression analyses revealed that among parous women age and attitudes toward pregnancy and birth, especially those that relate to body image and delivery were significantly associated with FOC. Among women who had never given birth, only attitudes toward pregnancy and birth, especially those that relate to body image, importance of pregnancy and delivery, and preference of caesarean section (CS), were significantly associated with FOC. In both groups, satisfaction with spousal relationship was not found to be associated with FOC. The results indicate that regarding FOC, intra-personal factors are more dominant than inter-personal factors. When assessing this medico-psychological fear, cognitive aspects should also be addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Unhealthy toileting behaviours exist among women, and lower urinary tract symptoms have a high prevalence and significant effects on quality of life. However, the relationship between toileting behaviours and lower urinary tract symptoms is unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms among female nurses, and the association between toileting behaviours and lower urinary tract symptoms. Design: A cross-sectional stratified cluster sampling study. Participants: A total of 636 female clinical nurses from tertiary hospitals in Jinan (the capital city of Shandong Province, China). Methods: The Toileting Behaviour-Women’s Elimination Behaviours and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms scales were used to assess the participants’ toileting behaviours and lower urinary tract symptoms, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between toileting behaviours and lower urinary tract symptoms. Results: Unhealthy toileting behaviours were common among the female nurses, with delayed voiding being the unhealthiest toileting behaviour, which was followed by place and position preference for voiding. Nearly 68% of the female nurses had at least one lower urinary tract symptom, nearly 50% had incontinence symptoms, 40% had filling symptoms, and 18% had voiding symptoms. Unhealthy toileting behaviours (premature voiding, delayed voiding, and straining to void) were positively associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. However, lower urinary tract symptoms were not significantly associated with voiding place or position preference. Among the control variables, being married or having a history of a urinary tract infection was associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. Having a higher income and regular menstrual period were negatively associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. Compared with vaginal delivery, caesarean delivery had a protective association with lower urinary tract symptoms. Conclusion: Lower urinary tract symptoms among female nurses should not be overlooked, because their prevalence among female clinical nurses exceeded that among the general population of women. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding unhealthy toileting behaviours (especially premature voiding, delayed voiding, and straining to void), as these unhealthy toileting behaviours were significantly associated with susceptibility to lower urinary tract symptoms.

        <ab>Objective: To examine a possible association between maternal-request caesarean section (CS) and two intrapsychic psychoanalytic personality variables: object relations (OR) and unconscious defences. Background: While maternal-request CS is a growing phenomenon, studies are lacking regarding personality variables that may be associated with it. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire was conducted in one delivery ward. During 2009, 59 primigravida, healthy women were recruited; 28 who had requested and delivered by CS without an obstetrical indication and 31 who opted for a spontaneous vaginal delivery. Due to missing data for some measures, only 27 participants were analysed in each group. All women completed the fear of childbirth (FOC) questionnaire, and the object relations (SCORS) and unconscious defences (DMM) measures of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), as well as questionnaires assessing background variables. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and a logistic hierarchical multiple regression were performed. Results: Preliminary MANOVA showed significant differences between groups in age, FOC and use of the defence mechanism projection. Hence, these variables entered as predictors of maternal-request CS to a logistic hierarchical multiple regression model. The model was found to have a good fit [χ² (4) = 38.19, p &lt; 0.001]. Age, FOC and projection defence were found to be significant factors associated with maternal-request CS. Conclusion: Maternal-request CS was found to be strongly associated with age and FOC. Except for unconscious defence of projection, intrapsychic variables were not found to be associated with maternal -request CS. Possible implications are discussed.

        <ab>Reports an error in 'Changes in rates of inpatient postpartum long-acting reversible contraception and sterilization in the USA, 2012–2016' by David Sheyn and Kavita Shah Arora (Maternal and Child Health Journal, Advanced Online Publication, May 10, 2021, np). In the original article, there was a mistake in the supplementary file. The delivery DRG codes were incorrect in Supplementary Table 1. The Supplementary Table 1 is corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2021-45309-001[/rid]). Objectives To examine recent rates of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPM) of contraception use during delivery hospitalization and correlates of their use. Methods A retrospective cohort study utilizing the 2012–2016 National Inpatient Sample of hospitalizations in the United States of America. The International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to identify deliveries, inpatient long-acting reversible contraception (IPP LARC), and postpartum tubal ligation (PPTL). We conducted univariable and multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between demographic, clinical, hospital and geographical characteristics with likelihood of LAPM including IPP LARC and PPTL. Results Our sample included 3,642,328 unweighted deliveries. The rate of IPP LARC increased from 34.6 to 54.9 per 10,000 deliveries (58.7%), while the rate of PPTL utilization decreased from 719.5 to 671.8 per 10,000 deliveries (6.6%) over the study period. In multivariable analysis of LAPM utilization versus neither, cesarean delivery (aOR 7.25, 95% CI 7.08–7.43) was associated with greater utilization. Native American (aOR 4.01, 95% CI 2.91–5.53) race was associated with increased use of IPP LARC compared to a non-long-acting method of contraception. Age between 18 and 29 years (aOR 6.21, 95% CI 5.42–7.11) was associated with greater use of IPP LARC versus PPTL. Delivering in a rural hospital ((aOR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06–0.12) and cesarean delivery (aOR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06–0.12) were associated with greater use PPTL versus IPP LARC. Conclusions The IPP LARC rate remains at less than 10% the PPTL rates in our study timeframe. The demonstrated variation in uptake of highly effective methods of contraception inpatient after delivery offer possible opportunities for better understanding and improvement in access.

        <ab>Objective: Acute stress reactions (ASR) and postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS) are frequent after childbirth. The present study addresses the change and overlap of ASR and PDS from the 1- to 3-week postpartum and examines the interplay of caregiver support and subjective birth experience with regard to the development of ASR/PDS within a longitudinal path model. Method: A total of 219 mothers completed questionnaires about caregiver support and subjective birth experience (Salmon’s Item List) at 48–6-h postpartum. ASR and PDS were measured for 1- and 3-week postpartum. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to assess ASR, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess PDS. Results: ASR was frequent 1-week postpartum (44.7%) and declined till week 3 (24.8%, p &lt;.001), while the prevalence of PDS was continuous (14.2% week 1; 12.6% week 3; p = .380). Favorable reports of caregiver support were related to better subjective childbirth experience, which was related to lower ASR and PDS (controlled for age, mode of delivery, parity, EDA and duration of childbirth). Conclusion: High quality of intrapartum care and positive birth experiences facilitate psychological adjustment in the first 3-week postpartum.

        <ab>Aim: The study aimed to determine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among postpartum women in Zahedan city, Iran. Method: Data in this cross-sectional study were gathered from healthcare centres of Zahedan, a city in south-east Iran. Four-hundred women with childbirth experience over the past few months were selected; between 6 and 24 weeks had passed since their delivery. We used three questionnaires in order to evaluate the demographic data, PTSD symptoms and traumatic childbirth experience. Results: The mean parity was 3.40 ± 2.55 children and the mean duration of pain was 19.44 ± 9.16 hours. Overall, 7.8%, 36% and 0.5% of the subjects had a previous history of curettage, episiotomy and vacuum evacuation, respectively. In total, 32% of the participants showed PTSD symptoms. Prevalence of PTSD was not significantly associated with parity, pain duration, education level or employment status. Significant correlation with PTSD was found with the mode of delivery (P = 0.013), curettage (P = 0.005) and length of hospitalization. Also, prevalence of PTSD was substantially associated with the type of pregnancy (planned or unintended) (P = 0.011). Conclusion: Women with PTSD were not significantly different from those without PTSD in terms of parity, pain duration, education level or employment status. History of curettage, episiotomy and vacuum evacuation increased the incidence of PTSD in postpartum women. Moreover, unwanted pregnancy was more common among women with PTSD compared with normal subjects and length of hospitalization was longer.

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 23(2) of Journal of Sleep Research (see record [rid]2014-09856-016[/rid]). In the original article, there were two errors in the affiliations. The corrections are present in the erratum.] In a retrospective cohort study undertaken in 12 European countries, 249 female narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (n = 216) and without cataplexy (n = 33) completed a self‐administrated questionnaire regarding pregnancy and childbirth. The cohort was divided further into patients whose symptoms of narcolepsy started before or during pregnancy (308 pregnancies) and those in whom the first symptoms of narcolepsy appeared after delivery (106 pregnancies). Patients with narcolepsy during pregnancy were older during their first pregnancy (P &lt; 0.001) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) prior to pregnancy (P &lt; 0.01). Weight gain during pregnancy was higher in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (P &lt; 0.01). More patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy during pregnancy had impaired glucose metabolism and anaemia. Three patients experienced cataplexy during delivery. The rate of caesarean sections was higher in the narcolepsy–cataplexy group compared to the narcolepsy group (P &lt; 0.05). The mean birth weight and gestational age of neonates were within the normal range and did not differ across groups. Neonatal care was affected adversely by symptoms of narcolepsy in 60.1% of those with narcolepsy during pregnancy. This study reports more obstetric complications in patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy during pregnancy; however, these were not severe. This group also had a higher BMI and higher incidence of impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Caesarian section was conducted more frequently in narcolepsy–cataplexy patients, despite cataplexy being a rare event during delivery. Furthermore, symptoms of narcolepsy may render care of the infant more difficult. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>This study examines the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, sleep quality and unplanned Caesarean delivery. For this research, we adopted a prospective survey design and a sample of 200 women in the early stages of labour. The findings were as follows: (i) 11.5% of the participants underwent unplanned Caesarean sections; (ii) based on a Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index split point of 5, approximately 90.5% of the participants experienced poor sleep quality; and (iii) the odds ratio for primiparas undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section was 4.183 times that for multiparas (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.177 to 14.864), indicating a statistically significant difference. The results also showed that stress was a significant factor related to unplanned Caesarean sections; a 1-point increase on the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale was associated with a 1.033-fold higher probability of undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section (95% CI = 1.002 to 1.065). Furthermore, prenatal stress was a significant variable that can be used to predict unplanned Caesarean deliveries. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To determine the association of reported risk factors with hearing loss, and explore the possible contribution of other risk factors that may improve identifying Jordanian children for whom interventions should be provided. Design: A cross-sectional study was performed in 37 hospitals and mother-child clinics from different health sectors in Jordan. The hearing screening protocol was performed in three stages. Data collected as risk factors for infant hearing loss included those on the 2007 Joint Committee on Infant Hearing list as well as other factors believed to be possibly significant. Study sample: All babies born in or attending any of these hospitals or clinics were screened for hearing loss, which included a total of 63 041. Results: Of the 63 042 infants, 966 (1.5%) were confirmed to have significant hearing loss. We identified additional risk factors that were associated with hearing loss in infants. Conclusion: These preliminary data add to the understanding of the epidemiology of hearing loss in Jordan. The presence of at least one JCIH risk factor, admission to NICU for &gt; 5 days, age, birth weight, postnatal hypoxia, and mode of delivery were independently associated with hearing loss.

        <ab>Introduction: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among women living along the U.S.–Mexico border are approximately twice that of the general population of pregnant U.S. women. This study compared outcomes for Hispanic pregnant women diagnosed and treated for GDM (i.e., two abnormal 3-hour oral glucose tolerance tests [OGTT]) with those who were screened but had only one abnormal 3-hour OGTT and therefore received no treatment. Methods: Retrospective chart review of pregnant Hispanic women of Mexican origin (N = 95), with GDM (N = 41) or one abnormal 3-hour OGTT value (N = 54) who delivered between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups with regard to sociodemographic variables, hyperbilirubinemia, or other adverse neonatal outcomes. Comparisons identified differences between women with and without adverse neonatal outcomes concerned type of delivery; there were more C-sections among women with GDM. Conclusion: Pregnant women with one abnormal 3-hour OGTT value are at risk of giving birth to neonates with biomarkers similar to those diagnosed and treated for GDM. The treatment of hyperglycemia in Hispanic women of Mexican origin with one abnormal 3-hour OGTT value may improve the health outcomes and quality of life of the mother and the neonate. More research is warranted to clarify the risk of adverse outcomes of diverse pregnant women who do not meet guidelines for diagnosis of GDM.

        <ab>Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of maternal body mass index on intrapartum and neonatal outcomes at one of the largest maternity hospitals in Australia. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study of 55,352 term singleton deliveries at the Mater Mothers’ Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, was conducted. The study cohort was stratified into six groups based on the World Health Organization’s body mass index classification. The normal body mass index category was the reference group for all comparisons. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the effect of maternal body mass index, adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, parity, and preexisting conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus and hypertension), on selected intrapartum and neonatal outcomes. Results: Women in the overweight and Obese I, II, and III categories were more likely to have chronic or gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, and preexisting or gestational diabetes mellitus. They also had an increased risk for induction of labor, elective and emergency cesarean, and postpartum hemorrhage. Underweight women were less likely to require induction of labor and emergency cesarean. Infants born to women with increased body mass index were more likely to require neonatal resuscitation, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and have lower Apgar scores at 5 minutes. Conclusion: There is an increased risk of adverse intrapartum and neonatal outcomes for women who are overweight and obese, with the risks increasing with rising body mass index. Appropriately targeted weight management strategies and health education may yield improved maternal and perinatal outcomes if effectively implemented before pregnancy. These may particularly be of benefit in the teenage cohort that has yet to embark on pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: This study aimed to describe the perinatal outcomes of women opting for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) managed without induction or augmentation of labor. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of candidates for VBAC at a tertiary center in Japan from April 2003 to March 2012. Women with singleton gestations and one prior low-transverse cesarean delivery who intended VBAC at 36 weeks of gestation were identified as candidates for VBAC and included in the study. Participants were managed without induction or augmentation of labor. Maternal characteristics and perinatal outcomes were obtained from medical records. Factors associated with successful VBAC were analyzed with a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Of 333 candidates for VBAC, 242 (72.7%) had vaginal birth, 49 (14.7%) had repeat cesarean delivery with spontaneous labor, and 42 (12.6%) had repeat cesarean delivery without spontaneous labor. The rate of uterine rupture was 0.3% (1/333). Prior vaginal delivery and nonrecurring indications for prior cesarean delivery were associated with successful VBAC. Conclusions: Management of candidates for VBAC without induction or augmentation of labor resulted in a high VBAC rate and favorable perinatal outcomes. Such restrictive VBAC policies may be an acceptable alternative to standard management or abandonment of VBAC. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Breech presentation affects 3-4% of pregnancies at term and malpresentation is the primary indication for 10-15% of cesarean deliveries. External cephalic version is an effective intervention that can decrease the need for cesarean delivery; however, timely identification of breech presentation is required. We hypothesized that women with a fetus in a breech presentation that is diagnosed after 38 weeks’ estimated gestational age have a decreased likelihood of external cephalic version attempted and an increased likelihood of cesarean delivery. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. A chart review was performed for 251 women with breech presentation at term presenting to our tertiary referral university hospital for external cephalic version, cesarean for breech presentation, or vaginal breech delivery. Results: Vaginal delivery was significantly more likely (31.1% vs 12.5%; P &lt; .01) in women with breech presentation diagnosed before 38 weeks’ estimated gestational age as external cephalic version was offered, and subsequently attempted in a greater proportion of women diagnosed before 38 weeks. External cephalic version was more successful when performed by physicians with greater procedural volume during the 3.5 year period of the study (59.1% for providers performing at least 10 procedures vs 31.3% if performing fewer than 10 procedures, P &lt; .01). Conclusions: Results support the need for interventions to increase timely diagnosis of breech presentation as well as improved patient counseling and use of experienced providers for external cephalic version.

        <ab>Aim: Studies on the associations between mode of delivery and allergic diseases have produced different results, and research has rarely been conducted in Asian countries such as South Korea. This study assessed the relationship between mode of delivery and atopic dermatitis and asthma in Korean adolescents. Methods: Data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2010 and 2011 were used. We included 1302 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The odds ratio (OR) of having atopic dermatitis in adolescents born by Caesarean section compared with vaginal delivery was 1.50, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.01–2.22, after adjusting for age and sex. The association remained significant after further adjustments for body mass index, breastfeeding and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05–2.47) and when fat intake was added to those variables (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.14–2.85). However, asthma was not associated with mode of delivery in any of the models. Conclusions: Atopic dermatitis in adolescents was associated with Caesarean delivery, which is common in South Korea. The findings suggest that the frequency of this practice should be reconsidered and that further research with longitudinal evaluation of relevant mechanisms is needed.

        <ab>Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of a new model of antenatal care for women living in a very remote area. Design: This is a retrospective 2‐year evaluation of antenatal care. Setting and participants: Two hundred thirteen pregnant women in Aboriginal communities in the Fitzroy Valley of Western Australia participated in this study. Intervention: The implementation of a midwifery‐led interdisciplinary model of antenatal outreach care. Main outcome measures: The indicators measured were numbers of antenatal visits, their location and quality care indicators (presentation in first trimester, alcohol and smoking, ultrasound and blood‐borne virus screening) and outcome indicators (birth weight, prematurity, in utero deaths and mode of delivery). Results: There was an increase in access to antenatal care and improvements in quality‐of‐care indicators. The proportion of visits provided in local Aboriginal communities increased from 10% to 24%. There were statistically significant increases in women presenting in the first trimester (40–58%), screening for alcohol and smoking (48–93%) and having an ultrasound in pregnancy (59–94%). There were no significant improvements in neonatal outcome indicators. Conclusion: There is a large disparity in maternal and child health outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) and non‐Indigenous Australians thought to be due to decreased access to antenatal care, poorer socioeconomic status and the associated risk factors. The change in model of care resulted in earlier presentation for antenatal care, increased numbers of antenatal visits and increased screening for risk factors. Regular auditing of services enables the identification of opportunity for improvement with the goal of improving health outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: In The Netherlands, 35 percent of births take place in 'primary care' to women considered at low risk and during labor, approximately 30 percent are referred to 'secondary care.' High-risk women and some low-risk women deliver in secondary care. This study sought to compare planned place of birth and incidence of operative delivery among women at low risk of complications at the time of onset of labor. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of data about births in The Netherlands during 2003 that were recorded routinely in the Netherlands Perinatal Registry. Mode of delivery was analyzed for women classified as low risk at labor onset according to their planned place of birth (intention-to-treat analysis). The primary outcome was the rate of operative deliveries (vacuum or forceps extraction or cesarean section). Results: Women at low risk who planned to give birth, and therefore labored and delivered in secondary care, had a significantly higher rate of operative deliveries than women who began labor in primary care where they intended to give birth (18% [3,558/19,850] vs 9% [7,803/87,187]) (OR 2.25, 95%CI 2.00-2.52). For cesarean section, the rates were 12 percent (2,419/19,850) versus 3 percent (2,990/87,817) (OR 3.97, 95% CI 3.15-5.01), irrespective of parity. Conclusions: The rate of operative deliveries was significantly lower for low-risk pregnant women who gave birth in a primary care setting compared with similar women who planned birth in secondary care. As with any retrospective analysis, it was not possible to eliminate bias, such as possible differences between primary and secondary care in assignment of risk status. In addition, known risk factors for interventions, technologies such as induction of labor and fetal monitoring, are only available in secondary care. These findings clearly demonstrate the need for a prospective study to examine the relationship between planned place of birth and mode of delivery and neonatal and maternal outcomes.

        <ab>Objectives: To describe any rural–urban differences in child care providers’ (1) past training on the facilitation of child healthy eating and physical activity and (2) views relevant to the design of trainings. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2016 Healthy Start, Healthy State survey of Minnesota child care providers (rural, n = 232; urban, n = 386). Licensed family home-based care providers and providers working at licensed centers responded online or by mail to measures of desired training content, barriers, and delivery mode preferences. Results: Training barriers that were more often a concern for rural compared with urban providers included scheduling outside work hours, difficulties finding trainings, and travel (all P &lt; .001). Rural and urban providers identified similar preferences with regard to training content and delivery. Conclusions and Implications: The findings suggest it would be worthwhile for future research to examine whether rural providers’ training participation is affected by uniquely relevant participation barriers.

        <ab>Background: Little is known about the psychological status of partners of women with severe fear of childbirth (FOC). In this longitudinal study from Helsinki University Central Hospital, we investigated FOC, depression, and posttraumatic stress in the partners of women with severe FOC, and possible effects of group psychoeducation and mode of birth. Methods: During pregnancy, 250 partners of nulliparous women with severe FOC participated, 93 in the intervention group and 157 in the control group. At 3 months postpartum, 52 partners in the intervention group and 93 in the control group participated. Both the partners and the childbearing women filled in the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/ Experience Questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale mid-pregnancy as well as 3 months postpartum, when they also filled in the Traumatic Event Scale. Results: Partners of women with severe FOC reported less antenatal and postnatal FOC and fewer depressive symptoms than the childbearing women. No partner reached the threshold of severe FOC. No partner reported a possible posttraumatic stress disorder. Group psychoeducation with relaxation was not associated with better or worse psychological well-being of the partners. An emergency cesarean delivery was associated with a more fearful delivery experience in the partners. Conclusion: Partners of nulliparous women with severe FOC neither seem to suffer from severe FOC nor reported posttraumatic stress symptoms after childbirth. They reported better psychological well-being than the mothers both during pregnancy and after delivery. An unexpected cesarean may be a negative experience even for partners of childbearing women.

        <ab>Background: Most of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients undergo disease modifying drug (DMD) therapy at childbearing age. The objective of this prospective, collaborative study, was to assess outcomes of pregnancies fathered by MS patients undergoing DMD. Methods: Structured interviews on pregnancies fathered by MS patients gathered in the Italian Pregnancy Dataset were collected; pregnancies were divided according to father exposure or unexposure to DMD at time of procreation. Treatment were compared with multivariable logistic and linear models. Results: Seventy-eight pregnancies fathered by MS patients were tracked. Forty-five patients were taking DMD at time of conception (39 beta-interferons, 6 glatiramer acetate), while 33 pregnancies were unexposed to DMD. Seventy-five pregnancies ended in live-births, 44 in the exposed and 31 in the unexposed group. No significant differences between the two groups were found in the risk of spontaneous abortion or malformations (p &gt; 0.454), mean gestational age (p = 0.513), frequency of cesarean delivery (p = 0.644), birth weight (p = 0.821) and birth length (p = 0.649). In comparison with data of the Italian general population, the proportion of spontaneous abortion and caesarean delivery in exposed pregnancies fell within the estimates, while the proportion of pre-term delivery in the exposed group was higher than expected. Conclusions: Our data indicate no association between paternal DMD exposure at time of conception and risk of spontaneous abortion, adverse fetal outcomes and congenital malformations. Further studies clarifying the role of DMD fathers intake prior and during pregnancy are desirable, to supply guidelines for clinical practice.

        <ab>The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of personality factors and antenatal depressive symptomatology in postnatal depression. A prospective ex post facto design was carried out. The sample consisted of 116 women, recruited in their first trimester of pregnancy and followed up until four months postpartum. The measurement instruments used were the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to assess postpartum depression, the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) to analyse personality traits and the depression subscale of the Symptoms Check List 90 (SCL-90-R) to assess depressive symptomatology in the first half of pregnancy. Socio-demographic variables (age, parity, educational level, employment status, and planned pregnancy) and clinical variables (neonatal Apgar score and mode of delivery) were also taken into account. A positive correlation was found between postpartum depression and depressive symptomatology in the first trimester; however after the regression analysis neuroticism was the only factor that predicted postpartum depressive symptoms, explaining 24.8% of the variance. Neuroticism significantly influences psychological health during life events such as motherhood. Due to its stable condition, personality could be assessed from the beginning of pregnancy, contributing to the care of pregnant women with high scores in neuroticism, to prevent, detect and treat early postnatal depression.

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review in order to identify the risk factors for cerebral palsy (CP) in children born at term. The secondary aim was to ascertain if the potential for prevention of these risk factors has been adequately explored. Method: A MEDLINE search up to 31 July 2011 was completed, following the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Publications were reviewed to identify those with both a primary aim of identifying risk factors for all children or term-born children with CP and a cohort or case–control study design. Studies were examined for potential chance or systematic bias. The range of point estimates of relative risk is reported. Results: From 21 articles meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and at low risk of bias, data from 6297 children with CP and 3 804 791 children without CP were extracted. Ten risk factors for term-born infants were statistically significant in each study: placental abnormalities, major and minor birth defects, low birthweight, meconium aspiration, instrumental/emergency Caesarean delivery, birth asphyxia, neonatal seizures, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycaemia, and neonatal infections. Strategies for possible prevention currently exist for three of these. Interpretation: Ten consistent risk factors have been identified, some with potential for prevention. Efforts to prevent these risk factors to interrupt the pathway to CP should be extended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: In the Dutch maternity care system, primary care midwives provide care to low-risk women and refer to obstetricians if risks or complications occur. We examined reasons for referral, management of labor, and maternal and neonatal outcomes among women who were referred during labor. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, descriptive analyses were performed on data obtained from patient records. Six purposively chosen hospitals in The Netherlands participated in the study from June 2011 to February 2012. The study population included 600 pregnant women who were referred during labor from primary to secondary care. Main outcome measures: Reasons for referral, interventions after referral, mode of delivery, and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results: Of women who were referred during labor, three out of four women were referred for moderate risk indications: request for pain relief (30.5%), meconium-stained liquor (25.3%), failure to progress during first stage of labor (14.0%), and prolonged ruptured membranes without contractions (12.5%). Of all women, 65.7 percent had a spontaneous vaginal delivery and 59.7 percent received some kind of pain relief. Acute referral, meaning fetal distress, occurred in 5.5 percent. Of the newborns, 2.7 percent had an Apgar score of 7 or less after 5 minutes and 1.2 percent had an umbilical cord pH &lt; 7.05. Postpartum complications occurred among 11.0 percent of women. Conclusion: Women who are referred during labor have a high probability of spontaneous vaginal delivery. To improve continuity of care and satisfaction for this group of women, management of labor could be continued by trained primary care midwives.

        <ab>Background: Evidence used to guide the current Institute of Medicine (IOM) gestational weight gain (GWG) recommendations is largely derived from studies of European descent, and as such the guidelines are the same for all races and ethnicities. The guidelines are also the same for prepregnancy obesity classes I through III. Objective: Considering these literature gaps, we aim to (1) determine the association between the IOM GWG guidelines and three common pregnancy complications: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and cesarean delivery in a racially and ethnically diverse population; and (2) assess whether the association between GWG and pregnancy complications differs by race/ethnicity or prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) categories, particularly obesity classes I through III. Methods: To address these aims, we analyzed data from the Boston Birth Cohort. We calculated GWG using data from electronic medical records or, when missing, from a postdelivery questionnaire. We examined GWG continuously and categorically using the IOM formula. Results: Of the 5,568 women included, 54.5% met the IOM criterion for excessive GWG. Compared to women who had adequate GWG, women who gained excessive weight had 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27–2.14) times greater odds of preeclampsia; 1.68 (95% CI 1.15–2.46) times greater odds of gestational diabetes; and no significant change in odds of cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.14, 95% CI 0.99–1.31). Associations did not differ by race, ethnicity, or prepregnancy BMI categories including comparisons of obesity class I versus II or III (all p-values for interaction &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: In this racially and ethnically diverse population, excessive GWG was associated with higher odds of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and nonsignificantly, with cesarean delivery. Associations did not differ appreciably by race, ethnicity, or prepregnancy BMI categories. Our results support the relevance of the IOM GWG recommendations in racially and ethnically diverse populations, and in women in the higher prepregnancy obesity classes.

        <ab>Researchers have shown that some immigrant groups have an increased risk of emergency cesarean section. The authors' aim was to examine the differences in emergency cesarean section rates among immigrant women in Norway with low obstetric risks by using the Robson classification system. We performed secondary analysis on a Norwegian cohort study, where 10,125 women were classified in Robson groups one and three. Women from East, Southeast, and Central Asia, and from Africa had a higher risk of emergency cesarean section. The Robson classification system was a useful tool in comparing cesarean section rates between immigrant groups and host country populations.

        <ab>The fee exemption policy for EmONC in Mali aims to lower the financial barrier to care. The objective of the study was to evaluate the direct and indirect expenses associated with caesarean interventions performed in EmONC and the factors associated with these expenses. Data sampling followed the case control approach used in the large project (deceased and near-miss women). Our sample consisted of a total of 190 women who underwent caesarean interventions. Data were collected from the health workers and with a social approach by administering questionnaires to the persons who accompanied the woman. Household socioeconomic status was assessed using a wealth index constructed with a principal component analysis. The factors significantly associated with expenses were determined using multivariate linear regression analyses. Women in the Kayes region spent on average 77,017 FCFA (163 USD) for a caesarean episode in EmONC, of which 70 % was for treatment. Despite the caesarean fee exemption, 91 % of the women still paid for their treatment. The largest treatment-related direct expenses were for prescriptions, transfusion, antibiotics, and antihypertensive medication. Near-misses, women who presented a hemorrhage or an infection, and/or women living in rural areas spent significantly more than the others. Although abolishing fees of EmONC in Mali plays an important role in reducing maternal death by increasing access to caesarean sections, this paper shows that the fee policy did not benefit to all women. There are still barriers to EmONC access for women of the lowest socio-economic group. These included direct expenses for drugs prescription, treatment and indirect expenses for transport and food.

        <ab>Introduction: Immigrants from Western industrialized countries are rarely found in immigrant studies. Our primary objective was to calculate the rate of cesarean delivery, 5-min Apgar score &lt; 7, and preterm birth among Chinese and Western women. Our secondary objective was to examine whether there are significant differences in terms of risk factors between Western immigrants who chose to deliver in their country of citizenship compared to those who chose to deliver in China. Methods: Single-center retrospective cohort study in Shanghai, China. Multivariate logistic regression models used delivery outcome, and place of delivery (China vs. country of citizenship) as outcome variables. Results: Preterm birth occurred at a rate of 3.82% among Chinese citizens, 4.12% among Chinese-born Western citizens, and 6.54% among non-Chinese-born Western citizens. After adjustment, preterm birth &lt; 37 weeks was more frequent among non-Chinese-born Western citizens compared with Chinese citizens, with an odds ratio of 1.82 (Confidence Interval 1.20–2.78), p = 0.005. Variables statistically associated with giving birth in China were maternal age ≥ 35 years and being Chinese-born Western, as well as the absence of medical or obstetrical conditions. Discussion: Western immigrants have overall good obstetrical outcomes in China, and this could be partly explained by selective immigration, but also by the Salmon bias, as women with risk factors tend to return to their country of citizenship for the delivery. However, the preterm birth rate was higher among Western women than in their Chinese counterparts, and further research is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Palau and across the Pacific Islands is a serious public health issue that is currently understudied. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study that included 1730 women with a single live birth in Palau between January 2007 and December 2014. Results: The overall prevalence of GDM among women in Palau was 5.5%. Women who were older (≥ 30 years) or obese (BMI ≥ 30) were more likely to have GDM than women who were younger (&lt; 30 years) or non-obese (BMI &lt; 30), respectively. When adverse birth outcomes were assessed, women with GDM were found to have significantly higher prevalence of high birth weight infants, cesarean sections, and neonatal deaths when compared to women without GDM. In fact, women with GDM were five times more likely to have a neonatal death than women without GDM (p = 0.008). Conclusion: Reducing overall rates of obesity in the population could help reduce rates of diabetes and GDM in Palau. Based on this work, current practices for the identification, monitoring and treatment of women with GDM should be evaluated and strengthened in order to reduce neonatal mortality rates in Palau.

        <ab>Birth‐related outcomes, such as birth weight, have lifelong impacts on health. Home visiting (HV) is an established approach to improve the health of children and families, parenting practices, and connections to social and health services. Many HV programs target first‐time mothers, in part because HV activities related to a first‐birth may improve birth outcomes for subsequent children, but few researchers have examined these effects. We will link data from a statewide HV program (Nurturing Families Network [NFN]) to birth certificate data to create comparison groups and measure outcomes in this observational study. Specifically, we will compare birth outcomes for NFN second‐children (n = 3000) to those for: (a) first‐child older siblings whose birth/gestation led to NFN enrollment (n = 3000); (b) second children of families who were screened as eligible for NFN, but not offered the program due to home visitor availability and other logistical reasons (n = 650); and (c) non‐NFN second children in a propensity‐score‐matched group created using the likelihood of enrollment in NFN based on maternal health, demographics, and neighborhood characteristics (n = 6000). The outcomes we will examine are birth spacing, prenatal care received, cesarean section rate, gestational age, and birth weight in second‐children. We will also examine the associations between program attendance (i.e., missed visits, dropout) and birth outcomes, that will generate evidence that may be used in programmatic decisions regarding continued funding and/or modification of NFN, prioritization of specific retention efforts, and targeting of first‐time mothers. Use of this evidence should improve outcomes for future NFN families and may inform similar programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Impacts of delivery modes on the subsequent risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in pregnant women have not been elucidated. Materials and Methods: Data of women who had undergone cesarean delivery (CD cohort) or vaginal delivery (VD cohort) between January 2000 and December 2012 from Taiwan Health Insurance Database were analyzed. All subjects were tracked until December 31, 2013. For women with multiple deliveries, only the first delivery data were included. Study end point was the diagnosis of new-onset CHD after delivery. Results: In total, 51,765 subjects (CD cohort: n = 17,839; VD cohort: n = 33,926) were included. During 1–14 years of follow-up, the incidence rate of new-onset CHD in the CD cohort was significantly higher than in the VD cohort (1.3% [231/17,839] vs. 0.8% [257/33,926], p &lt; 0.001; effect size: 0.30). Analysis revealed that the subsequent risk of CHD in the CD cohort was significantly higher than in the VD cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.06–1.55, p = 0.012). We performed sensitivity tests by excluding subjects who had undergone CD due to nonmedical reasons from the CD cohort. The remaining subjects were named as the CD cohort. Analysis also revealed a higher subsequent risk of CHD in the CD cohort than in the VD cohort (adjusted HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.08–1.60, p = 0.006). Conclusions: Women who had undergone primary CD, especially those who had undergone CD due to medical reasons, were associated with an ∼30% higher risk of CHD than those who had undergone VD.

        <ab>Background: Antenatal care of women with epilepsy is varied. The association of epilepsy and antiepileptic drug exposure with pregnancy outcomes needs to be quantified to guide management. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between epilepsy and reproductive outcomes, with or without exposure to antiepileptic drugs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, AMED, and CINAHL between Jan 1, 1990, and Jan 21, 2015, with no language or regional restrictions, for observational studies of pregnant women with epilepsy, which assessed the risk of obstetric complications in the antenatal, intrapartum, or postnatal period, and any neonatal complications. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the methodological quality of the included studies, risk of bias in the selection and comparability of cohorts, and outcome. We assessed the odds of maternal and fetal complications (excluding congenital malformations) by comparing pregnant women with and without epilepsy and undertook subgroup analysis based on antiepileptic drug exposure in women with epilepsy. We summarised the association as odds ratio (OR; 95% CI) using random effects meta-analysis. The PROSPERO ID of this Systematic Review's protocol is CRD42014007547. Findings: Of 7050 citations identified, 38 studies from low-income and high-income countries met our inclusion criteria (39 articles including 2 837 325 pregnancies). Women with epilepsy versus those without (2 809 984 pregnancies) had increased odds of spontaneous miscarriage (OR 1·54, 95% CI 1·02–2·32; I² = 67%), antepartum haemorrhage (1·49, 1·01–2·20; I² = 37%), post-partum haemorrhage (1·29, 1·13–1·49; I² = 41%), hypertensive disorders (1·37, 1·21–1·55; I² = 23%), induction of labour (1·67, 1·31–2·11; I² = 64%), caesarean section (1·40, 1·23–1·58; I² = 66%), any preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks of gestation; 1·16, 1·01–1·34; I² = 64%), and fetal growth restriction (1·26, 1·20–1·33; I² = 1%). The odds of early preterm birth, gestational diabetes, fetal death or stillbirth, perinatal death, or admission to neonatal intensive care unit did not differ between women with epilepsy and those without the disorder. Interpretation: A small but significant association of epilepsy, exposure to antiepileptic drugs, and adverse outcomes exists in pregnancy. This increased risk should be taken into account when counselling women with epilepsy. Funding: EBM CONNECT Collaboration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Of 1,511 women served by nursing student birth doulas (Birth Companions) between 1998 and 2014, 34.5% were identified as vulnerable (refugees, non-English speakers, teens, low income, low education). This retrospective evaluation of the Birth Companions Program showed that vulnerable mothers had more epidurals and smaller babies, and attempted breastfeeding less frequently than nonvulnerable. There was no difference in the frequency of caesarean births, pitocin induction/augmentation, low birth weight, or preterm newborns among the vulnerable women. Birth Companion interventions may have a role in influencing these outcomes. The Birth Companions program will use this analysis to identify additional services for these populations.

        <ab>Objective: To determine the incidence, indications and outcomes of emergency peripartum hysterectomy (EPH) in three tertiary institutions in south-west Nigeria between January, 2010 and December , 2013. Methods: A retrospective review of all cases of EPH over a 4 year period was done. EPH was defined as hysterectomy performed at the time of delivery or within 24 h of delivery for uncontrollable postpartum bleeding not responsive to conservative measures. Relevant information was extracted from the hospital records and operation notes. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 17.0. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results: There were 102 EPHs performed among 39,738 deliveries within the study period, giving a rate of 2.6 per thousand deliveries. Indications were uterine rupture (44.1 %), uterine atony (37.3 %), morbidly adherent placenta (17.6 %) and extension of caesarean section incision involving the uterine arteries (1 %). Subtotal hysterectomy was performed in most cases (67.6 %).Maternal case fatality rate was 11.8 % and perinatal mortality rate was 55.9 %. Blood transfusion, severe postoperative anaemia, wound sepsis, febrile morbidity and acute kidney injury were common morbidities associated with the procedure. Following multivariate logistic regression, the unbooked status [odds-ratio 95 % CI = 12.80 (1.22–133.97) p = 0.03] was the only variable that significantly predicted maternal death. Conclusion: The incidence of EPH from our study is high. Much more needs to be done in maternal health services, particularly provision of quality obstetric care to reduce the rates of EPH and the associated high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

        <ab>Objective: The objective of this study was to compare adverse pregnancy outcomes between pregnancies that involve epilepsy and those that do not and are identified as normal for the purposes of this paper. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out by accessing the maternal–fetal medicine (MFM) database to identify and review records of singleton pregnancies with epilepsy but with no other underlying disease (study group). A parallel group of low-risk pregnancies was randomly allocated as the control group. The adverse outcomes between the two groups were compared. The primary outcomes included rates of spontaneous abortion, small for gestational age (SGA), preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and preeclampsia. Results: From a total of 44,708 deliveries, 148 pregnancies involving mothers with epilepsy and a control group of 1480 normal pregnancies were compared. The rates of spontaneous abortion, PTB, LBW, and cesarean section were slightly but significantly higher in the study group with a relative risk of 6.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9–23.3), 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1–2.2), 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1–2.3), and 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1–2.1), respectively, whereas other adverse outcomes were comparable. In the subgroup analysis, adverse outcomes tended to be higher in women with active epilepsy. However, only the rates of SGA in the group in which the disorder is active and PTB in the presence of seizures within 6months of conception were significantly increased. Conclusions: Pregnancies with epilepsy, even in cases with multidisciplinary care and no other risk factors, are still significantly associated with higher adverse outcomes.

        <ab>Aim: To compare absolute values of regional cerebral tissue oxygenation (cStO₂) during haemodynamic transition after birth and repeatability during steady state for two commercial near‐infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices. Methods: In a prospective observational study, the INVOS 5100C and FORE‐SIGHT were compared on 12 term newborns delivered by elective caesarean section. During the 10 min following umbilical cord clamping, cStO₂ was measured simultaneously with the neonatal sensors from each device. Repeated measurements were taken the following day. Results: Three and 8 min after clamping, the mean cStO₂ value increased from 53.4% (CI 36.8–69.9%) to 86.0% (CI 80.2–91.7%) for INVOS and from 61.6% (CI 55.4–67.8%) to 82.2% (CI 77.7–86.7%) for FORE‐SIGHT. The Bland–Altman plot revealed decreasing difference (INVOS minus FORE‐SIGHT) (D) in absolute values (A) with increasing cStO2 (D = 0.5A–38.19 p = &lt;0.001). The mean steady‐state value on day two was 78.4% (CI 74.6–82.2%) and 86.2% (CI 85.0–87.4%) for INVOS and FORE‐SIGHT, respectively. The within‐subject standard deviation during steady‐state repeated measurements was 4.8% ± 0.86 for INVOS and 2.8% ± 0.5 for FORE‐SIGHT. Conclusion: The INVOS and FORE‐SIGHT cStO₂ estimates showed oxygenation‐level‐dependent difference during birth transition. The better repeatability of FORE‐SIGHT could be due to the lower response to change in saturation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Coital urinary incontinence (CUI) is not much explored during clinical history, and this could lead to an underestimation of the problem. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical risk factors of CUI in women with urinary incontinence (UI), and to measure the impact of CUI on women’s sexuality and quality of life. Methods: This was a multicenter international study, conducted in Italy, Greece, the United States, and Egypt. Inclusion criteria were: sexually active women with UI and in a stable relationship for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria were: age &lt;18 years and unstable relationship. The UI was classified as stress UI (SUI), urgency UI (UUI), and mixed UI (MUI). Women completed a questionnaire on demographics and medical history, in particular on UI and possible CUI and the timing of its occurrence, and the impact of CUI on quality and frequency of their sexual life. Main Outcome Measures: To evaluate the CUI and its impact on sexual life we used the open questions on CUI as well as the International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaire and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition questionnaire. Results: In this study 1,041 women (age 52.4 ± 10.7 years) were included. In all, 53.8% of women had CUI: 8% at penetration, 35% during intercourse, 9% at orgasm, and 48% during a combination of these. Women with CUI at penetration had a higher prevalence of SUI, women with CUI during intercourse had higher prevalence of MUI with predominant SUI, and women with CUI at orgasm had higher prevalence of UUI and MUI with predominant UUI component. Previous hysterectomy was a risk factor for CUI during any phase, while cesarean delivery was a protective factor. Previous failed anti-UI surgery was a risk factor for CUI during penetration and intercourse, and body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2 was a risk factor for CUI at intercourse. According to International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaire scores, increased severity of UI positively correlated with CUI, and had a negative impact on the quality and frequency of sexual activity. Clinical Implications: This study should encourage physicians to evaluate the CUI; in fact, it is an underestimated clinical problem, but with a negative impact on quality of life. Strengths &amp; Limitations: The strength of this study is the large number of women enrolled, while the limitation is its observational design. Conclusion: CUI is a symptom that can affect sexual life and should be investigated during counseling in all patients who are referred to urogynecological centers.

        <ab>Aim: Few studies have reported on early life risk factors for motor development outcomes past childhood. Antenatal, perinatal and neonatal factors affecting motor development from late childhood to adolescence were explored. As sex differences in motor development have been previously reported, males and females were examined separately. Methods: Participants (n = 2868) were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort Study. Obstetric and neonatal data were examined to determine factors related to motor development at 10 (n = 1622), 14 (n = 1584) and 17 (n = 1221) years. The Neuromuscular Development Index (NDI) of the McCarron Assessment of Motor Development determined offspring motor proficiency. Linear mixed models were developed to allow for changes in motor development over time. Results: Maternal pre‐eclampsia, Caesarean section and low income were negatively related to male and female motor outcomes. Lower percentage of optimal birthweight was related to a lower male NDI. Younger maternal age, smoking during early pregnancy and stress during later pregnancy were related to lower female NDIs. Conclusion: Events experienced during pregnancy were related to motor development into late adolescence. Males and females were influenced differently by antenatal and perinatal risk factors; this may be due to sex‐specific developmental pathways.

        <ab>Despite the biological plausibility of an association between obstetric mode of delivery and psychosis in later life, studies to date have been inconclusive. We assessed the association between mode of delivery and later onset of psychosis in the offspring. A population-based cohort including data from the Swedish National Registers was used. All singleton live births between 1982 and 1995 were identified (n = 1 345 210) and followed-up to diagnosis at age 16 or later. Mode of delivery was categorized as: unassisted vaginal delivery (VD), assisted VD, elective Caesarean section (CS) (before onset of labor), and emergency CS (after onset of labor). Outcomes included any psychosis; nonaffective psychoses (including schizophrenia only) and affective psychoses (including bipolar disorder only and depression with psychosis only). Cox regression analysis was used reporting partially and fully adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sibling-matched Cox regression was performed to adjust for familial confounding factors. In the fully adjusted analyses, elective CS was significantly associated with any psychosis (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03, 1.24). Similar findings were found for nonaffective psychoses (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99, 1.29) and affective psychoses (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05, 1.31) (χ² for heterogeneity P = .69). In the sibling-matched Cox regression, this association disappeared (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78, 1.37). No association was found between assisted VD or emergency CS and psychosis. This study found that elective CS is associated with an increase in offspring psychosis. However, the association did not persist in the sibling-matched analysis, implying the association is likely due to familial confounding by unmeasured factors such as genetics or environment.

        <ab>Background: This retrospective study examined the enhancement of practice, knowledge, and skill of delivery suite midwives undertaking the circulating and instrument roles during emergent caesarean sections following a tailored educational program implemented to the benchmark standard. Method: All midwives who attended the educational program were invited to participate (N = 48); a total of 20 responses were received. Descriptive data analysis of the bivariate nominal data was performed. Results: Clinically significant outcomes were noted across all theme areas: knowledge of the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses standards, competence and knowledge of the main roles during a caesarean section, knowledge of policies and procedures, and patient safety. An improved working relationship between the perioperative and delivery ward staff also was identified. Conclusion: An educational program for midwives on the instrument and circulating roles for caesarean sections provides the knowledge and skill development required for clinically safe practice.

        <ab>Background: Prenatal mental disorders are associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, while few studies have been performed in mainland China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of maternal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy and provide scientific basis for reducing prenatal mental disorders. Methods: Data were obtained from 1220 women with &lt; 15 weeks gestation in a cohort study conducted in Chongqing, China. Prenatal stress, anxiety and depression were assessed using the pregnancy pressure scale, the Hamilton anxiety scale, and the self-rating depression scale, respectively. Results: The prevalence of prenatal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy was 91.86%, 15.04% and 5.19%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors for prenatal stress include housewife/unemployment, presence of anxiety and low- and moderate-level social support, besides, the protective factors were exercise, active smoking and no suggestion from parents. Housewife/unemployment, primiparity, presence of stress and depression and low-level social support were found to be associated with the development of anxiety symptoms, whereas exercise had a protective effect on it. Group-oriented personality, presence of anxiety, no suggestion from husband, low- and moderate-level family care, and low-level social support were risk factors for prenatal depression. Limitations: All participants were recruited from one region of China, and none of them have a history of cesarean section. Conclusion: Early screening and intervention may have great significance for reducing mental disorders of pregnant women, and the family and society support should be brought into the intervention as well.

        <ab>Background: There is converging evidence that between 1% and 3% of women develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childbirth. Various vulnerability and risk factors have been identified, including mode of birth and support during birth. However, little research has looked at the role of adult attachment style in how women respond to events during birth. This study prospectively examined the interaction between attachment style, mode of birth, and support in determining PTSD symptoms after birth. Method: A longitudinal study of women (n = 57) from the last trimester of pregnancy to three months postpartum. Women completed questionnaire measures of attachment style in pregnancy and measures of PTSD, support during birth, and mode of birth at three months postpartum. Results: Avoidant attachment style, operative birth (assisted vaginal or caesarean section) and poor support during birth were all significantly correlated with postnatal PTSD symptoms. Regression analyses showed that avoidant attachment style moderated the relationship between operative birth and PTSD symptoms, where women with avoidant attachment style who had operative deliveries were most at risk of PTSD symptoms. Limitations: The study was limited to white European, cohabiting, primiparous women. Future research is needed to see if these findings are replicated in larger samples and different sociodemographic groups. Conclusions: This study suggests avoidant attachment style may be a vulnerability factor for postpartum PTSD, particularly for women who have operative births. If replicated, clinical implications include the potential to screen for attachment style during pregnancy and tailor care during birth accordingly.

        <ab>The association between mode of delivery [specifically birth by Cesarean section (CS)] and induction of labor (IOL) psychological development at age 7 was assessed [including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and behavioral difficulties]. The Millennium cohort study, a nationally representative UK cohort of children (including 13,141 children), was used. There was no association between planned CS and ASD [aOR 0.58; (95 % CI 0.19–1.79)] or ADHD [aOR 0.54; (95 % CI 0.18–1.64)] analyses. Induced vaginal delivery was significantly associated with behavioral difficulties in unadjusted [OR 1.26; (95 % CI 1.03–1.54)], but not adjusted analysis [OR 1.15; (95 % CI 0.82–1.60)]. There was no association between mode of delivery and ASD or ADHD in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between mode of delivery and IOL and psychological development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Presents a case report of a 13 year old girl. V.E. was born at 37 weeks of gestation by caesarian section for membranes' premature rupture. Her weight at birth was 2850 g, height 48 cm, and Head Circumference (HC) 34 cm. Her familial anamnesis was negative for neuromuscular disorders and any other neurologic disorders. The peculiar findings of author's case are that the patient they described had a less severe course than other cases of muscle–eye–brain disease (MEB) since now reported in the literature, with unusual brain- MRI features for the disease, showing cortical gyration anomalies and cortical cerebellum multicystic degeneration, to their knowledge, never previously described in the literature. Recently a survey on clinical, radiological and genetic features of patients with MEB disease, caused by POMGNT1 mutation, has been published and from a cohort of 34 patients with CMD, 12 patients from 10 families were diagnosed with MEB disease. In these patients, authors found that the most common radiologic abnormalities were periventricular white matter abnormalities, ventriculomegaly, pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and multiple cerebellar cysts. All of the patients had mutations in the POMGNT1 gene. Author's concluded that MEB is caused by different mutations of POMGNT1 gene, some of which show a milder course, with peculiar clinical and radiological findings.

        <ab>Objective: To identify developmental trajectories of adiposity from birth until early adulthood, and to investigate how they relate with cardiometabolic risk factors at 21 years of age. Methods: Participants’ weight and height measurements were obtained using the EPITeen cohort protocol at 13, 17 and 21 years of age, and extracted from child health books as recorded during health routine evaluations since birth. Blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were assessed at 21 years. Trajectories were defined using 719 participants contributing 11 459 measurements. The individual growth curves were modelled using mixed-effects fractional polynomial, and the trajectories were estimated using normal mixture modelling for model-based clustering. Differences in cardiometabolic risk factors at 21 years according to adiposity trajectories were estimated through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and adjusted means are presented. Results: Two trajectories—‘Average body mass index (BMI) growth’ (80.7%) and ‘Higher BMI growth’ (19.3%)—were identified. Compared with those in ‘Average BMI growth’, ‘Higher BMI growth’ participants were more frequently delivered by caesarean section, mothers were younger and had higher BMI, and parental education was lower; and at 21 years showed higher adjusted mean systolic (111.6 vs 108.3mmHg, P &lt; 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (71.9 vs 68.4mmHg, P &lt; 0.001), and lower highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (53.3 vs 57.0 mg dl−1, P = 0.001). As there was a significant interaction between trajectories and sex, triglycerides and HOMA-IR were stratified by sex and we found significantly higher triglycerides, in males, and higher HOMA-IR in both sexes in ‘Higher BMI growth’ trajectory. All the differences were attenuated after adjustment for BMI at 21 years. Conclusions: In this long-term follow-up, we were able to identify two adiposity trajectories, statistically related to the BMI and cardiometabolic profile in adulthood. Our results also suggest that the impact of the adiposity trajectory on cardiometabolic profile is mediated by current BMI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: A large cohort study recently reported high pain scores after caesarean section (CS). The aim of this study was to analyse how pain after CS interferes with patients’ activities and to identify possible causes of insufficient pain treatment. Methods: We analysed pain scores, pain-related interferences (with movement, deep breathing, mood and sleep), analgesic techniques, analgesic consumption, adverse effects and the wish to have received more analgesics during the first 24 h after surgery. To better evaluate the severity of impairment by pain, the results of CS patients were compared with those of patients undergoing hysterectomy. Results: CS patients (n = 811) were compared with patients undergoing abdominal, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal or vaginal hysterectomy (n = 2406, from 54 hospitals). Pain intensity, wish for more analgesics and most interference outcomes were significantly worse after CS compared with hysterectomies. CS patients with spinal or general anaesthesia and without patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) received significantly less opioids on the ward (62% without any opioid) compared with patients with PCA (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with PCA reported pain-related interference with movement and deep breathing between 49% and 52% compared with patients without PCA (between 68% and 73%; p-values between 0.004 and 0.013; not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing). Conclusion: In daily clinical practice, pain after CS is much higher than previously thought. Pain management was insufficient compared with patients undergoing hysterectomy. Unfavourable outcome was mainly associated with low opioid administration after CS. Contradictory pain treatment guidelines for patients undergoing CS and for breastfeeding mothers might contribute to reluctance of opioid administration in CS patients.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate risk factors for poor self-rated health (SRH) in primiparous and multiparous women 2 months and 1 year after childbirth in a nationwide Swedish sample. Methods: Women were recruited at their first booking visit at 593 (97%) antenatal clinics in Sweden during 3 weeks evenly spread over 1 year (1999-2000). Data were collected by questionnaires in early pregnancy, 2 months and 1 year after childbirth, and from the Medical Birth Register. In total, 2424 women filled in all the questionnaires, including a global question on SRH. The representativity of the sample was assessed by comparison with the total Swedish birth cohort of 1999. Data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results: Physical problems, such as tiredness, musculoskeletal symptoms, and abdominal pain, and emotional problems, such as depressive symptoms, increased the risk of poor SRH in both primiparas and multiparas at one or both time points. Infant-related risk factors in both groups were negative experience of breastfeeding (2 months) and infant sleeping problems (1 year), and prematurity was a risk factor in primiparas at 2 months. Insufficient social support increased the risk in multiparas. In primiparas, outcome of labor, such as negative birth experience after operative delivery, was associated with poor SRH at 1 year and perineal pain at 2 months. Conclusions: A new mother's SRH is associated with her life situation. Ongoing physical and emotional problems, lack of support, and infant factors seem more important than sociodemographic background. Mode of delivery and childbirth experience may have a long-term effect on SRH. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: To expand the limited available knowledge about pregnancy and delivery in women with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) using a cohort of genetically proven SMA patients from USA. Methods: This was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. We mailed questionnaires to 58 women with confirmed SMA. Results: Thirty-two women responded, reporting 35 pregnancies, including 19 women with at least one pregnancy. In this cohort, preterm labor and delivery by cesarean section were more common in mothers with SMA particularly SMA type 2. Seventy-four percent of mothers reported increased weakness during pregnancy that persisted after delivery in 42%. SMA mothers generally had a positive experience and good outcomes and elected to have more than one pregnancy. Conclusion: This information regarding pregnancy in women with genetically confirmed 5q SMA will prove useful in guiding future research and in providing counseling to women with SMA.

        <ab>Objective: The association of cesarean section (CS) with the risk of postpartum depression (PPD) remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between CS and the risk of PPD. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases for relevant articles up to November 2016. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with fixed-effects model or random-effects model. Results: A total of 28 studies from 27 articles involving 532,630 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR of the association between CS and PPD risk was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.16–1.36). In subgroup analyses stratified by study design [cohort studies: (1.25, 95% CI: 1.10–1.41); case-control studies: (1.25, 95% CI: 1.00–1.56); cross-sectional studies: (1.44, 95% CI: 1.14–1.82)] and adjustment status of complications during pregnancy [adjusted for: (1.29, 95% CI: 1.12–1.48); not-adjusted for: (1.24, 95% CI: 1.13–1.36)], the abovementioned associations remained consistent. The pooled ORs of PPD were 1.15 (95% CI: 0.92–1.43) for elective cesarean section (ElCS) and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.33–1.62) for emergency cesarean section (EmCS). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that CS and EmCS increase the risk of PPD. Further evidence is needed to explore the associations between the specific types of CS and the risk of PPD.

        <ab>This research aims to determine the effect pregnancy Pilates-assisted childbirth preparation training for primiparous women has on the fear of childbirth and neonatal outcomes. Fear of childbirth is very common among women and has negative effects on the birth process and neonatal outcomes. The study was designed as quasi-experimental/non-randomised/quantitative and prospective. Primiparous women presenting to the antenatal clinic of a hospital between 27.2.2015 and 01.03.2016 constituted the study population (reached 149 women). The study sample included 108 women, 54 of whom were in the experimental group and 54 of whom were in the control group. The sample had agreed to participate in the study and had met the sample criteria. In collecting the data, the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire Version A, the birth outcomes data collection form were used. The data were analyzed using means calculation, Fisher’s Exact Test, Pearson’s Chi Square Test and T Test. The study found that the experimental group had a moderate level of childbirth fear prior to the training and a low level of childbirth fear following the training (p &lt; 0.05). The study was determined that the experimental group, as compared to the control group, was positively affected by the training, in terms of childbirth fear, mode of the birth, planned or unplanned cesarean birth, the Apgar score and body weight of the newborn, and problems in the development of the newborn, the first contact time with newborn, and the first time breastfeeding (p &lt; 0.05). The childbirth preparation program had a positive effect on fear of childbirth and neonatal outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Breastfeeding has many established health benefits for women and children. We examined the association between maternal education, newborn feeding in hospital, and long‐term breastfeeding duration. Methods We studied 3195 Canadian mother‐infant dyads in the CHILD pregnancy cohort. Newborn feeding was documented from hospital records. Caregivers reported sociodemographic factors and infant feeding at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Results: Overall, 97% of newborns initiated breastfeeding and 74% were exclusively breastfed in hospital. Exclusively breastfed newborns were ultimately breastfed longer compared with those who received formula supplementation during their hospital stay (median 11.0 vs 7.0 months, P &lt; .001). After controlling for maternal age, ethnicity, birth mode, and gestational age, exclusively breastfed newborns had a 21% reduced risk of breastfeeding cessation (HR = 0.79, 0.71‐0.87). This effect was strongest among women without a postsecondary education (HR = 0.65, 0.53‐0.79). Discussion: Exclusive breastfeeding in hospital is associated with longer breastfeeding duration, particularly among women of lower socioeconomic status. Initiatives that support exclusive breastfeeding of newborns in hospital could improve long‐term breastfeeding rates and help reduce health inequities arising in early life.

        <ab>Objective: Determine the impact of cesarean section (CS) on neonatal outcome of infants born at 23 weeks of gestation. Methods: A retrospective study was performed involving 34 infants born at 23 weeks and 91 infants born at 24–26 weeks. Indications necessitating delivery were severe pregnancy induced hypertension, non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns (NRFHRs), or intrauterine infection (IUI). Obstetrical indication for CS included NRFHR and breech presentation. Poor outcome included neonatal death or cerebral palsy. Univariate and multiple logistic analyses were performed to determine the effect of CS for obstetrical indications on poor outcome. Results: The incidence of poor outcome was significantly higher at 23 weeks (number of poor outcomes/total number: 22/34) compared to that (31/91) at 24–26 weeks (p &lt; 0.01). The incidence of a poor outcome was significantly higher at 23 weeks for infants having NRFHR (11/16) compared to those at 24–26 weeks (15/43, p = 0.02). However, the incidence of a poor outcome was similar in infants with IUI (6/10 at 23 weeks versus 5/11 at 24–26 weeks, p = 0.41). Vaginal birth in cases of obstetrical indication for CS at 23 weeks was associated with higher risk of a poor outcome(odds ratio: 8.2). In contrast, the risk at 24–26 weeks was not higher (OR, 0.8). After adjustment using variables of vaginal birth and IUI, vaginal birth significantly affected poor outcome (OR, 13.0). Conclusion: Poor neonatal outcome was closely related to the mode of delivery, suggesting that CS for obstetrical indication at 23 weeks may improve neonatal outcome.

        <ab>Objective: The prevalence of antenatal depression (AD) and associated risk factors among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Abeokuta North Local Government Area, Nigeria, was determined. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted, interviewing 314 pregnant women selected by multistage sampling technique from among those attending antenatal clinics. Information was collected using structured questionnaire and a screening tool, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), to assess probable depression. Results: The prevalence of antenatal depression was 24.5%. There were significant associations between antenatal depression and attending public health facility (P = 0.000), young maternal age (P = 0.012), single marital status (P = 0.010), not having formal education (P = 0.022), large family size (P = 0.029), planned pregnancy (P = 0.014), coexisting medical conditions (P = 0.034), history of previous caesarian section (P = 0.032), drinking alcohol during pregnancy (P = 0.004), and gender based abuse (P = 0.001). On health seeking behaviour for antenatal depression among depressed pregnant women, most, 68.9%, consulted their husbands about their symptoms; 57.3% took the decision to get treatment from doctors, and 52% sought prayer in the church. Conclusion: Antenatal depression is prevalent in this study population. Interventions to address its risk factors should be carried out and physicians should suspect depression in pregnant women reporting alcohol use and gender abuse.

        <ab>Objective: To determine (1) whether the risk of adverse neonatal and delivery outcomes differs between mothers with and without multiple sclerosis (MS) and (2) whether risk is differentially associated with clinical factors of MS. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the British Columbia (BC) MS Clinics’ database and the BC Perinatal Database Registry. Comparisons were made between births to women with MS (n = 432) and to a frequency-matched sample of women without MS (n = 2,975) from 1998 to 2009. Outcomes included gestational age, birth weight, assisted vaginal delivery, and Caesarean section. Clinical factors examined included age at MS onset, disease duration, and disability. Multivariate regression models adjusting for confounding factors were built for each outcome. Results: Babies born to MS mothers did not have a significantly different mean gestational age or birth weight compared to babies born to mothers without MS. MS was not significantly associated with assisted vaginal delivery (odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50–1.16; p = 0.20) or Caesarean section (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.69–1.28; p = 0.69). There was a slightly elevated risk of adverse delivery outcomes among MS mothers with greater levels of disability, although findings were not statistically significant. Disease duration and age at MS onset were not significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Interpretation: This study provides reassurance to MS patients that maternal MS is generally not associated with adverse neonatal and delivery outcomes. However, the suggestion of an increased risk with greater disability warrants further investigation; these women may require closer monitoring during pregnancy.

        <ab>Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of planned primary elective cesarean section versus planned vaginal delivery in women with advanced maternal age. Methods: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study using the United States’ Health Care Cost and Utilization Project’s Nationwide Inpatient Sample to evaluate maternal outcomes in women with advanced maternal age delivering from 2003 to 2012. Healthy women who underwent primary elective cesarean section constituted a surrogate for low-risk planned cesarean delivery. Logistic regression was used to compare outcomes between women with planned cesarean and planned vaginal delivery. Results: Among seven million births, we identified 442,067 deliveries in healthy women with advanced maternal age. The planned cesarean group comprised 7.96 % of women in the cohort. When compared to healthy women in the planned vaginal group, women in the planned cesarean group had a significantly higher mortality ratio (2.56/10,000 vs. 0.44/10,000, p &lt; 0.01). The planned cesarean group was also at higher odds of numerous complications, including peripartum hysterectomy OR 1.81 (1.36–2.40), p &lt; 0.01, cardiac arrest OR 5.39 (4.54–6.38), p &lt; 0.01, acute renal failure OR 3.39 (1.78–6.46), p &lt; 0.01 and sepsis OR 2.27 (1.25–4.14), p &lt; 0.01. Conclusions for Practice: Planned cesarean section is a key factor significantly influencing maternal morbidity and mortality in healthy women with advanced maternal age. When possible, planned cesarean deliveries should be avoided in this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background and purpose: Hormonal and mechanical factors might increase the risk for cervical artery dissection (CAD) during pregnancy and the puerperium. There is uncertainty how to counsel women with a previous CAD regarding the risk of CAD recurrence during pregnancy and the puerperium. Methods: In an observational study of four stroke centers, all women aged 16–45 years with primary CAD in the previous decade were asked to participate in a standardized assessment on long‐term follow‐up with a special focus on pregnancies and recurrent CAD. Results: Ninety‐two women were identified and 53 of them were included in the analysis (60%). Eleven women declined to participate, 28 were untraceable. The 39 non‐participants did not differ from participants regarding key baseline characteristics. Average follow‐up time was 72 months. Nine women (17%) had recurrent CAD after a median of 14 days (range 2 days to 117 months). Eleven women (20%) had a total of 13 completed pregnancies at a median of 44 months (range 12–84 months) after index CAD. Two of the pregnant women (18%) had suffered recurrent CAD ≥ 18 months prior to the pregnancy. All 13 pregnancies and puerperia went without recurrent CADs or cerebrovascular events. This includes giving birth by vaginal delivery (n = 6) and caesarean section (n = 7). None of the five women with typical connective tissue disease became pregnant. Conclusions: Our observation suggests that the risk of recurrent CAD may not be greatly increased with pregnancies starting at least 12 months after CAD in women without typical connective tissue disease.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the repeatability of maternal self-reported prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal factors within the IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) study. Design: Data are from the baseline survey of the longitudinal cohort study IDEFICS in eight European countries. Subjects: A total of 420 parents from eight countries (43-61 per country) were asked to complete the parental questionnaire (PQ) twice at least 1 month apart. Measurements: The PQ assesses prenatal (maternal weight gain), perinatal (child's birth weight and length, Caesarean (C)-section, week of delivery) and early postnatal factors (exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding, introduction of solid food). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to compare maternal reports on prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal factors between the first and second PQ. Results: In total, 249 data sets were considered for the analyses. Overall, maternal reports for prenatal and perinatal factors showed higher repeatability (ICC = 0.81-1.00, P ≤ 0.05 for all) than those for early infant nutrition (ICC = 0.33-0.88, P ≤ 0.05 for all). Perfect agreement was found for parental reports on C-section (ICCall = 1.00, P ≤ 0.05). There was stronger agreement for duration of breastfeeding (ICC = 0.71, P ≤ 0.05) compared with exclusive breastfeeding (ICC = 0.33, P ≤ 0.05). Maternal reports showed moderate correlation for the introduction of several types of food (cereals ICC = 0.64, P ≤ 0.05; fruits ICC = 0.70, P ≤ 0.05; meat ICC = 0.83, P ≤ 0.05; vegetables ICC = 0.75, P ≤ 0.05), and high correlation (ICC = 0.88, P ≤ 0.05) for cow's milk. Conclusion: Maternal reports on pregnancy and birth were highly reproducible, but parental recall of early infant nutrition was weaker and should be interpreted more cautiously.

        <ab>Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress has potentially negative and enduring consequences for the well-being of women and their families. Although research to date has identified attachment style and trauma history as individual risk factors, they have yet to be examined as integrative processes in the development and maintenance of childbirth-related post-traumatic stress. The current investigation aimed to examine whether attachment style may moderate the impact of a history of interpersonal trauma on initial levels and the rate of change in post-traumatic stress symptomatology across the first 6 months of the postpartum period. A large community sample of women were recruited from two Canadian urban hospitals. Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed longitudinally at 5 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months postpartum. Latent growth curve modeling (n = 251) revealed that attachment style moderated the impact of a history of interpersonal trauma on initial levels and the rate of change in post-traumatic stress symptomatology, while controlling for other well-established psychosocial (e.g., trait anxiety, previous psychopathology, lack of perceived support) and childbirth-related (e.g., mode of birth, labor pain, subjective experience) risk factors. More secure attachment conferred resiliency and more fearful attachment conferred vulnerability among women without a history of interpersonal trauma, while more preoccupied and more dismissing attachment conferred resiliency among women with a history of interpersonal trauma. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the integrative processes among risk and protective factors underlying the development of and ability to cope with childbirth-related post-traumatic stress. Attachment style and trauma history, which can be quickly measured, should be considered as targets in antenatal screening. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Although it is likely that childbearing among women with disabilities is increasing, no empirical data have been published on changes over time in the numbers of women with disabilities giving birth. Further, while it is known that women with disabilities are at increased risk of cesarean delivery, temporal trends in cesarean deliveries among women with disabilities have not been examined. Objective: To assess time trends in births by any mode and in primary cesarean deliveries among women with physical, sensory, or intellectual/developmental disabilities. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked vital records and hospital discharge data from all deliveries in California, 2000–2010 (n = 4,605,061). We identified women with potential disabilities using ICD-9 codes. We used descriptive statistics and visualizations to examine time patterns. Logistic regression analyses assessed the association between disability and primary cesarean delivery, stratified by year. Results: Among all women giving birth, the proportion with a disability increased from 0.27% in 2000 to 0.80% in 2010. Women with disabilities had significantly elevated odds of primary cesarean delivery in each year, but the magnitude of the odds ratio decreased over time from 2.60 (95% CI = 2.25 = 2.99) in 2000 to 1.66 (95% CI = 1.51–1.81) in 2010. Conclusion: Adequate clinician training is needed to address the perinatal care needs of the increasing numbers of women with disabilities giving birth. Continued efforts to understand cesarean delivery patterns and reasons for cesarean deliveries may help guide further reductions in proportions of cesarean deliveries among women with disabilities relative to women without disabilities.

        <ab>Comments on an article Induction of labor and cesarean delivery by gestational age by A. B. Caughey et al. (2006). There is the question of whether induced labors are more likely to lead to a cesarean delivery. In a given week, induction of labor approximately doubles the likelihood of cesarean delivery compared with spontaneous labor. More than 90% of multiparous women deliver vaginally regardless of the type of labor onset, but this is less true for nulliparous women. Because one cannot choose the week of spontaneous labor, in 2006, Caughey et al. published a 15- year retrospective review of deliveries from one institution in which they redefined the group to which induction at a given week was compared. Instead of women laboring spontaneously the same week as the induction group, they defined the comparison group as all those women not induced or entering spontaneous labor during that week, that is, an expectant management group of those still 'at risk' for cesarean delivery in coming weeks. Because the likelihood of labor induction increases with increasing gestational age, as does the probability of cesarean regardless of type of labor onset, the additive nature of this prospective approach leads to progressively higher cumulative risks of cesarean delivery in the expectant group, whereas cesarean risk following 39-week induction of labor remains constant. Using this 'at-risk' approach, Caughey et al. reported a higher cumulative risk of cesarean delivery in the expectant group of nulliparous women as compared with 39-week induction of labor.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the association of gestational age and mode of birth with early child development. Methods: Population-based record linkage cohort study was conducted among 153 730 live-born infants of ≥32 weeks’ gestation with developmental assessments at school age, in New South Wales, Australia, 2002 to 2007. Children were assessed in 5 domains: physical health and well-being, language and cognition, social competence, emotional maturity, and general knowledge and communication. Children scoring in the bottom 10% of national domains were considered developmentally vulnerable, and children developmentally vulnerable for ≥2 domains were classified as developmentally high risk (DHR), the primary outcome. Robust multivariable Poisson models were used to obtain individual and combined adjusted relative risks (aRRs) of gestational age and mode of birth for DHR children. Results: Overall, 9.6% of children were DHR. The aRR (95% confidence interval) of being DHR increased with decreasing gestational age (referent: 40 weeks); 32 to 33 weeks 1.25 (1.08–1.44), 34 to 36 weeks 1.26 (1.18–1.34), 37 weeks 1.17 (1.10–1.25), 38 weeks 1.06 (1.01–1.10), 39 weeks 0.98 (0.94–1.02), ≥41 weeks 0.99 (0.94–1.03), and for labor induction or prelabor cesarean delivery (planned birth; referent: vaginal birth after spontaneous labor), 1.07 (1.04–1.11). The combined aRR for planned birth was 1.26 (1.18–1.34) at 37 weeks and 1.13 (1.08–1.19) at 38 weeks. Conclusions: Early (at &lt;39 weeks) planned birth is associated with an elevated risk of poor child development at school age. The timing of planned birth is modifiable, and strategies to inform more judicious decision-making are needed to ensure optimal child health and development.

        <ab>High caesarean birth rates present an issue of international public health concern. We explore the prevalence and sociodemographic maternal factors associated with cesarean-section births among 272 mothers with children under 5 years old in an urban community of central India. In this population-based, cross-sectional study, we learned that the prevalence of cesarean section was unacceptably high and significantly higher in those deliveries that were either preterm/post-term, amongst mothers who had delivered at a private hospital, and among mothers with higher socioeconomic status. A third of the mothers reported lumbar back pain and almost 90% felt that the expenditure for cesarean sections is not reasonable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the influence of ethnic-cultural background and maternal body size on pregnancy outcomes in infants born at term. Study design: A retrospective cohort of 1,432 pregnant women who delivered a live newborn at term between 1999 and 2003 provided the data for the following study. We performed multivariable regression analyses for birth weight and rate of caesarean section controlling for body mass index (BMI), net weight gain, maternal age, parity, smoking, marital status and sex of infant. Results: Thirty percent of the women studied had a BMI ≥ 25; the proportion of mothers with a BMI ≥ 25 varied substantially by ethnic-cultural background (range: Far East 2.8% vs. Africa 50.0%). After adjustment for confounding variables, mothers from Sri Lanka and the Middle East had significantly lighter infants (Sri Lanka--145.5 g, 95% CI--59.3 g to 231.7 g, P = 0.001; Middle East--214.3 g, 95% CI--33.7 g to 395.0 g, P = 0.02) than mothers from Switzerland. Each unit increase in maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with a 20.3 g increase in birth weight (95% CI 14.3 g to 26.4 g, P &lt; 0.001). Muslim mothers from the former Yugoslavia had significantly lower odds of caesarean section than Swiss mothers (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96, P = 0.03). Conclusions: In this cohort, certain ethnic-cultural groups had increased odds for low birth weight and others had reduced odds of operative delivery compared with the Swiss comparison group. Given the strong association between ethnic-cultural background and overweight in this cohort, culturally appropriate support and counseling during prenatal care should be evaluated in the increasingly diverse environment in European countries.

        <ab>Reports an error in 'Mothers without companionship during childbirth: An analysis within the millennium cohort study' by Holly N. Essex and Kate E. Pickett (Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care, 2008[Dec], Vol 35[4], 266-276). We wish to correct the following errors: Page 273 Table 4 The p value for 'Emergency cesarean section' should read 0.1. The heading for column two should read 'OR or log odds ratios (95% CI)' rather than 'OR or RR (95% CI).' Page 274 The text that refers to the findings in Table 4, in relation to mode of delivery and pain relief, should read: 'Being unaccompanied at birth was a marginally significant risk factor for having an emergency cesarean section (p = 0.1) and for receiving a general anesthetic (p = 0.05), and was associated with a significant increased risk of having spinal pain relief anesthesia (p &lt; 0.05).' (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-16944-002[/rid]). Background: Studies have highlighted the benefits of social support during labor but no studies focused on women who choose to be unaccompanied or who have no companion available at birth. Our goals were, first, to identify characteristics of women who are unaccompanied at birth and compare these to those who had support and, second, to establish whether or not being unaccompanied at birth is a risk marker for adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Methods: The sample comprised 16,610 natural mother-infant pairs, excluding women with planned cesarean sections in the Millennium Cohort Study. Multivariable regression models were used to examine, first, sociodemographic, cultural, socioeconomic, and pregnancy characteristics in relation to being unaccompanied and, second, being unaccompanied at birth in relation to labor and delivery outcomes, maternal health and health-related behaviors, parenting, and infant health and development. Results: Mothers who were single (vs not single), multiparous (vs primiparous), of black or Pakistani ethnicity (vs white), from poor households (vs nonpoor), with low levels of education (vs high levels), and who did not attend antenatal classes (vs attenders) were at significantly higher risk of being unaccompanied at birth. Mothers unaccompanied at birth were more likely to have a preterm birth (vs term), an emergency cesarean section (vs spontaneous vaginal delivery) and spinal pain relief or a general anesthetic (vs no pain relief), a shorter labor, and lower satisfaction with life (vs high satisfaction) at 9 months postpartum. Their infants had significantly lower birth weight and were at higher risk of delayed gross motor development (vs normal development). Conclusions: Being unaccompanied at birth may be a useful marker of high-risk mothers and infants in need of additional support in the postpartum period and beyond.

        <ab>Background: Against a background of changing family structures and socioeconomic demands in contemporary families, fathers are more actively engaged in meal preparation and feeding of their children, yet in research studies targeting improvement in nutrition and feeding practices fathers are under-represented. Among possible explanations for this bias are acceptability of research projects and accessibility to male research participants. The aims of this study were to identify (i) fathers’ preferences for participation in child nutrition research and interventions and (ii) the potential to recruit fathers through their workplaces with the possibility of delivering interventions through those workplaces. Methods: This paper draws on two independent yet linked studies that explored fathers’ roles in family feeding, and intervention studies aimed at supporting father’s dietary knowledge and feeding practices. For Study 1 (conducted first) secondary data analysis was conducted on survey data (n = 463 fathers of preschool children) to determine preferences related to type of program, delivery mode, and location and timing. For Study 2 six focus groups and one individual interview were conducted with n = 28 fathers to determine acceptability of recruitment of fathers working in traditionally blue-collar occupations and service industries (as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics) and potential of intervention delivery through their workplaces. Results: Fathers were engaged in child feeding and indeed sought nutrition-related information. Fathers indicated a preference for family-focused and online delivery of interventions. Whilst potential to recruit through blue-collar workplaces was evident, participants were divided in their views about the acceptability of interventions conducted through the workplace. There was a sense of support for the logic of such interventions but the focus group participants in this study showed only modest enthusiasm for the idea. Conclusions: With limited support for the workplace as an intervention setting, further systematic exploration of technology-based intervention design and engagement is warranted. Based on findings, interventions should target a) content that is focused on the family and how to make changes at the family level, rather than the father individually; and b) online delivery, such as Apps or online video chat sessions, for convenience and to facilitate sharing of information with family members.

        <ab>Objectives: To evaluate use of combination neonatal prophylaxis (CNP) in infants at high risk for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in Europe and investigate whether CNP is more effective in preventing MTCT than single drug neonatal prophylaxis (SNP). Design: Individual patient-data meta-analysis across eight observational studies. Methods: Factors associated with CNP receipt and with MTCT were explored by logistic regression using data from nonbreastfed infants, born between 1996 and 2010 and at high risk for MTCT. Results: In 5285 mother–infant pairs, 1463 (27.7%) had no antenatal or intrapartum antiretroviral prophylaxis, 915 (17.3%) had only intrapartum prophylaxis and 2907 (55.0%) mothers had detectable delivery viral load despite receiving antenatal antiretroviral therapy. Any neonatal prophylaxis was administered to 4623 (87.5%) infants altogether; 1105 (23.9%) received CNP. Factors significantly associated with the receipt of CNP were later calendar birth year, no elective caesarean section, maternal CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl, maternal delivery viral load more than 1000 copies/ml, no antenatal antiretroviral therapy, receipt of intrapartum single-dose nevirapine and cohort. After adjustment, absence of neonatal prophylaxis was associated with higher risk of MTCT compared to neonatal prophylaxis [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.29; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.46–2.59; P &lt; 0.0001]. Further, there was no association between CNP and MTCT compared to SNP (aOR 1.41; 95% CI 0.97–2.5; P = 0.07). Conclusion: In this European population, CNP use is increasing and associated with presence of MTCT risk factors. The finding of no observed difference in MTCT risk between one drug and CNP may reflect residual confounding or the fact that CNP may be effective only in a subgroup of infants rather than the whole population of high-risk infants.

        <ab>Background: At 30 percent, British Columbia has the highest cesarean section rate in Canada. Little is known about the childbirth views and birthing preferences of college-aged women and men. The objectives of this study were to document (a) the prevalence of cesarean versus vaginal delivery as the preferred mode of delivery among nonpregnant university students without a history of childbirth, (b) the reasons for reported childbirth preferences, and (c) confidence in vaginal birth as a predictor of childbirth preference. Methods: A cohort of 3,680 male and female university students without a history of childbirth participated in an online survey of childbirth preferences. The study used a mixed methods approach (quantitative thematic analysis and logistic regression modeling). Prevalence of, and reasons for, preferred mode of delivery were analyzed separately for male and female respondents. Results: Most men and women responded that they preferred vaginal delivery, with 9 percent stating a preference for cesarean delivery. Reasons for preferred mode of delivery were similar for men and women. For women, confidence in vaginal birth emerged as a significant predictor of childbirth preference. Conclusions: Results indicate that a preference for cesarean section is linked to fear of childbirth and driven by low confidence in vaginal birth. Educational strategies targeting university-aged men and women may be helpful in alleviating fears of vaginal birth and providing evidence-based information about different birth options.

        <ab>Background: Research is yet to identify effective and safe interventions to increase the vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) rate. This research aimed to compare intended and actual VBAC rates before and after implementation of midwife-led antenatal care for women with one previous cesarean birth and no other risk factors in a large, tertiary maternity hospital in England. Methods: This was a retrospective, comparative cohort study. Data were collected from the medical records of women with one previous lower segment cesarean delivery and no other obstetric, medical, or psychological complications who gave birth at the hospital before (2008) and after (2011) the implementation of midwife-led antenatal care. Chi-squared analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio, and logistic regression to account for confounders. Results: Intended and actual VBAC rates were higher in 2011 compared with 2008: 90 percent vs. 77 percent, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.69 (1.48–4.87); and 61 percent vs. 47 percent, aOR 1.79 (1.17–2.75), respectively. Mean rates of unscheduled antenatal care sought via the delivery suite and inpatient admissions were lower in 2011 than 2008. Postnatal maternal and neonatal safety outcomes were similar between the two groups, except mean postnatal length of stay, which was shorter in 2011 compared with 2008 (2.67 vs. 3.15 days). Conclusions: Implementation of midwife-led antenatal care for women with one previous cesarean offers a safe and effective alternative to traditional obstetrician-led antenatal care, and is associated with increased rates of intended and actual VBAC.

        <ab>Objectives: To evaluate the effects of a multiple daily dose methadone regimen in pregnancy on neonatal outcomes. Methods: Although methadone maintenance has been the standard for the treatment of opioid dependence in pregnancy, there is no consensus on proper dosing. Single daily dosing is the most common strategy. Because of accelerated metabolism of methadone in pregnancy, this regimen may expose mother and fetus to daily episodes of withdrawal and possibly contribute to more severe Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). This study reports on a protocol that increased both methadone dose and dose frequency in response to maternal reports of withdrawal. Results: Treatment of NAS was needed in 29% of neonates, compared to a published rate of 60% to 80%. The mean methadone dose was 152 mg at delivery, divided into 2 to 6 doses per day. Ninety-two percent of mothers were free of illicit drug use at delivery. There was no relationship between methadone dose and treatment of NAS. Female babies had a treatment rate of 16% versus 38% for male babies. Beyond abstinence symptoms, cohort outcomes in terms of gestational age, birth weight, prematurity, Caesarian sections, and breastfeeding equaled or approximated US population norms. Conclusions: The protocol was associated with low-rates of treatment of NAS and high rates of maternal recovery. High rates of treatment for NAS reported inmethadone-exposed neonatesmight relate in part to iatrogenic factors and be reduced through the use of divided daily doses and protocols that minimize maternal withdrawal.

        <ab>Introduction: US data reveal a Caesarean rate discrepancy between insured and uninsured patients, with the C-section rate highest among the privately insured. The data have prompted concern that financial incentives associated with insurance status might influence American physicians’ decisions to perform Caesarean deliveries. Objective: To determine whether differences in medical risk factors account for the apparent Caesarean rate discrepancy between Medicaid and privately insured patients in Michigan, USA. Method: A retrospective review was performed of 617 269 live birth deliveries in Michigan hospitals during 2004-8. All live birth records that were able to be linked to their mothers’ hospital discharge records were utilised. Diagnosis-related group codes from the hospitalisation records were used to identify Caesarean deliveries. Regression models determined Caesarean probability for the time period under study, adjusted for insurance type, maternal age, race, maternal medical conditions, multiple births, prematurity and birth weight. Results: From 2004 to 2008, Caesarean rates were 33% for privately insured patients and 29% for Medicaid patients. The probability of Caesarean delivery was significantly greater for privately insured than Medicaid patients on univariate analysis (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.22) but not on multivariate analysis (adjusted OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.02). Conclusion: No significant disparity was found in the odds of Caesarean delivery between privately insured and Medicaid patients in Michigan after adjusting for other Caesarean risk factors. A positive disparity would have provided de facto evidence that financial incentives play a role in physician decision-making regarding Caesarean delivery.

        <ab>Aim: This study explored the childbirth expectations and knowledge of women who had experienced a caesarean and would prefer a vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Background: Vaginal birth after caesarean is considered best practice. However, in most western world countries, despite the inherent risks of caesarean for both mother and baby, the number of women labouring after a previous caesarean is declining. Methods: Newspaper advertisements were used to recruit Western Australian women who had experienced a caesarean. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview data collected from women who attempted a vaginal birth (n = 24), or stated they would choose this option, in a subsequent pregnancy (n = 11). Findings: For this cohort of women, their caesarean experience reinforced their previously held expectations about birthing naturally. The women held strong views about the importance of working with their bodies to achieve a vaginal birth, which was considered an integral part of being a woman and mother. Positive support from family and friends and a reluctance to undergo another caesarean was also influential. Women articulated the risks of caesarean and considered vaginal birth enhanced the health and well-being of the mother and baby, promoted maternal infant connection and the eased the transition to motherhood. Conclusion: This study documents how the importance of birth, as a significant life event, remained the focus of these women's childbirth expectations influencing future decisions on birth mode and mediating against the 'pressure' of medical discourse promoting caesarean. Relevance to clinical practice: Knowledge and appreciation of the multiple dimensions that contribute to women's decisions after a caesarean provides valuable information on which service providers and researchers can draw as they investigate interventions that enhance the uptake and success of women birthing vaginally after a caesarean.

        <ab>Importance: Perinatal complications may increase the risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous reports were based on small, retrospective, specialist clinic-based studies that were unable to rigorously control for unmeasured environmental and genetic confounding. Objective: To prospectively investigate a wide range of potential perinatal risk factors for OCD, controlling for unmeasured factors shared between siblings in the analyses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based birth cohort study included all 2421284 children from singleton births in Sweden from January 1, 1973, to December 31, 1996, who were followed up through December 31, 2013. From the 1403651 families in the cohort, differentially exposed siblings from the 743885 families with siblings were evaluated; of these, 11592 families included clusters of full siblings that were discordant for OCD. Analysis of the data was conducted from January, 26, 2015, to September, 5, 2016. Exposures: Perinatal data were collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and included maternal smoking during pregnancy, labor presentation, obstetric delivery, gestational age (for preterm birth), birth weight, birth weight in relation to gestational age, 5-minute Apgar score, and head circumference. Main Outcomes and Measures: Previously validated OCD codes (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, Tenth Revision, code F42) in the Swedish National Patient Register. Results: Of 2421284 individuals included in the cohort, 17305 persons were diagnosed with OCD. Of these, 7111 were men (41.1%). The mean (SD) age of individuals at first diagnosis of OCD was 23.4 (6.5) years. An increased risk for OCD remained after controlling for shared familial confounders and measured covariates (including sex, year of birth, maternal and paternal age at birth, and parity), for smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day during pregnancy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.58), breech presentation (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.71), delivery by cesarean section (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34), preterm birth (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43), birth weight 1501 to 2500 g (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.62) and 2501 to 3500 g (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16), being large for gestational age (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.45), and Apgar distress scores at 5 minutes (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07-2.09). Gestational age and birth weight followed inverse dose-response associations, whereby an increasingly higher risk for OCD was noted in children with a shorter gestational age and lower birth weight. We also observed a dose-response association between the number of perinatal events and increased OCD risk, with HRs ranging from 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) for 1 event to 1.51 (95% CI, 1.18-1.94) for 5 or more events. Conclusions and Relevance: A range of perinatal risk factors is associated with a higher risk for OCD independent of shared familial confounders, suggesting that perinatal risk factors may be in the causal pathway to OCD.

The correct title should read as follows: Effect of mode of birth on maternal and newborn outcome remains controversial. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-21560-010[/rid]). Comments on an article, 'Maternal and infant outcome after caesarean section without recorded medical indication: Findings from a Swedish case-control study' by A. Karlström, H. Lindgren and I. Hildingsson (2013). This study is one of a series of recent publications that attempt to sort out the impact of mode of birth on maternal and newborn outcome. The focus on elective cesarean section compared to planned vaginal birth beginning in spontaneous labor is an improved methodology over the earlier comparisons that failed to be able to separate planned from unplanned cesarean section or vaginal birth. The retrospective case control methodology based on birth record data that is employed in this research is similar to others, though with more respectable numbers. Most suffer from the problem of ascertainment difficulties, failure to stratify by parity, and of course, the unavailability of randomization, which some consider the ideal methodology.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes for treated and untreated bipolar disorder during pregnancy. Design: Population based cohort study using data from national health registers. Setting: Sweden. Participants: 332 137 women with a last menstrual period anytime after 1 July 2005 and giving birth anytime before the end of 31 December 2009. Women with a record of at least two bipolar diagnoses were identified and grouped as treated (n = 320)—those who had filled a prescription for mood stabilisers (lithium, antipsychotics, or anticonvulsants) during pregnancy—or untreated (n = 554). Both groups were compared with all other women giving birth (n = 331 263). Main outcome measures: Preterm birth, mode of labour initiation, gestational diabetes, infants born small or large for gestational age, neonatal morbidity, and congenital malformations. Results: Of the untreated women, 30.9% (n = 171) were induced or had a planned caesarean delivery compared with 20.7% (n = 68 533) without bipolar disorder (odds ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 1.90). The corresponding values for the treated women were 37.5% (n = 120) (2.12, 1.68 to 2.67). The risks of preterm birth in both treated and untreated women were increased by 50%. Of the untreated women, 3.9% (n = 542) had a microcephalic infant compared with 2.3% (324 844) of the women without bipolar disorder (1.68, 1.07 to 2.62). The corresponding values for the treated women were 3.3% (n = 311) (1.26, 0.67 to 2.37). Similar trends were observed for risks of infants being small for gestational age infants for weight and length. Among infants of untreated women, 4.3% (n = 24) had neonatal hypoglycaemia compared with 2.5% (n = 8302) among infants of women without bipolar disorder (1.51, 1.04 to 2.43), and 3.4% (n = 11) of the treated women (1.18, 0.64 to 2.16). The analyses of variation in outcomes did not support any significant differences between treated and untreated women. Conclusions: Bipolar disorder in women during pregnancy, whether treated or not, was associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

        <ab>Background: Antenatal care is an important component of maternity care. In many parts of the world, midwives are the primary caregivers for childbearing women, providing a high level of continuity of care during a normal pregnancy. While in China, obstetricians are the primary providers of antenatal care for all childbearing women; and midwives only provide intrapartum care to labouring women. Today midwifery as a profession in China has been marginalised. Pregnant women usually lack individualised continuity of care from midwives during the perinatal period. There have been few randomised controlled trials of midwifery care practice in mainland China. Objective: (1) To develop and implement a model of Chinese midwives’ antenatal clinic service and (2) to explore its effect on childbirth outcomes, psychological state and satisfaction, for primiparae. Design and methods: Two-group randomised controlled trial. One hundred and ten pregnant women were assessed for eligibility and invited to participate in either the intervention group (midwives’ antenatal clinic service) or the control group (routine antenatal care) in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan University from September 2011 to December 2011. Baseline data were collected, and then women were randomised to individual midwives’ antenatal clinic care (intervention group) or regular antenatal clinic service by obstetricians and obstetric nurse (control group). The research hypothesis was that compared with regular obstetrician-led antenatal care, the midwives’ antenatal clinic service would decrease the caesarean section rate, produce more favourable birth outcomes and women's greater satisfaction with care. Data were collected by retrospective review of case records and self-report questionnaires. The sample size of 110 was calculated to identify a decrease in caesarean birth from 70% to 40%. Birth outcomes, satisfaction and anxiety score in the two groups were compared. Setting: The midwives’ antenatal clinic in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Participants: 55 women, attending the midwives’ antenatal clinic (the intervention group) and 55 women, entering the control group. Results: Women in the intervention group were more likely than women in the control group to have a vaginal birth (35 [66.04%] versus 23 [43.40%]; 95% CI for difference 3.69–41.60). Women in the intervention group had a higher perinatal satisfaction but lower anxiety score than those in the control group. No differences were seen in neonatal Apgar score and in the amount of bleeding 2h post partum. Conclusion and implications for practice: The midwives’ antenatal clinic can decrease the rate of caesarean section and enhance women's satisfaction with midwifery care. Further research needs to be conducted to implement this model of care more widely. We will attempt to make midwifery care a true choice for Chinese women.

        <ab>Background: This study investigates maternal and perinatal outcomes for women with low‐risk pregnancies laboring in free‐standing birth centers compared with laboring in a hospital maternity unit in a large New Zealand health district. Methods: The study used observational data from 47 381 births to women with low‐risk pregnancies in South Auckland maternity facilities 2003‐2010. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for instrumental delivery, cesarean section, blood transfusion, neonatal unit admission, and perinatal mortality. Results: Labor in birth centers was associated with significantly lower rates of instrumental delivery, cesarean section and blood transfusion compared with labor in hospital. Neonatal unit admission rates were lower for infants of nulliparous women laboring in birth centers. Intrapartum and neonatal mortality rates for birth centers were low and were not significantly different from the hospital population. Transfers to hospital for labor and postnatal complications occurred in 39% of nulliparous and 9% of multiparous labors. Risk factors identified for transfer were nulliparity, advanced maternal age, and prolonged pregnancy ≥ 41 weeks’ gestation. Conclusions: Labor in South Auckland free‐standing birth centers was associated with significantly lower maternal intervention and complication rates than labor in the hospital maternity unit and was not associated with increased perinatal morbidity.

        <ab>Importance: To date, few attempts have been made to examine associations between exposure to maternal epilepsy with or without antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy and pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Objectives: To investigate associations between epilepsy in pregnancy and risks of pregnancy and perinatal outcomes as well as whether use of AEDs influenced risks. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based cohort study was conducted on all singleton births at 22 or more completed gestational weeks in Sweden from 1997 through 2011; of these, 1 424 279 were included in the sample. Information on AED exposure was available in the subset of offspring from July 1, 2005, to December 31, 2011. Data analysis was performed from October 1, 2016, to February 15, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pregnancy, delivery, and perinatal outcomes. Multivariable Poisson log-linear regression was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95%CIs, after adjusting for maternal age, country of origin, educational level, cohabitation with a partner, height, early pregnancy body mass index, smoking, year of delivery, maternal pregestational diabetes, hypertension, and psychiatric disorders. Results: Of the 1 429 652 births included in the sample, 5373 births were in 3586 women with epilepsy; mean (SD) age at first delivery of the epilepsy cohort was 30.54 (5.18) years. Compared with pregnancies of women without epilepsy, women with epilepsy were at increased risks of adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, including preeclampsia (aRR 1.24; 95%CI, 1.07-1.43), infection (aRR, 1.85; 95%CI, 1.43-2.29), placental abruption (aRR, 1.68; 95%CI, 1.18-2.38), induction (aRR, 1.31; 95%CI, 1.21-1.40), elective cesarean section (aRR, 1.58; 95%CI, 1.45-1.71), and emergency cesarean section (aRR, 1.09; 95%CI, 1.00-1.20). Infants of mothers with epilepsy were at increased risks of stillbirth (aRR, 1.55; 95%CI, 1.05-2.30), having both medically indicated (aRR, 1.24; 95%CI, 1.08-1.43) and spontaneous (aRR, 1.34; 95%CI, 1.20-1.53) preterm birth, being small for gestational age at birth (aRR, 1.25; 95%CI, 1.13-1.30), and having neonatal infections (aRR, 1.42; 95%CI, 1.17-1.73), any congenital malformation (aRR, 1.48; 95%CI, 1.35-1.62), major malformations (aRR, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.43-1.81), asphyxia-related complications (aRR, 1.75; 95%CI, 1.26-2.42), Apgar score of 4 to 6 at 5 minutes (aRR, 1.34; 95%CI, 1.03-1.76), Apgar score of 0 to 3 at 5 minutes (aRR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.62-3.61), neonatal hypoglycemia (aRR, 1.53; 95%CI, 1.34-1.75), and respiratory distress syndrome (aRR, 1.48; 95%CI, 1.30-1.68) compared with infants of unaffected women. In women with epilepsy, using AEDs during pregnancy did not increase the risks of pregnancy and perinatal complications, except for a higher rate of induction of labor (aRR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.10-1.55). Conclusions and Relevance: Epilepsy during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. However, AED use during pregnancy is generally not associated with adverse outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Most national guidelines for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Europe updated between 2001 and 2010 recommend vaginal deliveries for women with undetectable or very low viral load (VL). Our aim was to explore the impact of these new guidelines on the rates of vaginal deliveries among HIV-positive women in Europe. Methods: In a pooled analysis of data on HIV-positive pregnant women enrolled in the Swiss Mother &amp; Child HIV Cohort Study and the European Collaborative Study 2000 to 2010, deliveries were classified as occurring pre- or postpublication of national guidelines recommending vaginal delivery. Results: Overall, 2663 women with 3013 deliveries were included from 10 countries; 28% women were diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy. Combination antiretroviral therapy was used in most pregnancies (2020, 73%), starting during the first or second trimester in 78% and during the third trimester in 22%; in 25% pregnancies, the woman conceived on combination antiretroviral therapy. Overall, in 86% pregnancies, a VL &lt; 400 copies per milliliter was achieved before delivery. The proportion of vaginal deliveries increased from 17% (414/2377) before the change in guidelines to 52% (313/600) after; elective Caesarean section rates decreased from 65% to 27%. The proportion of women with undetectable VL having a Caesarean section was 55% after implementation of new guidelines. We observed a decrease of late preterm deliveries from 16% (377/2354) before to 7% (42/599) after the change in guidelines (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: There are still missed opportunities for women with HIV to fully suppress their VL and to deliver vaginally in Europe. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Examined whether depressive symptomatology in pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. In a prospective observational study, 959 women (aged 17–40 yrs) were followed up longitudinally from early pregnancy to postpartum. The level of depression was measured at baseline (1st antepartum visit) and in late pregnancy using the Beck Depression Inventory. Adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes were recorded at delivery. Depression in late pregnancy was associated with increased risk of epidural analgesia, operative deliveries (caesarean sections and instrumental vaginal deliveries), and admission to neonatal care unit. These effects remained significant even when controlled for potential confounders, such as antepartum complications. Previous studies (e.g., B. Zuckerman et al, 1989) have shown that antepartum anxiety or stress was associated with growth retardation, premature delivery, and epidural analgesia. These findings add to this body of evidence, which together suggest an adverse impact of antepartum psychological morbidity on maternal and neonatal well-being.

        <ab>Objective: Limited data are available that estimate the effect of gestational weight gain on maternal and neonatal outcomes in underweight women according to revised 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Methods: A population-based historical cohort study of 21,674 underweight women in Missouri delivering liveborn, singleton, term infants in 2002–2008 was conducted. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for gestational weight gain categories with multiple logistic regression, using the 2009 IOM recommended 28–40 pounds as the reference group. Results: Women gaining &gt;40 pounds compared to women gaining 28–40 pounds had significantly higher odds for preeclampsia (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.56–2.42, p &lt; 0.001), cesarean delivery (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.28–1.53, p &lt; 0.001), large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant (aOR 2.32, 95% CI 2.00–2.70, p &lt; 0.001), and 1 min APGAR score &lt;4 (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01–1.83, p &lt; 0.05) and significantly lower odds for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infant (aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.48–0.59, p &lt; 0.001). Women gaining &lt;28 pounds compared to women gaining 28–40 pounds had significantly higher odds for SGA infant (aOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.69–2.03, p &lt; 0.001) and significantly lower odds for preeclampsia (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53–0.96, p &lt; 0.05) and LGA infant (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39–0.63, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Women gaining more than the IOM recommendation were at higher risk for many adverse outcomes, but at lower risk for SGA infants. Women gaining less than the IOM recommendation were at higher risk for SGA infants but were protective for preeclampsia and LGA infants. Prospective studies of other short- and long-term maternal/infant outcomes are needed to evaluate the efficacy of the IOM guideline. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this prospective study was to examine the relationship between success of exclusive breastfeeding and postpartum depressive symptomatology. Our hypothesis was that mothers with depressive symptoms initially fail exclusive breastfeeding. Subjects and Methods: One hundred ninety-seven mothers were enrolled in the study. The participants were interviewed twice. The first visit was within the first 48 hours after birth. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was completed by the participants. The second interview was performed at 6 weeks. Participants answered questions regarding methods of breastfeeding for 6 weeks, any methodological problems, and nipple pain. The EPDS was again completed by the participants at 6 weeks. All newborns were term infants. Results: All the participants were divided into two groups: exclusive breastfeeding and mixed-feeding (partial breastfeeding and/or bottle feeding). Both groups were compared in terms of features, such as mode of delivery, parity, prevalence of depressive symptomatology (at 48 hours and 6 weeks), and delayed onset of lactation within the first 48 hours. Statistical significance was found for only three variables: delayed onset of lactation within the first 48 hours, gestational age, and the problems related to breastfeeding methods. Conclusions: Clinicians should pay special attention to any lactation difficulty during the first week postpartum. Early lactation difficulties are associated with greater risk of early termination of breastfeeding and lower breastfeeding success. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To describe facility-based decision-making for women with one prior cesarean delivery (CD) in a resource-limited setting and to characterize maternal and perinatal outcomes in these groups. Methods: One year retrospective study of women with one prior CD delivering at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH), Ghana. Women were categorized into three groups based on initial plan of management on admission [trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC), emergency repeat CD (EMCD) or non-emergent repeat CD (RCD)]. Characteristics and outcomes across these groups were then compared. Results: During the study period, 1247 women with one prior CD delivered at KBTH, of which 377 (30.2%) were triaged to RCD, 439 (35.2%) to EMCD and 431 (34.6%) to TOLAC. Twelve uterine ruptures and no maternal deaths occurred. Perinatal mortality was 4.2% (n = 52). Compared to the RCD group, the TOLAC group had a lower risk for maternal adverse events (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–1.0; p = 0.04) and non-significant higher risk of perinatal adverse events (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7–3.3; p = 0.25). Compared to women triaged to RCD, the EMCD group had a non-significant increase in risk of maternal adverse events (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8–3.5; p = 0.2) and a significantly higher rate of perinatal adverse events (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–4.9; p = 0.01). Conclusions for Practice: Women triaged to EMCD at admission are different when compared to women allowed a TOLAC or offered a non-emergent RCD. These women bear increased rates of adverse outcomes and should be considered as a separate group for analysis in future studies conducted in similar settings.

        <ab>Objective: This study assessed changes in anxiety during different phases of childbirth in a sample of women demanding epidural anesthesia. Design: Prospective, longitudinal case series. Sample: A total of 133 women who demanded epidural anesthesia for childbirth answered the questionnaires. Methods: Anxiety state was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire. The STAI-S (anxiety state) was administered in three phases during childbirth: Phase 1 was before applying epidural anesthesia, Phase 2 was 45 min after the application of epidural anesthesia and Phase 3 was at less than 24 h after delivery. Data were collected in two general hospitals: a third-level public hospital and a well-recognized private hospital.Main outcome measures: STAI scores. Results: Anxiety state decreases significantly after applying the epidural anesthesia (Phase 2) compared to before anesthesia (Phase 1), and it remains low levels 24 h after childbirth (Phase 3). There were statistically significant differences in STAI scores between the different phases administrated (Phases 1 and 2: p &lt; 0.001; effect size, d = 1.40; Phases 1 and 3: p &lt; 0.001; effect size, d = 1.39). In Phase 3, women with cesarean section birth had significant differences in STAI scores relative to those with spontaneous birth (p = 0.037; d = 0.44). The type of health-care setting (public or private), the educational level and the numbers of previous births does not affect the level of anxiety state in women in any of the three phases. Conclusions: Women’s anxiety decreases significantly after applying epidural anesthesia, and it remains low 24 h after delivery. Anxiety against childbirth was not influenced by the health system used by women, by the condition of primiparous or multiparous, or by the educational level. Women who received an epidural anesthesia with a cesarean section reported higher rates of anxiety state after birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Women who undergo cesarean birth might have an increased risk for poor mental health after childbirth, possibly because of maternal and neonatal physical problems, low parental confidence, and decreased levels of oxytocin. However, this relationship remains controversial and requires further examination. The study aimed to examine the effect of cesarean birth on postpartum stress, anxiety, and depression. Methods: This nationwide population-based cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. A total of 12 619 women who underwent cesarean birth and 12 619 control women who underwent vaginal birth were matched by propensity score based on age, socioeconomic status, residential urbanicity, antepartum comorbidity, and index year of delivery. We compared the incidence of stress, anxiety, and depression during the first postpartum year between cesarean and comparison groups by calculating incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Results: The cesarean group showed a significantly higher risk for stress symptoms (IRR 1.4 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.02-1.92]), but not anxiety (IRR 1.14 [95% CI 0.95-1.38]) or depression (IRR 1.32 [95% CI 0.94-1.87]), although the IRRs were also greater than one. The cesarean group had a significantly higher risk of any of the above-listed three disorders than the comparison group (incidence 27.6 vs 23.4 per 1000 person-years; IRR 1.18 [95% CI 1.01-1.38]). Conclusions: Cesarean birth was associated with an increased risk of postpartum stress symptoms. Health professionals should avoid unnecessary cesarean birth, pay attention to women who deliver by cesarean, and intervene appropriately in an attempt to improve mental health among postpartum women.

        <ab>Importance: Registry data show that maternal panic disorder, or anxiety disorders in general, increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, diagnoses from registries may be imprecise and may not consider potential confounding factors, such as treatment with medication and maternal substance use. Objective: To determine whether panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in pregnancy, or medications used to treat these conditions, are associated with adverse maternal or neonatal pregnancy outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study conducted between July 1, 2005, and July 14, 2009, recruited women at 137 obstetric practices in Connecticut and Massachusetts before 17 weeks of pregnancy and reassessed them at 28 (± 4) weeks of pregnancy and 8 (± 4) weeks postpartum. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined by answers to the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Assessments also gathered information on treatment with medications and confounding factors, such as substance use, previous adverse birth outcomes, and demographic factors. Exposure: Panic disorder, GAD, or use of benzodiazepines or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Among mothers: preterm birth, cesarean delivery, and hypertensive diseases of pregnancy. Among neonates: low birth weight, use of minor respiratory interventions, and use of ventilatory support. Results: Of the 2654 women in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 31.0 [5.7] years), most were non-Hispanic white (1957 [73.7%]), 98 had panic disorder, 252 had GAD, 67 were treated with a benzodiazepine, and 293 were treated with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor during pregnancy. In adjusted models, neither panic disorder nor GAD was associated with maternal or neonatal complications of interest. Most medication exposures occurred early in pregnancy. Maternal benzodiazepine use was associated with cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.36-4.40), low birth weight (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.61-7.26), and use of ventilatory support for the newborn (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.2-6.9). Maternal serotonin reuptake inhibitor use was associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.58-5.04), preterm birth (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02-2.38), and use of minor respiratory interventions (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.39-2.37). With maternal benzodiazepine treatment, rates of ventilatory support increased by 61 of 1000 neonates and duration of gestation was shortened by 3.6 days; with maternal serotonin reuptake inhibitor use, gestation was shortened by 1.8 days, 152 of 1000 additional newborns required minor respiratory interventions, and 53 of 1000 additional women experienced hypertensive diseases of pregnancy. Conclusions and Relevance: Panic disorder and GAD do not contribute to adverse pregnancy complications. Women may require treatment with medications during pregnancy, which can shorten the duration of gestation slightly. Maternal treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor is also associated with hypertensive disease of pregnancy and cesarean delivery.

        <ab>Background: The relationships between breastfeeding discontinuation and cesarean section delivery, and the occurrence of postpartum depression (PPD) remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of breastfeeding discontinuation and cesarean section delivery with PPD during the first 6 months after delivery. Methods: Data were extracted from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort for 81,447 women who delivered during 2004–2013. PPD status was determined using the diagnosis code at outpatient or inpatient visit during the 6-month postpartum period. Breastfeeding discontinuation and cesarean section delivery were identified from prescription of lactation suppression drugs and diagnosis, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios. Results: Of the 81,447 women, 666 (0.82%) had PPD. PPD risk was higher in women who discontinued breastfeeding than in those who continued breastfeeding (hazard ratio = 3.23, P &lt; 0.0001), in women with cesarean section delivery than in those with vaginal delivery (hazard ratio = 1.26, P = 0.0040), and in women with cesarean section delivery who discontinued breastfeeding than in those with vaginal delivery who continued breastfeeding (hazard ratio = 4.92, P &lt; 0.0001). Limitations: Study limitations include low PPD incidence; use of indirect indicators for PPD, breastfeeding discontinuation, and working status, which could introduce selection bias and errors due to miscoding; and potential lack of adjustment for important confounders. Conclusions: Breastfeeding discontinuation and cesarean section delivery were associated with PPD during the 6-month postpartum period. Our results support the implementation of breastfeeding promoting policies, and PPD screening and treatment programs during the early postpartum period.

        <ab>Although most developing countries monitor the proportion of births attended by skilled birth attendants (SBA), they lack information on the availability and performance of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) signal functions by different cadres of health care providers (HCPs). The World Health Organisation signal functions are set of key interventions that targets direct obstetric causes of maternal deaths. Seven signal functions are required for health facilities providing basic EmOC and nine for facilities providing comprehensive EmOC. Our objectives were to describe cadres of HCPs who are considered SBAs in Tanzania, the EmOC signal functions they perform and challenges associated with performance of EmOC signal functions. We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCPs offering maternity care services at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District in northern Tanzania. A questionnaire and health facility assessment forms were used to collect information from participants and health facilities. A total of 199 HCPs working at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District met the inclusion criteria. Out of 199, 158 participated, giving a response rate of 79.4 %. Ten cadres of HCPs were identified as conducting deliveries regardless of the level of health facilities. Most of the participants (81 %) considered themselves SBAs, although some were not considered SBAs by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW). Only two out of the eight facilities provided all of the required EmOC signal functions. While Assistant Medical Officers are expected to perform all the signal functions, only 38 % and 13 % had performed vacuum extraction or caesarean sections respectively. Very few registered and enrolled nurse-midwives had performed removal of retained products (22 %) or assisted vaginal delivery (24 and 11 %). Inadequate equipment and supplies, and lack of knowledge and skills in performing EmOC were two main challenges identified by health care providers in all the level of care. In the district, gaps existed between performance of EmOC signal functions by SBAs as expected by the MOHSW and the actual performance at health facilities. All basic EmOC facilities were not fully functional. Few health care providers performed all the basic EmOC signal functions. Competency-based in-service training of providers in EmOC and provision of enabling environment could improve performance of EmOC signal functions in the district.

        <ab>Foetal counselling is best achieved by a multidisciplinary team that can favourably influence the perinatal management of prenatally diagnosed anomalies and provide this information to prospective parents. Prenatal diagnosis has remarkably improved our understanding of surgically correctable congenital malformations. It has allowed us to influence the delivery of the baby, offer prenatal surgical management and discuss the options of termination of pregnancy for seriously handicapping or lethal conditions. Antenatal diagnosis has also defined an in utero mortality for some lesions such as diaphragmatic hernia and sacrococcygeal teratoma so that true outcomes can be measured. The limitation of in-utero diagnosis cannot be ignored. The aim of prenatal counselling is to provide information to prospective parents on foetal outcomes, possible interventions, appropriate setting, time and route of delivery and expected postnatal outcomes, immediate and long term.

        <ab>Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) against pregnant women and its relationship with adverse maternal outcomes, including preterm labour, abortion, caesarean section, antenatal hospitalization and vaginal bleeding, in the West Azerbaijan, Iran. Study design: Cross-sectional design. Methods: In total, 1300 pregnant women, aged 18–39 years, who were referred to hospitals in the Iranian cities of Miandoab and Mahabad in the province of West Azerbaijan in 2009–2010 were recruited for this study by a convenience sampling method. Participants were asked to share their experiences of IPV during pregnancy and adverse maternal outcomes. Results: Of these pregnant women, 945 (72.8%) reported that they had experienced IPV during their last pregnancy. A significant association was found between IPV and preterm labour [adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–2.03], caesarean section (adjOR 11.84, 95% CI 6.37–22.02), antenatal hospitalization (adjOR 6.34, 95% CI 3.82–10.52) and vaginal bleeding (adjOR 1.51, 95% CI 0.9–2.3). Discussion: This study demonstrated a high prevalence of IPV during pregnancy, and found that IPV was associated with adverse maternal outcomes including preterm labour, caesarean section, antenatal hospitalization and vaginal bleeding. This adds to the existing literature and can be used to inform healthcare practices in developing countries. Medical, health and surgical services for pregnant women should consider screening for IPV, and providers should be aware that IPV victims are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. Services should also develop links with the Battered Women's Movement; such programmes now exist in many countries. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: To examine the effect of inter-twin delivery interval on umbilical artery pH and Apgar score of the second twin after vaginal delivery of the first twin. Methods: Retrospective study conducted at a single teaching hospital. All pregnant women with twin gestation who delivered the first twin vaginally at more than 24 weeks between 1995 and 2015 were included. Major malformations and intrauterine deaths of one or both twins were excluded. Women were divided into those who had an inter-twin delivery interval of less than 30 minutes (group 1) or 30 minutes or more (group 2). Primary outcome was umbilical artery pH less than 7.1 and/or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes of the second twin. Generalized linear regression with log was performed to evaluate the association with delivery interval. Results: Of 88 145 deliveries during this period, 1955 (2.2%) were twins. Overall, 713 twin pregnancies, 596 (83.6%) in group 1 and 117 (16.4%) in group 2, were eligible and included. Mean inter-delivery interval was 11.0 ± 6.5 and 52.5 ± 31.5 minutes in groups 1 and 2, respectively. After adjusting for variables found significantly different between the groups in univariate analysis, inter-delivery interval of less than 30 minutes or 30 minutes or more was not a significant risk factor for pH less than 7.1 and/or Apgar less than 7 (P = .91). The cesarean rate for delivery of the second twin after vaginal delivery of the first twin was 4.3% overall, with a higher rate among group 2 compared with group 1 (18.2% and 3.2%, respectively; P = .001). Conclusions: The second twin’s Apgar score and cord artery pH are probably not affected when the inter-twin delivery interval exceeds 30 minutes.

        <ab>Maternal psychopathology is a risk factor for impaired mother-infant bonding, but not all women with this illness experience impaired bonding. This study investigated correlates of mother-infant bonding among 180 postpartum women treated in a psychiatric partial hospitalization program. Women completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms and mother-infant bonding, and a retrospective chart review assessed demographic characteristics, clinician-rated diagnoses, and obstetric factors. Symptoms of depression, self-reported suicidality, demographic characteristics, and mode of delivery were significantly associated with impaired bonding.

        <ab>In recent years, there have been changes in the approach to maternal psychiatric disorders and their effects on the fetus, with the focus redirected to the search for biological markers. Neurotrophic factors and inflammatory processes have received particular attention in the past few years. According to the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the study sample (n = 136) consisted of three groups: mothers with major depressive disorder (MDD group, n = 25), mothers with anxiety disorder (AD group, n = 18), and mothers without any psychiatric disorders (not diagnosed (ND) group, n = 93). During the delivery/cesarean section, a blood sample was obtained from the umbilical cord. Serum concentrations of BDNF, NT-3, FGF2, TNF-α, and neopterin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Clinical and biochemical characteristics were assessed. We did not find a significant difference among the three study groups with regard to BDNF, NT-3, and TNF-α levels. The ANOVA test indicated statistically significant differences in FGF2 levels and neopterin between the study groups. The newborns of mothers with AD had significantly higher FGF2 levels and significantly higher neopterin levels when compared with those of mothers with MDD and healthy mothers. The present study sheds light on the effects of higher FGF2 and neopterin levels in fetuses exposed to AD. Our results should be replicated through further prospective studies with a larger sample size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To explore how childbirth self-efficacy, i.e. outcome expectancy and efficacy expectancy, was associated with fear of childbirth (FOC) and how efficacy expectancy and FOC, respectively were related to socio-demographic characteristics, mental problems and preference for a caesarean section. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a consecutive sample of 1000 pregnant nulliparous women was sent the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire and Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory. Statistical analyses were performed on data from 423 women. Results: Outcome expectancy and efficacy expectancy correlated significantly and positively, FOC correlated significantly and negatively with both outcome expectancy and efficacy expectancy. Women with severe FOC (20.8%) had a significantly lower level of education (p = 0.001), and had more often sought help because of mental problems (p = .004). They were more likely to have low-efficacy expectancy (p &lt; 0.001) and to prefer a caesarean section instead of a vaginal birth (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Lower efficacy expectancy was associated with higher FOC while preference for a caesarean section was not. Improvement of self-efficacy could be a part of care for women with FOC during pregnancy; however, it would not be enough for fearful women who wish to have a caesarean section.

        <ab>Objective: This study examined the inequality in cesarean section (CS) utilization and its socio-economic contributors. Study design: Retrospective two-stage stratified sample design. Methods: Data were extracted from two rounds of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2004 and 2014. Concentration Index of CS utilization was calculated using the wealth quintile. Regression-based decomposition method was applied to assess the socio-economic contributors of inequality in CS utilization. Results: The rate of CS utilization increased from 4.98% in 2004 to 24.21% in 2014. The utilization of CS was highly concentrated among the women of higher socio-economic status (SES) in both rounds of the survey. Results of the decomposition models revealed wealth quintile, higher education, higher number of antenatal visits, and being overweight or obese as the critical factors contributing to the inequalities of CS utilization. Conclusion: Bangladesh is now observing a rapid rise in CS utilization and women with higher SES are the main client group of this life saving procedure. There may have inadequate access for those who are relatively less advantaged, even when CS is necessary. Strong initiative from the government is necessary to ensure proper access to this service regardless of women's SES. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background and Aims: The inhibitory pathways that play a role in spinal modulation include local interneurons and descending control. Clinical data regarding the role of these pathways in acute pain is lacking. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of noradrenaline, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine in parturients with labor pain compared to those without labor pain. Methods: One hundred term uncomplicated pregnant women receiving spinal anesthesia for cesarean section were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. CSF noradrenaline, serotonin, GABA, and glycine levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Labor pain score was assessed by numerical rating scale. Results: Median CSF serotonin concentration in parturients with labor pain was significantly lower than in those without pain (p &lt; 0.001).Median CSF glycine level in the labor pain group was significantly higher than in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in median CSF level of noradrenaline or GABA between parturients with and without labor pain. Subsequent analysis showed labor pain scores to be negatively correlated with CSF serotonin (r = −0.217, p = 0.04) but positively correlated with CSF glycine (r = 0.415, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion. CSF serotonin and glycine were significantly correlated with labor pain scores.These findings suggest that the serotonergic and glycinergic systems may play a role in spinal modulation of visceral pain.

        <ab>Objective: The goal of this analysis was to examine the effect of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes in a cohort of women with psychiatric disorders. Methods: 794 evaluable women from the Massachusetts General Hospital National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications were followed across pregnancy (N = 144 exposed to benzodiazepines and N = 650 unexposed). Data obtained through maternal report and medical records included maternal outcomes (cesarean section, preeclampsia) and neonatal outcomes (birth weight, breathing difficulty, feeding difficulty, head circumference, 5-minute Apgar score, muscular and/or extrapyramidal symptoms, NICU admission, prematurity). Results: In adjusted analyses, infants exposed to benzodiazepines in utero were more likely to be admitted to the NICU (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.66) and to have small head circumferences (OR: 3.89, 95% CI: 1.25, 12.03) compared to unexposed infants. Other neonatal adverse effects such as respiratory distress or muscular symptoms including hypotonia were not observed. There were no significant differences in adverse obstetrical outcomes. Conclusions: Infants exposed to benzodiazepines during pregnancy had an increased risk of NICU admissions and small head circumferences. Confounding from psychiatric symptoms and other variables cannot be ruled out as contributors to these findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Adverse perinatal events may increase the risk of Tourette’s and chronic tic disorders (TD/CTD), but previous studies have been unable to control for unmeasured environmental and genetic confounding. We aimed to prospectively investigate potential perinatal risk factors for TD/CTD, taking unmeasured factors shared between full siblings into account. A population-based birth cohort, consisting of all singletons born in Sweden in 1973–2003, was followed until December 2013. A total of 3 026 861 individuals were identified, 5597 of which had a registered TD/CTD diagnosis. We then studied differentially exposed full siblings from 947 942 families; of these, 3563 families included siblings that were discordant for TD/CTD. Perinatal data were collected from the Medical Birth Register and TD/CTD diagnoses were collected from the National Patient Register, using a previously validated algorithm. In the fully adjusted models, impaired fetal growth, preterm birth, breech presentation and cesarean section were associated with a higher risk of TD/CTD, largely independent from shared family confounders and measured covariates. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with risk of TD/CTD in a dose–response manner but the association was no longer statistically significant in the sibling comparison models or after the exclusion of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A dose–response relationship between the number of adverse perinatal events and increased risk for TD/CTD was also observed, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33–1.50) for one event to 2.42 (95% CI: 1.65–3.53) for five or more events. These results pave the way for future gene by environment interaction and epigenetic studies in TD/CTD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Few studies have examined the mode of birth among women with fear of childbirth, and the results are conflicting. The objective of this study was to assess the association between fear of childbirth and cesarean delivery in North European women. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted among 6,422 pregnant women from Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Estonia, Norway, and Sweden. Fear of childbirth was measured by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire during pregnancy and linked to obstetric information from hospital records. Results: Among 3,189 primiparous women, those reporting severe fear of childbirth were more likely to give birth by elective cesarean, (OR, 1.66 [95% CI 1.05–2.61]). Among 3,233 multiparous women, severe fear of childbirth increased the risk of elective cesarean (OR 1.87 [95% CI 1.30–2.69]). Reporting lack of positive anticipation, one of six dimensions of fear of childbirth, was most strongly associated with elective cesarean (OR 2.02 [95% CI 1.52–2.68]). A dose–effect pattern was observed between level of fear and risk of emergency cesarean in both primiparous and multiparous women. Indications for cesarean were more likely to be reported as 'nonmedical' among those with severe fear of childbirth; 16.7 versus 4.6 percent in primiparous women, and 31.7 versus 17.5 percent in multiparous women. Conclusion: Having severe fear of childbirth increases the risk of elective cesarean, especially among multiparous women. Lack of positive anticipation of the upcoming childbirth seems to be an important dimension of fear associated with cesarean delivery. Counseling for women who do not look forward to vaginal birth should be further evaluated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The Institute of Medicine (IOM) provides recommendations for optimal weight gain during pregnancy to minimize complications associated with obesity and excessive weight gain. The Health Belief Model and prior research suggest knowledge of health recommendations and associated risks motivate health behaviors. This study determined whether knowledge of maternal and infant obesity risks during pregnancy (ORDP) and knowledge of IOM gestational weight gain (GWG) recommendations were associated with total GWG and likelihood of adhering to IOM recommendations. Materials and Methods: In this prospective survey study, healthy women with a singleton pregnancy were recruited from prenatal clinic waiting rooms of a university medical center to complete a one-time survey of prepregnancy weight and height, demographic variables, knowledge of infant-related ORDP (e.g., large for gestational age), knowledge of maternal-related ORDP (e.g., Cesarean delivery), and knowledge of IOM GWG recommendations. Total GWG was obtained from clinic medical records. Logistic and multiple regression analyses were performed. Results: The sample consisted of 159 women with average age of 25 and prepregnancy body mass index of 28. Women in the sample were predominantly African American (57%) and from low socioeconomic conditions. Results showed (1) knowledge of GWG recommendations was inversely related to total GWG among normal and underweight women and (2) knowledge of infant-related ORDP was positively related to total GWG among overweight and obese women and the likelihood of exceeding recommendations among normal and underweight women. Knowledge of maternal-related ORDP was not related to GWG. Conclusion: As the Health Belief Model suggests, knowledge appears to be a modifiable factor in preventing excess GWG. However, there may be misinformation regarding how to adhere to clinical recommendations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: While there is a large body of work supporting the importance of early feeding practices on cognitive, immunity, behavioural and mental outcomes, few longitudinal studies have focused on motor development. The relationship between duration of breast feeding and motor development outcomes at 10, 14, and 17 years were examined. Methods: Data were obtained from the Western Australian Pregnancy (Raine) Study. There were 2868 live births recorded and children were examined for motor proficiency at 10 (M = 10.54, SD = 2.27), 14 (M = 14.02, SD = 2.33) and 17 (M = 16.99, SD = 2.97) years using the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND). Using linear mixed models, adjusted for covariates known to affect motor development, the influence of predominant breast feeding for &lt;6 months and ≥6 months on motor development outcomes was examined. Results: Breast feeding for ≥6 months was positively associated with improved motor development outcomes at 10, 14 and 17 years of age (p = 0.019, β 1.38) when adjusted for child’s sex, maternal age, alcohol intake, family income, hypertensive status, gestational stress and mode of delivery. Conclusion: Early life feeding practices have an influence on motor development outcomes into late childhood and adolescence independent of sociodemographic factors.

        <ab>Background: Childbirth is a potent trigger for the onset of psychiatric illness in women including postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum psychosis (PP). Medical complications occurring during pregnancy and/or childbirth have been linked to postpartum psychiatric illness and sociodemographic factors. We evaluated if pregnancy and obstetrical predictors have similar effects on different types of postpartum psychiatric disorders. Method: A population-based cohort study using Danish registers was conducted in 392 458 primiparous women with a singleton delivery between 1995 and 2012 and no previous psychiatric history. The main outcome was first-onset postpartum psychiatric episodes. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for any psychiatric contact in four quarters for the first year postpartum. Results: PPD and postpartum acute stress reactions were associated with pregnancy and obstetrical complications. For PPD, hyperemesis gravidarum [IRR 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93–3.73], gestational hypertension (IRR 1.84, 95% CI 1.33–2.55), pre-eclampsia (IRR 1.45, 95% CI 1.14–1.84) and Cesarean section (C-section) (IRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.13–1.53) were associated with increased risk. For postpartum acute stress, hyperemesis gravidarum (IRR 1.93, 95% CI 1.38–2.71), preterm birth (IRR 1.51, 95% CI 1.30–1.75), gestational diabetes (IRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03–1.97) and C-section (IRR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20–1.55) were associated with increased risk. In contrast, risk of PP was not associated with pregnancy or obstetrical complications. Conclusions: Pregnancy and obstetrical complications can increase the risk for PPD and acute stress reactions but not PP. Identification of postpartum women requiring secondary care is needed to develop targeted approaches for screening and treatment. Future work should focus on understanding the contributions of psychological stressors and underlying biology on the development of postpartum psychiatric illness.

        <ab>Objectives: To assess the association between elective caesarean section and postnatal depression compared with planned vaginal delivery and whether emergency caesarean section or assisted vaginal delivery is associated with postnatal depression compared with spontaneous vaginal delivery. Design Prospective population based cohort study. Setting ALSPAC (the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children). Participants: 14,663 women recruited antenatally with a due date between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992. Main outcome measure: Edinburgh postnatal depression scale score ≥ 13 at eight weeks postnatal on self completed questionnaire. Results: Albeit with wide confidence intervals, there was no evidence that elective caesarean section altered the odds of postnatal depression compared with planned vaginal delivery (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.70, P = 0.80). Among planned vaginal deliveries there was similarly little evidence of a difference between women who have emergency caesarean section or assisted vaginal delivery and those who have spontaneous vaginal delivery (1.17, 0.77 to 1.79, P = 0.46, and 0.89, 0.68 to 1.18, P = 0.42, respectively). Conclusions: There is no reason for women at risk of postnatal depression to be managed differently with regard to mode of delivery. Elective caesarean section does not protect against postnatal depression.Women who plan vaginal delivery and require emergency caesarean section or assisted vaginal delivery can be reassured that there is no reason to believe that they are at increased risk of postnatal depression.

        <ab>Aims: A special child welfare clinic (SCWC) in Norway provides care for pregnant women with substance abuse problems to prevent the adverse effects of substances. The SCWC aims to give treatment without replacements. This article describes neonatal findings among children of substance-abusing women at the clinic. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study including 62 children whose mothers had attended the SCWC during pregnancy. A comparison group with children of women with no substance abuse was included. Data were collected from medical records and by means of a questionnaire concerning neonatal data, health, and living conditions. SCWC mothers were divided into short-term users (substance use stopped within first trimester) and long-term users (continued moderate substance use throughout pregnancy). Results: Average birthweight and head circumference were significantly lower in the substance-abusing groups: 3,084 g and 34.0cm in the short-term group, 3,048 g and 33.9cm in the long-term group, and 3,496 g and 34.8cm in the comparison group. There was no difference in Apgar score. Substance abuse and psychiatric illness were associated with low birthweight. Long-term users were more likely than comparisons to experience premature birth and have lowbirthweight children. This difference was not found among short-term users. We found no difference in Caesarean sections and vacuum extractions. Conclusions: Substance abusers who stop their drug use early in pregnancy tend to have birth outcomes that are similar to those of mothers with no substance abuse. The study indicates that attendance at a voluntary, low-threshold initiative for pregnant substance abusers, with a focus on prenatal care and substance abuse treatment without replacements, may reduce the harmful effect of the abuse on the newborn.

        <ab>Purpose: The influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan and Lebanon over the last 5 years presents an immense burden to national health systems. This study was undertaken to assess utilization of maternal health services among Syrian refugees in both countries. Description: A cross-sectional survey of Syrian refugees living in urban and rural (non-camp) settings was conducted using a two-stage cluster survey design with probability proportional to size sampling in 2014–2015. Eighty-six percent of surveyed households in Lebanon and 88% of surveyed households in Jordan included women with a live birth in the last year. Information from women in this sub-set of households was analyzed to understand antenatal and intrapartum health service utilization. Assessment: A majority of respondents reported seeking antenatal care, 82% and 89% in Jordan and Lebanon, respectively. Women had an average of at least six antenatal care visits. Nearly all births (98% in Jordan and 94% in Lebanon) took place in a health facility. Cesarean rates were similar in both countries; approximately one-third of all births were cesarean deliveries. A substantial proportion of women incurred costs for intrapartum care; 33% of Syrian women in Jordan and 94% of Syrian women in Lebanon reported paying out of pocket for their deliveries. The proportion of women incurring costs for intrapartum care was higher in Jordan both countries for women with cesarean deliveries compared to those with vaginal deliveries; however, this difference was not statistically significant in either country (Jordan p-value = 0.203; Lebanon p-value = 0.099). Conclusion: Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon had similar levels of utilization of maternal health services, despite different health systems and humanitarian assistance provisions. As expected, a substantial proportion of households incurred out-of-pocket costs for essential maternal and newborn health services, making cost a major factor in care-seeking decisions and locations. As health financing policies shift to account for the continued burden of refugee hosting on the health system, sustained attention to the availability and quality of essential maternal and newborn health services is needed to protect both refugee and host populations women’s rights to health and health care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.

        <ab>Background: Protocols for neonatal care and mother–baby interaction at cesarean birth frequently differ from those at vaginal birth. There is increasing interest in adopting family-friendly or gentle protocols for women having cesarean birth. Current evidence suggests challenges in achieving interdepartmental cooperation and consensus are potential barriers to implementing gentle cesarean protocols. Purpose: To describe how care providers’ professional role and characteristics may affect perception about gentle cesarean birth techniques and inform specific concerns about protocol changes. Study Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey with mixed-methods analysis incorporating quantitative and qualitative conventional content analysis was used. A structured survey was distributed via email to all care providers on the labor and birth unit, including attending physicians, resident physicians in training, fellows, labor nurses, respiratory therapists, and operating room technicians. Quantitative responses were analyzed with bivariable tests and logistic regression to describe associations between provider attitudes and provider characteristics. Open-ended responses were analyzed with conventional content analysis to develop a model describing influences on overall provider attitudes. Results: Physicians and nurses generally have positive attitudes on benefits of gentle cesarean techniques. Their perceptions overall are informed by the balance of concerns about patient safety and logistical challenges versus perceived benefits of the techniques. On an individual level, care provider demographic and professional characteristics of gender and prior experience affected attitudes more than their specific role in patient care. Clinical Implications: Most labor and birth care providers have positive attitudes about gentle cesarean birth. Implementation of such programs should prioritize patient safety, educate physician and nurses about potential benefits for patients, and use experienced physicians and nurses as ambassadors to increase acceptance.

        <ab>Objectives: The breastfeeding initiation rate is extremely disparate worldwide and remains low in France, with a breastfeeding initiation rate of 60.2%. Some studies have reported increased early parenting difficulties in women who conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF). Our study had two main objectives: (1) to determine by a retrospective chart review the demographic and medical factors associated with breastfeeding versus formula feeding in women who had undergone IVF and (2) to assess by survey study the reasons for the infant feeding decision (breastfeeding versus formula feeding) for women who conceived by IVF. Subjects and Methods: By telephone interviews, we conducted a longitudinal nonexperimental cohort study of French women who had a live birth after IVF. Fertility data and obstetric outcomes were collected from individual medical records. Results: Among women who had a live birth after IVF (n = 13), 63% (n = 46) initiated breastfeeding for a mean duration of 6.2 ± 6.2 months. In our IVF population, the breastfeeding initiation rate was similar to that in the general French population. The following three factors were found to have a significant negative influence on breastfeeding initiation: duration of infertility greater than 2 years, cesarean delivery, and history of formula feeding when the women themselves were newborns. Conclusions: Long duration of infertility and history of cesarean delivery after IVF negatively influenced the breastfeeding initiation rate. For this subgroup of patients, postpartum care should be enhanced to support the early mother-baby relationship and promote breastfeeding.

        <ab>This is a retrospective comparison of pregnant women with perinatally acquired HIV-infection (PAH) with a cohort of pregnant women with behaviorally acquired HIV-infection (BAH). PAH cases (11 women) included all pregnant adolescents followed at our HIV clinic from January 2000 to January 2009. BAH cases (27 women) were randomly selected from all deliveries within the study period at the same institution. Demographics, mode of delivery, CD4+ counts, and viral loads (VLs) before, during, and six months postpartum, as well as neonatal outcomes, were reviewed. CD4 counts were significantly lower in the PAH group. VLs were statistically higher in the PAH group. VLs were undetectable at delivery in 60% of the PAH group compared with 88% of the BAH group. No cases of vertical transmission occurred. PAH women may be at a higher risk for HIV-related disease progression. This may increase vertical transmission risks. Further studies and interventions with this growing population are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression is a common and disabling complication of postpartum women. There is a paucity of research on postpartum depressive disorders and their predictors in women from Arab countries. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and identify risk factors of postpartum depression among Arab women in Qatar using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Score (EPDS). Design: This is a prospective cross-sectional study conducted during the period from January 2010 to May 2011. Setting: Primary healthcare centers of the Supreme Council of Health, State of Qatar. Subjects: A representative sample of 1669 mothers within 6 months after delivery were approached and 1379 (82.6%) mothers participated in this study. Methods: The study was based on a face-to-face interview with a designed diagnostic screening questionnaire. Occurrence of postpartum depressive symptoms was assessed by the EPDS. Also, socio-demographic characteristics, medical and family history, and obstetric variables of patients were collected through a designed questionnaire. The diagnostic screening questionnaire was reviewed and calculated the final score which identified the risk cases. Results: The prevalence of postpartum depression among the study sample was 17.6%. Mothers of age above 35 years (49.9% vs. 39.2%; p &lt; 0.001), low education below intermediate level (51% vs. 35.8%; p &lt; 0.001), housewives (38.7% vs. 29%; p = 0.03), with low monthly income (QR 5000-9999) (43.2% vs. 32.2%; p &lt; 0.001) were significantly at high risk for postpartum depression. Maternal complications (38.7% vs. 26.1%; p &lt; 0.001) and caesarean section (36.2% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.022) were significantly higher among depressed mothers compared to non-depressed women. Financial difficulties (OR = 2.04; p &lt; 0.001), prematurity (OR = 1.64; p = 0.025), poor family support (OR = 1.52; p = 0.016), dissatisfaction in marital life (OR = 1.26; p = 0.005), poor marital relationship (OR = 1.13; p = 0.05) were the main predictors of postpartum depression. Conclusion: This prevalence of postpartum depression in women living in Qatar was comparable to previous epidemiological research done in developing countries. Financial difficulties, prematurity, lack of family support, and poor marital relationships have been identified as main risk factors for developing postpartum depression.

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to investigate infant oral mutans streptococci (MS) by feeding method and by the mother’s oral MS status. For this cross-sectional data collection, full-term infants at 4–6 weeks of age and their mothers were tested for oral MS using the Dentocult® SM chairside test (Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland). For the 104 mother–infant pairs (68 breastfed, 36 formula-fed), the two groups differed by mother’s race/ethnicity (p = 0.006) but not by delivery mode, level of care at birth, or MS in the mothers or the infants. Thirty-one percent of mothers and 12% of infants were MS positive. Infant MS was not predicted by mother’s race/ethnicity, delivery mode, feeding method, or MS status. When stratified by feeding method, the mother’s MS status did significantly predict the infant’s MS status in the breastfed group (odds ratio = 5.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–33.7; p = 0.043). In conclusion, oral MS at &gt;10⁴ colony-forming units/mL were detected in 12% of the 4–6-week-old infants, and the effect of the mothers’ oral MS status was modified by the feeding method. Future research is needed to clarify the modifiable perinatal and maternal risks associated with the development of the infant’s predentate oral microbial environment, before the introduction of the first tooth.

        <ab>Background: In Central and Eastern Europe, many women make informal cash payments to ensure continuity of provider, i.e., to have a 'chosen' doctor who provided their prenatal care, be present for birth. High rates of obstetric interventions and disrespectful maternity care are also common to the region. No previous study has examined the associations among informal payments, intervention rates, and quality of maternity care. Methods: We distributed an online cross-sectional survey in 2014 to a nationally representative sample of Hungarian internet-using women (N = 600) who had given birth in the last 5 years. The survey included items related to socio-demographics, type of provider, obstetric interventions, and experiences of care. Women reported if they paid informally, and how much. We built a two-part model, where a bivariate probit model was used to estimate conditional probabilities of women paying informally, and a GLM model to explore the amount of payments. We calculated marginal effects of the covariates (provider choice, interventions, respectful care). Results: Many more women (79%) with a chosen doctor paid informally (191 euros on average) compared to 17% of women without a chosen doctor (86 euros). Based on regression analysis, the chosen doctor's presence at birth was the principal determinant of payment. Intervention and procedure rates were significantly higher for women with a chosen doctor versus without (cesareans 45% vs. 33%; inductions 32% vs. 19%; episiotomy 75% vs. 62%; epidural 13% vs. 5%), but had no direct effect on payments. Half of the sample (42% with a chosen doctor, 62% without) reported some form of disrespectful care, but this did not reduce payments. Conclusion: Despite reporting disrespect and higher rates of interventions, women rewarded the presence of a chosen doctor with informal payments. They may be unaware of evidence-based standards, and trust that their chosen doctor provided high quality maternity care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: The purpose of this study was to (1) describe and compare two obstetric Mayan populations in Guatemala, the Tz’utujil and the Kachiquel and (2) evaluate possible associations of demographics, wood fuel use, and obesity with pregnancy/ newborn outcomes. Design: This cross-sectional study interviewed participants at the time of routine obstetric ultrasounds at three institutions in Santiago Atitlán and one institution in San Lucas Tolimán. Data were collected from January 2010 to May 2013. Data entry and statistical analysis were performed using EPI InfoTM 7.1.2.0 (CDC). Results: The two populations were similar in maternal age, BMI, ownership of a phone, gravidity (number of times a women has been pregnant), history of spontaneous abortions, history of term pregnancies, newborn birth weights, cesarean section rate, and percentage of low-birth-weight newborns (LBW &lt; 2500 g). Obesity was present in 22% of the combined surveyed populations. Lowbirth- weight newborns and newborn macrosomia (newborn birth weight greater than 4000 g) were present in 5.5% and 3.7%, respectively. The newborn gender ratio (male to female) was equal to 0.92. The two populations differed in ownership of gas stoves and percentage of newborn macrosomia. Significant associations included: (1) female newborn gender and low birth weight, (2) obesity and newborn macrosomia, and (3) obesity and male gender. Conclusion: The two Mayan populations were similar in many of the obstetric variables. The percentage of low-birth-weight infants (5.5%) is considerably lower than reported prevalence data for Guatemala. The obstetric characteristics, differences, and similarities between these two Mayan populations should help in policy planning for obstetric care for these two populations and possibly other indigenous populations in Guatemala.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the relationships among sociodemographic and obstetric factors and symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) in Hispanic women living in rural California. Design: Quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive design. Setting: Rural southern California communities. Participants: A convenience sample of 223 Hispanic women, ages 18 to 42 years old, with one living infant younger than 12 months old. Methods: Interviewer-administered Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and sociodemographic and obstetric history survey (maternal age, marital status, education, annual household income, employment, sex of infant, birth type, and number of children). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to determine associations and predictive relationships among sociodemographic and obstetric factors and symptoms of PPD. Results: Low education levels, unemployment, cesarean birth, and more than one young child were significantly related to PPD risk (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores ≥ 10). Many of the factors associated with PPD symptoms in this sample of Hispanic women were similar to those previously reported in the literature. Conclusion: Our findings highlighted the need for PPD care among Hispanic women in rural areas. Early assessment and intervention for symptoms of PPD are needed to enhance health equity and promote better health for women who live in rural communities.

        <ab>The goal of this study was to determine whether an association between histories of depression and adverse pregnancy outcome could be established using a retrospective analysis. Participants were a convenience sample of 152 pregnant diabetic women for whom prior pregnancy data were available. Prior pregnancy outcome, depression history, and other clinical characteristics were determined from chart review and medical history questionnaires. Logistic regression was used to determine which of the measured clinical factors had a significant association with history of pregnancy complications. Thirty-nine patients (26%) had a past history of depression. Three pregnancy complications (preterm labor, pre-eclampsia, fetal prematurity) were more common in the group having a history of depression as was the proportion of participants requiring Caesarean section. A history of depression was associated with prior pregnancy complications independent of the effects of parity, prepregnancy BMI, tobacco use history, diabetes type, and presence of diabetes complications. These retrospective data indicate that depression is linked to complications of diabetic pregnancy and support the need for prospective studies to clarify the effects of depression and its treatment on diabetic pregnancy.

        <ab>Background: Few studies have systematically addressed the role of epidural analgesia and caesarean delivery in predicting the post-partum disease activity in women with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The objective of this study was to assess the impact of epidural analgesia (EA) and caesarean delivery (CD) on the risk of post-partum relapses and disability in women with MS. Methods: In the context of an Italian prospective study on the safety of immunomodulators in pregnancy, we included pregnancies occurred between 2002 and 2008 in women with MS regularly followed-up in 21 Italian MS centers. Data were gathered through a standardized, semi-structured interview, dealing with pregnancy outcomes, breastfeeding, type of delivery (vaginal or caesarean) and EA. The risk of post-partum relapses and disability progression (1 point on the Expanded Disability Status Sclae, EDSS, point, confirmed after six months) was assessed through a logistic multivariate regression analysis. Results: We collected data on 423 pregnancies in 415 women. Among these, 349 pregnancies resulted in full term deliveries, with a post-partum follow-up of at least one year (mean follow-up period 5.5 ± 3.1 years). One hundred and fifty-five patients (44.4%) underwent CD and 65 (18.5%) EA. In the multivariate analysis neither CD, nor EA were associated with a higher risk of post-partum relapses. Post-partum relapses were related to a higher EDSS score at conception (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.11-1.82; p = 0.005), a higher number of relapses in the year before pregnancy (OR = 1.62; 95% CI 1.15-2.29; p = 0.006) and during pregnancy (OR = 3.07; 95% CI 1.40-6.72; p = 0.005). Likewise, CD and EA were not associated with disability progression on the EDSS after delivery. The only significant predictor of disability progression was the occurrence of relapses in the year after delivery (disability progression in the year after delivery: OR = 4.00; 95% CI 2.0-8.2; p &lt; 0.001; disability progression over the whole follow-up period: OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.3; p = 0.005). Conclusions: Our findings, show no correlation between EA, CD and postpartum relapses and disability. Therefore these procedures can safely be applied in MS patients. On the other hand, post-partum relapses are significantly associated with increased disability, which calls for the need of preventive therapies after delivery.

        <ab>The study aimed to examine the course of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) across pregnancy and its impact on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Women enrolled prior to 20-week gestation in a prospective, observational study. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was completed to obtain lifetime Axis I diagnoses. A total of 56 women with OCD were followed at 1 to 3-month intervals through 52 weeks postpartum. Each visit, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), clinical assessment, and medication/exposure tracking were performed. Obstetric and neonatal data were abstracted from the medical record. In subjects with OCD, associations between perinatal obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCSs) and outcomes were examined. Additionally, outcomes were compared to 156 matched psychiatric patients without OCD. Maternal age inversely correlated with the YBOCS scores across the study period (β = −0.5161, p = .0378). Cesarean section was associated with increased OCSs in the postpartum period compared to vaginal delivery (β = 5.3632, p = 0.043). No associations were found between severity of perinatal obsessions or compulsions and any specific obstetric or neonatal complications. Subjects without OCD had higher frequency of fetal loss compared to mothers with OCD (χ² = 4.03, p = 0.043). These novel prospective data fail to identify an association of OCSs with adverse outcomes. In contrast, there is an association of delivery method and younger maternal age with increased postnatal symptoms of OCD. Psychiatric subjects without OCD may have a higher risk of miscarriage and intrauterine fetal demise compared to subjects with OCD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aims: This retrospective, population based study was designed to investigate risk factors for development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and their possible interrelationships, in neonates of gestational age (GA) &lt;32 weeks born in a well-defined geographical region. Study design—subjects: The study population included all preterm infants born alive with GA 24–32 weeks in Northwestern Greece during a 9-year period and hospitalised in the regional neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Outcome measurements: The association was assessed of the presence of ROP with maternal factors: age, pathology of pregnancy, in-vitro fertilisation, multiple gestation, mode of delivery, perinatal factors: gender, antenatal steroids, transportation, resuscitation, GA, birth weight (BW), small for GA status and postnatal morbidity: chronic lung disease (CLD), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), maximum O₂ needs, hypoxic/hyperoxic episodes, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), sepsis, using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 189 infants without congenital anomalies born at GA 24–32 weeks ROP was diagnosed in 24 (12.7%) (&gt;grade 2: 6). Logistic regression analysis showed ROP to be strongly associated with GA, odds ratio (OR) 2.1, confidence interval (CI) 1.3–3.3, p &lt; 0.01 and CLD, OR 10.2, CI 2.3–44, p &lt; 0.01, respectively, independent of confounding factors. By estimating interaction on an additive scale it was shown that the combined risk effect of GA and CLD was larger than the sum of the individual risk effects, implying synergistic effect. Conclusions: ROP was closely and independently related to both low GA and the diagnosis of CLD, which were interrelated in the development of ROP.

        <ab>Objective: Using national register data, the authors examined the relationship between prenatal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment and pregnancy complications, accounting for psychiatric diagnoses related to SSRI use. Method: This was a population-based prospective birth cohort study using national register data. The sampling frame included 845,345 offspring, representing all singleton live births in Finland between 1996 and 2010. Pregnancies were classified as exposed to SSRIs (N=15,729), unexposed to SSRIs but with psychiatric diagnoses (N=9,652), and unexposed to medications and psychiatric diagnoses (N=31,394). Pregnancy outcomes in SSRI users were compared with those in the unexposed groups. Results: Offspring of mothers who received SSRI prescriptions during pregnancy had a lower risk for late preterm birth (odds ratio=0.84, 95% CI=0.74–0.96), for very preterm birth (odds ratio=0.52, 95% CI=0.37–0.74), and for cesarean section (odds ratio=0.70, 95% CI=0.6620.75) compared with offspring of mothers unexposed to medications but with psychiatric disorders. In contrast, in SSRI-treated mothers, the risk was higher for offspring neonatal complications, including low Apgar score (odds ratio=1.68, 95% CI=1.34–2.12) and monitoring in a neonatal care unit (odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI=1.14–1.35). Compared with offspring of unexposed mothers, offspring of SSRI-treated mothers and mothers unexposed to medications but with psychiatric disorders were both at increased risk of many adverse pregnancy outcomes, including cesarean section and need for monitoring in a neonatal care unit. Conclusions: In a large national birth cohort, treatment of maternal psychiatric disorders with SSRIs during pregnancy was related to a lower risk of preterm birth and cesarean section but a higher risk of neonatal maladaptation. The findings provide novel evidence for a protective role of SSRIs on some deleterious reproductive outcomes, possibly by reducing maternal depressive symptoms. The divergent findings suggest that clinical decisions on SSRI use during pregnancy should be individualized, taking into account the mother’s psychiatric and reproductive history.

        <ab>Objective: Postpartum depression is related to many adverse effects in both mothers and their children; therefore, proper screening and early interventions are needed. This study aims to identify the risk factors of postpartum depression. Our primary focus is on obstetric risk factors. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study which we extracted the data of women who gave birth between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2012 from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment service (HIRA) database. We analyzed the data using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: A total of 17,483 (1.4%) women suffered from depression during the postpartum period. Younger (&lt; 20years) and advanced maternal age (≥ 35years), primiparity, previous depression, peripartum hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, preterm delivery, placental abruption, cesarean delivery, induced labor, and preeclampsia were found to increase the likelihood of having depression after delivery. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are several risk factors that lead women to postpartum depression. Therefore, early detection and well-management of the symptoms and risk factors for postpartum depression along with social support can help both physical and psychological conditions of women after childbirth.

        <ab>Introduction: Many birth units use central fetal monitoring (CFM) under the assumption that greater surveillance improves perinatal outcomes. The unexpected loss of the CFM system at a tertiary unit provided a unique opportunity to evaluate outcomes and staff attitudes toward CFM. Methods: This retrospective cohort study compared patient data from 2,855 electronically monitored women delivering over a 12-month period, where CFM was available for the first 6 months but unavailable for the following 6 months. Primary outcomes relating to neonatal morbidity and secondary outcomes relating to intrapartum interventions were examined. Additionally, birth unit staff members were surveyed about aspects of care related to CFM. Results: There were no significant differences in perinatal outcomes between the cohorts. While unadjusted analysis suggested a lower spontaneous vaginal birth rate (55.4% vs 60.3%) and a higher cesarean delivery rate (25.1% vs 22.0%, p = 0.026), together with higher epidural (53.0% vs 49.2%, p = 0.04) and fetal blood sampling (11.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.03) rates in the presence of CFM, these differences were lost when adjusted for prostaglandin ripening. Over half of the staff (56.0% of midwives, 54.0% of obstetricians) reported spending more time with the laboring woman in the period without CFM. Conclusions: This single institution’s experience indicates that in birth units staffed for one-to-one care in labor, central fetal monitoring does not appear to be associated with either a benefit on perinatal outcomes or an increase in cesarean delivery and other interventions. However, it is associated with a reduction in the time a midwife spends with the laboring woman. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Obesity is a complex disease that involves both environmental and genetic factors in its pathogenesis. Several studies have identified multiple obesity-associated loci in many populations. However, their contribution to obesity in the Vietnamese population is not fully described, especially in children. The study aimed to investigate the association of obesity with Val66Met polymorphism in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, delivery method, birth weight, and lifestyle factors in Vietnamese primary school children. Methods: A case–control study was conducted on 559 children aged 6–11 years (278 obese cases and 281 normal controls). The obesity of the children was classified using both criteria of International Obesity Task Force (IOTF, 2000) and World Health Organization (WHO, 2007). Lifestyle factors, birth delivery, and birth weight of the children were self-reported by parents. The BDNF genotype was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Association was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression and cross-validated by the Bayesian model averaging method. Results: The most significantly independent factors for obesity were delivery method (cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery, β = 0.56, p = 0.007), birth weight (&gt; 3500 to &lt; 4000 g vs. 2500–3500 g, β = 0.52, p = 0.035; ≥ 4000 g vs. 2500–3500 g, β = 1.06, p = 0.015), night sleep duration (&lt; 8 h/day vs. ≥ 8 h/day, β = 0.99, p &lt; 0.0001), and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (AA and GG vs. AG, β = 0.38, p = 0.039). Conclusions: The study suggested the significant association of delivery method, birth weight, night sleep duration, and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, with obesity in Vietnamese primary school children.

        <ab>Importance: Between 0.3% and 0.5% of all pregnancies occur among women with epilepsy. Evidence suggests an increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality among women with epilepsy. However, these risks have not been quantified in large population-based samples. Objective: To report on the risk for death and adverse outcomes at the time of delivery for women with epilepsy in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of pregnant women identified through delivery hospitalization records from the 2007-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. From this representative sample of 20% of all US hospitals, we obtained a weighted sample of delivery hospitalizations from 69 385 women with epilepsy and 20 449 532 women without epilepsy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Obstetrical outcomes including maternal death, cesarean delivery, length of stay, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and stillbirth. Results: Women with epilepsy had a risk of death during delivery hospitalization of 80 deaths per 100 000 pregnancies, significantly higher than the 6 deaths per 100 000 pregnancies found among women without epilepsy (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 11.46 [95% CI, 8.64-15.19]). Women with epilepsy were also at a heightened risk for other adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia (adjusted OR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.54-1.63]), preterm labor (adjusted OR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.50-1.57]), and stillbirth (adjusted OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.17-1.38]), and had increased health care utilization, including an increased risk of cesarean delivery (adjusted OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.38-1.42]) and prolonged length of hospital stay (&gt;6 days) among both women with cesarean deliveries (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 2.03-2.23]) and women with vaginal deliveries (adjusted OR, 2.60 [95% CI, 2.41-2.80]). Conclusions and Relevance: Findings suggest that women with epilepsy are at considerably heightened risk for many adverse outcomes during their delivery hospitalization, including a more than 10-fold increased risk of death, and that increased clinical attention is imperative for these pregnancies.

        <ab>Aims: The aims of this project were twofold: to compare our current venous thromboembolism management in postoperative Caesarean section patients with the current best evidence on the use of graduated compression stockings and to standardise mechanical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines where multiple approaches had previously been used. Method: Thirty post-Caesarean section patients from a private hospital in Perth, Western Australia, were audited in a three-phase project: (i) the initial audit; (ii) clinical practice change including greater venous thromboembolism awareness and targeted education for midwives, standardised guidelines for mechanical prophylaxis, the development of an online venous thromboembolism module, a venous thromboembolism prophylaxis policy and heightened consumer involvement; and (iii) a follow-up audit. Results: Our initial audit result demonstrated opportunities for improvement across all audit criteria. The interventions were undertaken over a 3-month period from August to October 2010. The follow-up audit results showed pleasing improvements across four audit criteria with one criterion unchanged. Conclusion: While the follow-up audit showed significant clinical improvements, the tight time frame for the development and implementation of multiple interventions created major challenges. We believe that given time to embed these changes, further improvements will be seen. Ongoing audits will be conducted to ensure the sustainability of these changes. The change in practice and subsequent improvements demonstrated at this private hospital provide evidence to encourage other midwifery units to pursue best practice in the management of this high-risk patient cohort.

        <ab>Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in health outcomes are dynamic and vary over time. Differences between countries-can provide useful insights into the causes of health inequalities. The study aims to compare the associations between two measures of socioeconomic position (SEP)—maternal education and family income—and maternal and infant health outcomes between ALSPAC and Pelotas cohorts. Methods: Birth cohort studies were started in Avon, UK, in 1991 (ALSPAC) and in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, in 1982, 1993 and 2004. Maternal outcomes included smoking during pregnancy, caesarean section and delivery not attended by a doctor. Infant outcomes were preterm birth, intra-uterine growth restriction (lUGB) and breast feeding for &lt;3 months. The relative index of inequality was used for each measure of SEP so that results were comparable between cohorts. Results: An inverse association (higher prevalence among the poorest and less educated) was observed for almost all outcomes, with the exception of caesarean sections where a positive association was found. Stronger income-related inequalities for smoking and education-related inequalities for breast feeding were found in the ALSPAC study. However, greater inequalities in caesarean section and education-related inequalities in preterm birth were observed in the Pelotas cohorts. Conclusions: Mothers and infants have more adverse health outcomes if they are from poorer and less well-educated socioeconomic backgrounds in both Brazil and the UK. However, our findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between SEP and health outcomes. Examining differential socioeconomic patterning of maternal and infant health outcomes might help understanding of mechanisms underlying such inequalities.

        <ab>Background: Although increases in perinatal mortality risk associated with fetal macrosomia are well documented, the optimal route of delivery for fetuses with suspected macrosomia remains controversial. The objective of this investigation was to assess the risk of neonatal death among macrosomic infants delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean section. Methods: Data were derived from the U.S. 1995-1999 Linked Live Birth-Infant Death Cohort files and term (37-44 wk), single live births to United States resident mothers selected. A proportional hazards model was used to analyze the risk of neonatal death associated with cesarean delivery among 3 categories of macrosomic infants (infants weighing 4,000-4,499 g; 4,500-4,999 g; and 5,000+ g). Results: After controlling for maternal characteristics and complications, the adjusted hazard ratio for neonatal death associated with cesarean delivery among the 3 categories of macrosomic infants was 1.40, 1.30, and 0.85. Conclusions: Although cesarean delivery may reduce the risk of death for the heaviest infants (5,000+ g), the relative benefit of this intervention for macrosomic infants weighing 4,000-4,999 g remains debatable. Thus, policies in support of prophylactic cesarean delivery for suspected fetal macrosomia may need to be reevaluated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Perinatal common mental disorders are a major cause of disability among women and have consequences for children's growth and development. We aimed to identify factors associated with psychological distress, a proxy for common mental disorders, among mothers in rural Dhanusha, Nepal. Methods: We used data from 9078 mothers who were screened for distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) around six weeks after delivery. We assessed the association between GHQ-12 score and socioeconomic, gender-based, cultural and reproductive health factors using a hierarchical analytical framework and multilevel linear regression models. Results: Using a threshold GHQ-12 score of ≥ 6 to indicate caseness, the prevalence of distress was 9.8% (886/9078). Factors that predicted distress were severe food insecurity (β 2.21 (95% confidence interval 1.43, 3.40)), having a multiple birth (2.28 (1.27, 4.10)), caesarean section (1.70 (0.29, 2.24)), perinatal health problems (1.58 (1.23, 2.02)), no schooling (1.37 (1.08, 1.73)), fewer assets (1.33 (1.10, 1.60)), five or more children (1.33 (1.09, 1.61)), poor or no antenatal care (1.31 (1.15, 1.48) p &lt; 0.001), having never had a son (1.31 (1.14, 1.49)), not staying in the parental home in the postnatal period (1.15 (1.02, 1.30)), having a husband with no schooling (1.17 (0.96, 1.43)) and lower maternal age (0.99 (0.97, 1.00)). Limitations: The study was cross-sectional and we were therefore unable to infer causality. Because data were not collected for some established predictors, including infant death, domestic violence and history of mental illness, we could not assess their associations with distress. Conclusions: Socioeconomic disadvantage, gender inequality and poor reproductive health predict distress among mothers in Dhanusha. Maternal and child health programmes, as well as poverty alleviation and educational interventions, may be beneficial for maternal mental health.

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To investigate the prevalence of perineal morbidity at 12 months postnatal and its relationship to type of birth and birth risk factors. Background: It is well documented that women endure short-term postnatal perineal morbidity following childbirth (e.g. incontinence, perineal pain and sexual morbidity). However, to date, very little research has been carried out on the long-term effects of perineal morbidity and its relationship to the type of birth the women experienced and other birth risk factors (e.g. ethnic origin, age, parity, length of labour, epidural anaesthesia). Design: A retrospective, cross-sectional community survey of postnatal women within two maternity units in Birmingham. Methods: A total population sample of 2,100 women were surveyed using a self-administered postal questionnaire. The questionnaire included self-assessment of perineal pain, perineal healing, urinary incontinence, flatus incontinence, faecal incontinence, sexual morbidity and dyspareunia. Demographic details, type of birth and birth risk factors were taken from the hospital's computerized maternity information system. Results: Four hundred and eighty-two women responded to the questionnaire (23.3%). Overall, a high level of enduring perineal morbidity was reported with 87% complaining of at least one index of morbidity. Instrumental births were associated with higher levels of certain types of perineal morbidity than women following a caesarean section or normal vaginal birth (stress and urge urinary incontinence, flatus incontinence, sexual morbidity and dyspareunia). In particular, women following a forceps birth reported higher levels of morbidity than normal or ventouse birth (continual, stress and urge urinary incontinence and flatus incontinence), even when comparing with the same degree of perineal trauma. Increasing age, increasing birth weight, length of labour and particularly Asian ethnic origin were also identified as risk factors for certain types of perineal morbidity. Conclusions: The study concludes that enduring perineal morbidity in women following childbirth is common, especially with women following a forceps birth and certain birth risk factors (i.e. age, ethnic origin, length of labour and birth weight). Relevance to clinical practice: These findings highlight the need for further research and provide a number of challenges for health-care services and health-care professionals.

        <ab>Objectives: In light of the potential physical and emotional costs to both woman and child, this study was conducted to assess pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in primiparae at very advanced maternal age (VAMA, aged ≥ 45) compared to younger primiparae. Methods: Retrospective cohort study comparing 222 VAMA primiparae and a reference group of 222 primiparae aged 30–35, delivering at Sheba Medical Center from 2008 through 2013. Results: VAMA primiparae were more likely than younger primiparae to be single, to have chronic health conditions, and higher rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational-hypertension (GHTN) and preeclampsia-eclampsia. VAMA primiparae conceived mostly by oocyte donation. They were more likely to be hospitalized during pregnancy, to deliver preterm and by cesarean birth. Infants of VAMA primiparae were at greater risk for low birthweight and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission. There were no differences in outcomes between VAMA primiparae with or without preexisting chronic conditions, or between those aged 45–49 and ≥ 50. In multivariable analysis VAMA was an independent risk factor for GDM, GHTN and preeclamsia-eclampsia, with adjusted odds ratio of 2.38 (95 % CI 1.32, 4.29), 5.80 (95 % CI 2.66, 12.64) and 2.45 (95 % CI 1.03, 5.85); respectively. The effect of age disappeared in multiple pregnancies. Conclusions: Primiparity at VAMA holds a significant risk for adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The absence of chronic medical conditions or the use of a young oocyte donor does not improve these outcomes. Multiple pregnancies hold additional risk and may diminish the effect of age. Primiparity at an earlier age should be encouraged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Pregnant women with a military-deployed spouse have increased risk of depression and self-reported stress. In nonmilitary populations, depression and stress during pregnancy are associated with adverse birth outcomes. This study assesses the association between a spouse’s military deployment and adverse birth outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a large military medicine center in the Northwest and evaluated records of singleton deliveries to dependent Army spouses from September 2001 to September 2011. We used logistic regression to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the associations between deployment and low birth weight (&lt;2,500 g), preterm delivery (&lt;37 weeks), small for gestational age (SGA, &lt;10 percentile for gestational age), and cesarean delivery. We identified 10,536 births; 1,364 (12.9%) spouses were deployed at delivery. No associations were observed in the overall population. Among women with two or more children, we observed an 81% increased risk of SGA (95% CI 1.18–2.79). Women 30 to 34 years old had an 82% (95% CI 1.06–3.14) increased risk of low birth weight and an 84% increased risk of SGA (95% CI 1.13–2.98). Deployment’s effects vary by maternal age and the number of children in the household. These findings may inform programs and practitioners to best serve women with military-deployed spouses.

        <ab>Background: Decreased sensation of fetal movements (DFM) is a common maternal complaint. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the association between DFM and pregnancy outcome in singleton gestation at term according to parity. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies at term between 2008 and 2013. Eligibility was limited to women carrying a fetus with no known structural or chromosomal anomalies, at 37 + 0/7 to 42 + 0/7 weeks of gestation. Women presenting to the delivery ward with DFM were compared with women without similar complaints. Results: Overall, 12,564 nulliparous women and 25,292 multiparous women gave birth during the study period; of them, 300 nulliparous women (2.4%) and 525 multiparous women (2.1%) complained of DFM. For nulliparous women, after adjusting for potential confounders, DFM was associated with antepartum fetal death (aOR 4.6 [95% CI 1.1–19.8]), cesarean delivery (CD) (aOR 1.3 [95% CI 1.01–1.8]), 1‐minute Apgar score less than 7 (aOR 2.3 [95% CI 1.5–3.5]) and neonatal seizures (aOR 3.2 [95% CI 1.3–8.2]). For multiparous women, DFM was associated with unscheduled CD (aOR 2.7 [95% CI 1.6–4.6]) and CD indicated by intermediate/abnormal fetal heart rate tracing (aOR 4.8 [95% CI 2.8–8.4]). Conclusions: DFM carries different outcomes according to parity. Although for nulliparous women, DFM is associated with increased risk of CD and immediate adverse perinatal outcome, for multiparous women it is associated with increased risk for CD, with no immediate increased risk for adverse perinatal outcome.

        <ab>Background: The optimal effective dose of epidural morphine that provides postoperative analgesia after caesarean section with minimal side effects remains debated. Aims: We performed a systematic review to assess the analgesic efficacy and the incidence of adverse effects of epidural morphine after caesarean section compared to systemic analgesia with opioids. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane Collaboration Library databases. Studies were evaluated with the Modified Oxford Scale. Prospective randomized studies comparing analgesic efficacy and/or adverse effects of a single epidural morphine administration versus systemic opioids after elective caesarean section were included. Results: Ten studies (n = 431) were selected. Epidural morphine increases the time until the first request for a rescue analgesic (Emax, 29.7 h; 95% confidence interval, 25.2–33.9) and decreases pain scores and postoperative morphine request during the first 24 h compared to systemic opioid analgesia. However, epidural morphine increases the incidence of pruritus (relative risk, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.1–3.6) and nausea (relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.3). Conclusions: A single bolus of epidural morphine provides better analgesia than parenteral opioids but with an effect limited to the first postoperative day after caesarean section and with an increase in morphine side effects.

        <ab>Study Objectives: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is more prevalent in ex-preterm children compared to the general pediatric population. However, it is unknown whether OSAS in ex-preterm children is associated with specific perinatal risk factors. This multicenter cohort study aimed to determine perinatal factors associated with OSAS at school age. Methods: 197 ex-preterm (500–1,250 g) children aged 5–12 y who participated as neonates in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of caffeine versus placebo (Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity) underwent comprehensive ambulatory polysomnography. A negative binomial regression model was used to identify perinatal risk factors associated with OSAS. Results: 19 children had OSAS (9.6%). Chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation were positively associated with OSAS with P values of 0.014 and 0.03, respectively. Maternal white race (P = 0.047) and maternal age (P = 0.002) were negatively associated with OSAS. Other risk factors, such as birth weight, Apgar score at 5 min, antenatal corticosteroids, delivery route, and sex were not significant. Conclusions: OSAS is very frequent, and is associated with chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation in ex-preterm children. Those born to older white mothers appear to be protected. We speculate that the former may be due to systemic inflammation and the latter to a higher socio-economic status. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Emotional and behavioral problems at an early age can reasonably be considered a high‐risk factor for later mental health disorders. The aim of the article is to reveal predictive factors of 1½‐year‐old children's emotional and behavioral problems. The study was a part of a prospective birth‐cohort study. The study sample consisted of 172 full‐term infants (born during Gestational Weeks 37–42) and their mothers. Emotional and behavioral problems at the age of 1½ years were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1½‐5 (T. Achenbach &amp; L. Rescorla, 2000), which was completed by mothers. Emotional and behavioral problems at age of 1½ years were more prevalent in infants born via cesarean section, as compared to infants born vaginally without administration of medication. Newborns’ suboptimal functioning after birth, complicated emotional acceptance of pregnancy, a couple's nonsatisfactory relationship during pregnancy, maternal distress during pregnancy and in the first months after childbirth, and inflexible and parent‐oriented attitudes toward infant‐rearing also predicted children's emotional and behavioral problems independent of sociodemographic factors. Results suggest that biomedical and psychosocial factors which manifest themselves in the prenatal and perinatal periods can have associations with later infant and child mental health.

        <ab>Objective: To determine the associated factors for hypertensive disorders among obese pregnant women and also to determine the maternal and perinatal outcome in these patients. Design: This is a cross sectional and cohort study. Methodology: The study was done from July 2006 until July 2007 in 388 women who are pregnant with body mass index 30 kg/m², admitted for delivery. They were chosen based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and interviewed using questionnaires and the outcome of the pregnancy were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of hypertension among obese pregnant women in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia is 35%. Factors that contributed to hypertension among the study group were family history of hypertension, practice of healthy lifestyle, previous history of hypertension in the pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus. Results of associated factors for obese hypertension by multiple logistic regressions for healthy lifestyle, previous hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus showed significant association. Results also showed significant increased in the number of induction of labour (lOL) and premature delivery among obese hypertensive women where both have p value of 0.001. There were 21.24% of subjects who had lOL due to pre eclampsia and 30.09% due to diabetes mellitus on treatment. There was no significant difference in the mode of delivery among these two groups. However perinatal outcome showed significant number of low birth weight babies and significant number of admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the obese hypertensive women. There was also significant number of babies with low Apgar score in the obese hypertensive women. Conclusion: Family history of hypertension, the practice of healthy lifestyle, previous history of hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus were the associated factors that contribute to hypertensive disorders in obese pregnant women.

        <ab>Objective: to assess Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores and delay to resume sexual activity associated with a previous severe maternal morbidity. Method: This was a multidimensional retrospective cohort study. Women who gave birth at a Brazilian tertiary maternity between 2008 and 2012 were included, with data extraction from the hospital information system. Those with potentially life-threatening conditions and maternal near miss episodes (severe maternal morbidity) were considered the exposed group. The control group was a random sample of women who had had uncomplicated pregnancy. Female sexual function was evaluated through FSFI questionnaire, and general and reproductive aspects were addressed through specific questions. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney and Pearson´s Chi-square for bivariate analyses. Logistic regression was used to identify variables independently associated with lower FSFI scores. Results: 638 women were included (315 at exposed and 323 at not exposed groups). The majority of women were under 30 years-old in the control group and between 30 and 46 years-old in the exposed group (p = 0.003). Women who experienced severe maternal morbidity (SMM) had statistically significant differences regarding cesarean section (82.4% versus 47.1% among deliveries without complications, p &lt; 0.001), and some previous pathological conditions. FSFI mean scores were similar among groups ranging from 24.39 to 24.42. It took longer for exposed women to resume sexual activity after index pregnancy (mean 84 days after SMM and 65 days for control group, p = 0.01). Multiple analyses showed no significant association of FSFI below cut-off value with any predictor.Conclusion: FSFI scores were not different in both groups. However, they were lower than expected. SMM delayed resumption of sexual activity after delivery, beyond postpartum period. However, the proportion of women in both groups having sex at 3 months after delivery was similar. Altered sexual response may be evaluated as one of possible long-term consequences after SMM episodes. Further studies on the growing population of women surviving severe maternal conditions might be worth for improvement of care for women.

        <ab>Objectives: Sleep problems and deprivation are common during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies are mostly descriptive or focused on specific clinical groups and late pregnancy. We aimed to identify sleep duration trajectories during the pregnancy period, their associated factors, and impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods: We studied 200 women from a mother–child cohort recruited in 2009–2011 from the French general population. We used semi-parametric models to analyze data collected through questionnaires. Results: We detected three sleep duration trajectories during pregnancy: short-decreasing (&lt; 6.5 h/night, 10.8% of the sample), medium-decreasing (6.5-8h/night, 57.6%), and long-increasing (&gt; 8 h/night, 31.6%) trajectories. Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13 [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working &gt; 28 weeks of gestational age (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10–0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e. cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion: We identified sleep trajectories among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal and child health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>To revisit the head circumference (HC) of newborns in public and private maternity hospitals; to correlate our findings with the gestational age, gender, and type of delivery; and build and validate graphs and curves. Methods: This was a prospective study performed on healthy newborns. Differences in HC were analyzed as a function of gestational age, gender, the healthcare system and the type of delivery. Smoothed percentile curves were created using the least mean squares method. Results: Of the included newborns, 697 were born in private maternity hospitals and 2,150 were born in public maternity hospitals. In all, 839 were born by vaginal delivery, and 1,311 were born by cesarean delivery. At 37 to 42 weeks of gestation, male newborns had a larger HC than females. Infants born in private maternity and those born by cesarean delivery had a larger HC. Conclusion: An important result of the present study is that our analyses allowed us to generate curves and statistically-validated graphs that can be used in clinical neonatal practice (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>
        <ab>Objetivo: Revisitar o perímetro cefálico (PC) de recém nascidos (RN) correlacionando com a idade gestacional (IG), gênero, tipo de parto (TP), sistema de saúde e construir e validar gráficos e curvas. Métodos: Estudou-se prospectivamente RN sadios analisando-se as diferenças entre os PC segundo a IG, gênero, TP e sistema de saúde. As curvas suavizadas de percentis foram criadas pelo método LMS (least mean squares). Resultados: 692 nasceram em maternidades privadas, 2.150 em maternidade pública, 839 nasceram de parto vaginal e 1.311 parto cesáreo. O gênero masculino apresentou PC maior que o feminino nas IG de 37 a 42 semanas. Os RN de maternidades privadas tiveram PC maior que os de maternidade pública. Os nascidos de parto cesáreo tiveram PC maior que os de parto vaginal. Conclusão: Importante consequência deste estudo foi que os resultados permitiram a criação de curvas e gráficos validados estatisticamente de aplicabilidade na prática clínica neonatal.

        <ab>Objective: Limited evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants can hinder platelet aggregation and can increase the risk of hemorrhage. Because antenatal depression is common and is often treated with antidepressants, we sought to determine if exposure to SSRI antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage compared with non-SSRI antidepressants. Method: This was a population-based nested case-control study of women aged 16 to 45 years in Ontario, Canada, who received government-funded prescription coverage within 2 years before delivery. We identified case patients with postpartum hemorrhage and matched controls (1:10) without postpartum hemorrhage from the same cohort. Controls were matched to cases on age, mode of delivery, parity, and calendar time. We linked prescription claims data to hospital and physician records for the study period (January 1999 to March 2005). Exclusion criteria included drugs and medical conditions that predispose to hemorrhage, and receipt of multiple antidepressants in the 6 months preceding delivery. Antidepressant drug exposure was classified as SSRI or other agents within 90 days before delivery. Results: There were 2460 postpartum hemorrhage cases and 23,943 matched controls. The adjusted odds ratio for the association between postpartum hemorrhage and exposure to SSRIs within 90 days before index date was 1.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.72) as compared with 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-2.01) for non-SSRIs. Conclusions: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors confer no disproportionate risk of postpartum hemorrhage at the time of delivery compared with non-SSRI antidepressants. This information may help guide decisions regarding pharmacotherapy for depression during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine primary cesarean delivery rates among women with low risk pregnancies in urban and rural hospitals in Hawaii. Methods: This is a retrospective study of all low-risk women (term, vertex, singleton) who had a primary cesarean delivery in any Hawaii hospital from 2010 to 2011 using a statewide health information database. Hospitals were divided into two categories: rural and urban. Results: Of the 27,096 women who met criteria for this study, 7105 (26.2 %) delivered in a rural hospital. Low-risk women who delivered in a rural hospital had a primary cesarean delivery rate of 18.5 % compared to 11.8 % in the urban hospitals, p &lt; .0001. Low-risk women who delivered at rural hospitals had significantly higher unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for cesarean delivery. The association with rural hospital was stronger after adjusting for confounders, aOR 2.47 (95 % CI 2.23–2.73) compared to unadjusted OR 1.70 (95 % CI 1.58–1.83) for primary cesarean delivery. Conclusions on practice: In a geographically isolated population, rates of primary cesarean delivery among low-risk women are significantly higher in rural hospitals. This disparity should be investigated further. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Moderate to severe postoperative pain affects performance of daily activities and it contributes to persistent postoperative pain. In patients submitted to cesarean section, this pain can also interfere with women’s ability to care for their babies, to effectively breastfeed, and to satisfactorily interact with their children. Factors influencing the pain perception during the immediate postoperative period have not been widely pursued. Objective. To investigate the incidence and predicting factors of postoperative pain after cesarean section. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study with 1,062 women submitted to cesarean section. We collected sociodemographic, clinical, surgical, and health behavior data. We used the 11-point Numerical Pain and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales. We performed logistic analysis to identify predictors of moderate to severe postoperative pain. Results: The incidence of moderate-severe postoperative pain was 78.4% (CI: 95%: 75.9%–80.8%).The preoperative anxiety (OR = 1.60; CI 95%: 1.22–2.30) and intrathecalmorphine with fentanyl (OR = 0,23; CI 95%: 0.08–0.66) were significantly associated with moderate-severe postoperative pain report. Conclusion: The preoperative anxiety increases the risk of moderate-severe postoperative pain in women submitted to cesarean section. The intrathecal morphine with fentanyl added to bupivacaine was a protective factor against this pain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Early bonding by skin-to-skin contact (SSC) has been demonstrated to be beneficial for mothers and newborns following vaginal delivery. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intraoperative bonding (early SSC) after cesarean section on neonatal adaptation, maternal pain and stress response. Study design: This prospective, randomized-controlled pilot study was performed at a single academic tertiary hospital (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz, Austria) between September 2013 and January 2014. Women were randomly assigned to intraoperative ('early') SCC (n = 17) versus postoperative ('late') SCC (n = 18). Main variables investigated were neonatal transition (Apgar score, arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate and temperature), maternal pain perception and both maternal and neonatal stress response by measuring the stress biomarkers salivary free cortisol and salivary alpha amylase. Results: There was no evidence for differences in parameters reflecting neonatal transition or stress response between the `Early SSC Group' and the `Late SSC Group'. Maternal salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels as well as maternal wellbeing and pain did not differ between the groups. However, the rise of maternal salivary alpha-amylase directly after delivery was higher in the `Early SSC Group' compared to the `Late SSC Group' (p = 0.004). Conclusions: This study did not reveal significant risks for the newborn in terms of neonatal transition when early SSC is applied in the operating room. Maternal condition and stress marker levels did not differ either, although the rise of maternal salivary alpha-amylase directly after delivery was higher in the `Early SSC Group' compared to the `Late SSC Group', which may indicate a stressor sign due to intensive activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullary-system. This needs to be further evaluated in a larger prospective randomized trial. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>This study takes a lifecourse approach to understanding the factors contributing to delivery methods in the US by identifying preconception and pregnancy-related determinants of medically indicated and non-medically indicated cesarean section (C-section) deliveries. Data are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, a nationally representative, population-based survey of women delivering a live baby in 2001 (n = 9,350). Three delivery methods were examined: (1) vaginal delivery (reference); (2) medically indicated C-section; and (3) non-medically indicated C-sections. Using multinomial logistic regression, we examined the role of sociodemographics, health, healthcare, stressful life events, pregnancy complications, and history of C-section on the odds of medically indicated and non-medically indicated C-sections, compared to vaginal delivery. 74.2 % of women had a vaginal delivery, 11.6 % had a non-medically indicated C-section, and 14.2 % had a medically indicated C-section. Multivariable analyses revealed that prior C-section was the strongest predictor of both medically indicated and non-medically indicated C-sections. However, we found salient differences between the risk factors for indicated and non-indicated C-sections. Surgical deliveries continue to occur at a high rate in the US despite evidence that they increase the risk for morbidity and mortality among women and their children. Reducing the number of non-medically indicated C-sections is warranted to lower the short- and long-term risks for deleterious health outcomes for women and their babies across the lifecourse. Healthcare providers should address the risk factors for medically indicated C-sections to optimize low-risk delivery methods and improve the survival, health, and well-being of children and their mothers.

        <ab>Objective: We examined the psychometric properties of three internationally established measures for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in women after vaginal delivery (VD), elective cesarean section (CS), and emergency CS and the relationship of HRQoL scores with blood loss after delivery. Methods: This is a prospective longitudinal study. One hundred forty-one consecutive patients (71 after VD, 36 after elective CS, and 34 after emergency CS) were enrolled in two university hospitals and one general hospital from June 2003 to March 2004. Women completed the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) and the EQ-5D classification of own health between 12 and 24 h after VD or between 24 and 48 h after CS. Subsequent assessments, additionally including the Short Form 36 (SF-36), were made 1, 3, and 6 weeks after delivery. We analyzed feasibility (response, completion time, reported difficulties, item nonresponse), reliability (Cronbach's α), discriminative validity between groups by type of delivery, and responsiveness over time (Wilcoxon's signed rank tests and effect sizes). Results: The MFI, SF-36, and EQ-5D proved to be highly feasible and reliable (α &gt; .7 for all scales of MFI and SF-36). The measures were able to discriminate between groups by mode of delivery and to detect moderate recovery in physical and small recovery in mental status over time in the first 6 weeks after delivery. The suboptimal total questionnaire response of 60% after 6 weeks was attributable to low response among women of non-Dutch ethnic origin. The significant correlation between Hb level and mean physical HRQoL scores found at T = 0 disappeared 1 week postpartum. Conclusion: The combination of MFI, SF-36, and EQ-5D showed good psychometric performance and is a good choice to measure HRQoL after delivery in scientific studies. Development of a shorter set is needed for use in routine clinical practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Childbirth has a significant impact on maternal health, and the high rate of cesarean delivery is a global health concern. Few studies have used validated measures to explore depression, pain, and sexual dysfunction following vaginal or cesarean delivery over a prolonged time period. Objective: We examined the associations between vaginal and cesarean delivery and depressive symptoms, pain, and sexual function during the 1-year postpartum period. Design: A prospective, five-time-point longitudinal study. Setting: Maternity unit at a medical center. Participants: A total of 351 of 736 women completed a questionnaire that described demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, and pain levels at 3–5 days postpartum, and updated personal data, depressive symptoms, pain levels, and sexual function at 4–6 weeks and at 3, 6, and 12 months after delivery. Methods: Differences between the vaginal and cesarean groups in depressive symptoms, pain, and sexual function and trends of changes in these factors over the first postpartum year were examined. Results: Compared with the vaginal birth group, the cesarean birth group had a significantly higher prevalence of depressive symptoms at 3 months (p = 0.03); higher scores for non-localized pain at 3–5 days (p &lt; 0.001), 4–6 weeks (p = 0.03), and 3 months (p = 0.046); higher scores for abdominal pain at 3–5 days (p &lt; 0.001), 4–6 weeks (p &lt; 0.001), and 6 months (p = 0.01); lower perineal pain scores at 3–5 days (p &lt; 0.001); and higher sexual desire scores (p = 0.04) but lower sexual satisfaction scores (p = 0.02) at 4–6 weeks. Differences between the vaginal and cesarean groups were significant (p = 0.01, p = 0.049, respectively) in terms of the decrease in non-localized pain from 3–5 days to 4–6 weeks postpartum and the increase in sexual desire from 4–6 weeks to 3 months postpartum. Conclusions: Cesarean delivery was associated with an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms at 3 months and higher pain levels that persisted at 6 months postpartum in Taiwan. We found no difference in sexual function between vaginal and cesarean delivery after 6 weeks postpartum, and no differences in the trends related to depressive symptoms or in sexual functioning (except for desire) within 1 year postpartum.

        <ab>Background—aims: Pre-pregnancy obesity may cause significant health implications for both mother and neonate. Our study aims to investigate the association between pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index and the risk for cesarean section, admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, macrosomia and preterm delivery, in a Mediterranean country. Study design: A matched retrospective case control analysis was conducted. Subjects: The study population included all pregnant women (with known Body Mass Index data) who gave birth in the University Hospital of Patras between 1st of January 2003 and 31st of December 2008. Outcome measures: Cases were defined as obese (338) or overweight (826) women. Results: Overweight and obese women were at higher risk for cesarean section, NICU admission and preterm delivery (χ²(2) = 36.877, p &lt; 0.001, χ² Imes and Burke (2014) = 6.586, p = 0.037 and χ² Imes and Burke (2014) = 7.227, p = 0.027 respectively). Neonatal mean birthweight was higher among obese and overweight women (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Both obese and overweight pregnancies should be considered as high risk pregnancies, due to more frequent adverse pregnancy outcomes (cesarean delivery, preterm delivery and NICU admission).

        <ab>Comments on an article by Luz Viale et al. (see record [rid]2015-51800-036[/rid]). Viale et al. present the results of their systematic review and metaanalysis of observational studies to assess risks of maternal and fetal complications (excluding malformations and cognitive-behavioral deficits). Viale et al. analyses included 38 studies with 2837325 pregnancies. Women with epilepsy versus those without epilepsy had increased risks for spontaneous miscarriage (odds ratio [OR] 1·54, 95% CI 1·02–2·32), antepartum hemorrhage (1·49, 1·01–2·20), postpartum hemorrhage (1·29, 1·13–1·49), hypertensive disorders (1·37, 1·21–1·55), induction of labor (1·67, 1·31–2·11), caesarean section (1·40, 1·23–1·58), any preterm birth (1·16, 1·01–1·34), and fetal growth restriction (1·26, 1·20–1·33). Viale et al. conclude that epilepsy and exposure to antiepileptic drugs are associated with a small but significant risk for several adverse outcomes during pregnancy. Viale et al. study is well conducted and adds to existing published work by providing improved estimates for several risks during pregnancy in women with epilepsy.

        <ab>Aim: The aim was to explore the relationships between the feelings of women who give birth and several birth-related care conditions, the womens’ socio-demographic background, personality and perceptions of the quality of intrapartum care. Background. Childbirth is a highly significant emotional event for women and it is an explicit goal that each woman should have a positive childbirth experience. Design: The nationwide study is cross-sectional and was conducted at Swedish maternity units over two months in 2007. Methods: The study group consisted of 739 women (63% response rate). A dimensionality analysis of six emotion items was performed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Non-parametric tests and generalised linear mixed effects model analyses were used to study relationships and to make subgroup comparisons. Results: In the SEM analysis, a positive and a negative feeling factor were identified. Strong associations between the feeling factors and the womens’ perceptions of the quality of care were found, particularly in regard to the so-called identity-oriented approach of the midwives and other health professionals. In addition, a higher intensity of negative feelings was associated with a personality pattern characterised by extraversion, emotional instability and lower degree of conscientiousness, a lower level of education and having had delivery through Caesarean section. Conclusions: The positive and negative feelings of women who give birth strongly covary with the women’s perception of the quality of their intrapartum care. This pertains in particular to information issues, the midwives showing commitment, empathy and respect, being present during labour and allowing the women to actively participate as much as they want to. Relevance to clinical practice. Subgroup differences indicate that midwives should pay increased attention to childbearing women who have primary school education only, a lower emotional stability and/or deliver through Caesarean section.

        <ab>This paper reports on current initiation and prevalence rates, in Western Australia, differentiating ‘any’ breastfeeding with ‘exclusive’ breastfeeding whilst exploring patterns and reasons for stopping breastfeeding. The results presented are part of a larger study examining women’s perceptions of care and wellbeing in the early postnatal period. A cross sectional survey was used to examine infant feeding practices during the hospital stay and at 9 weeks post birth from Western Australian women with a registered live birth between February and June 2006. Data obtained from 2,669 women revealed a 93% (n = 2,472) initiation rate of any breastfeeding. More multiparous women (73.5%) were exclusively breastfeeding in hospital compared to primiparous women (65.2%), which decreased to 57.1 and 49.2%, respectively at 9 weeks. Of those who had ceased by 9 weeks, more multiparous women (71.1%) ceased before 3 weeks. Reasons cited for ceasing in order of frequency were insufficient milk supply, infant related reasons, pain and discomfort and emotional reasons. Younger maternal age, primiparous women, lower maternal education levels, offering a combination of breast milk and formula in hospital and caesarean birth were significant independent predictors of early cessation. Although initiation rates including 'any' breast milk are meeting NHMRC dietary guidelines of 90%, the 60% target of exclusive breastfeeding is not being achieved for 3 months or in fact at 9 weeks. Targeted support for at risk groups such as younger, less well-educated, primiparous women must continue. Evidence based policies to protect breastfeeding must address the practice of offering formula to breastfed infants in hospital and the impact of increasing interventions such as caesarean births.

        <ab>Background: Animal research demonstrates that pelvic sensory signalling at parturition initiates behavioural and emotional changes that are protective for mother and offspring. In contrast, research with humans has found no effect of caesarean delivery (i.e. procedure that blocks pelvic signalling) on mother’s mental health. The lack of effect may reflect little consideration for the use of epidurals, another intervention that blocks pelvic signalling. The following study examines whether blocking pelvic signalling during delivery predicts postpartum depression symptomatology. Method: Longitudinal mental health data were collected prospectively from 142 primiparous women who had a caesarean delivery and/or received epidural anaesthesia (Intervention) or delivered vaginally without anaesthesia (No-Intervention). Measurements began in late pregnancy and continued through the first postpartum year. Results: Intervention mothers reported more depressive symptoms at the end of the first postpartum year compared to those in the No-Intervention group. This effect was independent of socio-cultural factors known to predict levels of depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These results suggest that pelvic sensory signalling may help to prepare women for the postpartum period. Considering there are many factors influencing the mental health of mothers, the present finding suggest that populations vulnerable to postpartum depression should consider a delivery without intervention, when medically permissible.

        <ab>The remarkable increase in Vietnamese economic conditions can increase the birth weight in neonates and better delivery practices among women. The Chi Linh Health and Demographic Surveillance System started in 2004. An open cohort of data consisting of about 57 561 people from 17 993 households has been followed primarily with respect to demography, economy, and education. The aim of this research is to study secular trends in delivery practice and birth weight in the past decade (2005-2012) in Chi Linh. We found a significant change in delivery rates at hospitals and cesarean section rates, but the birth weights over a decade of drastic economic development were stable. Furthermore, the findings show significant associations of birth weight and delivery practices with the child’s sex, mother’s age, and household income. Our results might be considered as representative for other similar periurban settings in Vietnam. We suggest that appropriate policies should be developed given the reduction in the use of delivery services in commune health centers in urban areas.

        <ab>Background: Breastfeeding is an important determinant of early infant immune function and potentially future health. Although numerous studies have reported rising breastfeeding initiation rates and duration, few longitudinally investigated the impact of shifting societal and lifestyle factors on breastfeeding patterns in developed nations. Methods: The Ulm Birth Cohort Study (UBCS) and Ulm SPATZ Health Study (SPATZ) cohorts consist of newborns and their mothers recruited, respectively, from 2000 to 2001 and 2012 to 2013 at the University Medical Center Ulm, Germany. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate crude and mutually adjusted hazard ratios for study effect (time trend) and individual risk factors on noninitiation and duration of predominant and total breastfeeding. Results: Compared with UBCS mothers, SPATZ mothers had lower cessation rates of both predominant breastfeeding by 4 months and total breastfeeding by 6 months: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.79 (0.67–0.93) and 0.71 (0.60–0.82), respectively. However, this crude time trend was limited to mothers with higher educational achievement. Similar time trend effects were observed among less educated mothers only after adjustment for early cessation risk factors. Mutually adjusted hazard ratios for individual risk factors were similar in both studies: low education, high BMI, smoking within 6 weeks of delivery, and cesarean delivery were associated with early breastfeeding cessation beginning at 6 weeks. In addition, actively abstaining from drinking alcohol was associated with lower rates of early cessation. Conclusions: Our results suggest widening socioeconomic disparity in breastfeeding and potentially subsequent child health, which may require new targeted interventions.

        <ab>Objectives: Given that prepartum psychiatric symptoms have been reported to be associated with postpartum disorders, focusing on the prepartum period appears of prime importance. The aim of the current study was threefold: (a) to identify the prevalence rates of women suffering from fear of childbirth (FOC) and tokophobia (b) to explore the association between FOC, obstetrical and psychopathological variables and (c) to identify the independent predictors of the intensity of FOC symptoms, FOC and tokophobia. Methods: at 36 weeks’ gestation, 98 women completed questionnaires assessing FOC, pretraumatic stress, fear of pain, depressive and anxiety symptomatology as well as perceived social support. Socio-demographic and gynecological data were also gathered. Results: 22.45% of women reported a probable FOC and 20.41% suffered from a potential tokophobia. Epidural anesthesia (ß = 5.62, p &lt; 0.05), and the intensity of pretraumatic stress symptoms (ß = 0.69, p &lt; 0.05), were independently associated with the intensity of FOC symptoms. Planning a c-section was significantly related to FOC (β = 0.09, p = 0.03). Planning an epidural anesthesia was also an independent predictor of both FOC and tokophobia (β = 1.33, p = 0.03; β = 1.26, p = 0.04, respectively). Conclusions: Given the high rates of FOC and tokophobia highlighted, developing an appropriate preparation to childbirth is of great relevance. Longitudinal studies should be developed in order to provide an in-depth examination of the course of prepartum psychiatric disorders, maintenance of symptoms and their impact on subsequent infant development.

        <ab>The West African country of Mali implemented referral systems to increase spatial access to emergency obstetrical care and lower maternal mortality. We test the hypothesis that spatial access- proxied by travel time during the rainy and dry seasons- is associated with in-hospital maternal mortality. Effect modification by caesarean section is explored. All women treated for emergency obstetrical complications at the referral hospital in Kayes, Mali were considered eligible for study. First, we conducted descriptive analyses of all emergency obstetrical complications treated at the referral hospital between 2005 and 2007. We calculated case fatality rates by obstetric diagnosis and travel time. Key informant interviews provided travel times. Medical registers provided clinical and demographic data. Second, a matched case–control study assessed the independent effect of travel time on maternal mortality. Stratification was used to explore effect modification by caesarean section. Case fatality rates increased with increasing travel time to the hospital. After controlling for age, diagnosis, and date of arrival, a travel time of four or more hours was significantly associated with in-hospital maternal mortality (OR: 3.83; CI: 1.31–11.27). Travel times between 2 and 4 h were associated with increased odds of maternal mortality (OR 1.88), but the relationship was not significant. The effect of travel time on maternal mortality appears to be modified by caesarean section. Poor spatial access contributes to maternal mortality even in women who reach a health facility. Improving spatial access will help women arrive at the hospital in time to be treated effectively. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: In South Korea, cesarean section rates (i.e., the proportion of all live births delivered by cesarean section) approached 40 percent in 2000. The relative contribution of physicians and women to this high rate has been a source of debate. This study explored attitudes toward mode of delivery among South Korean women. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional telephone survey of 505 Korean women aged 20 to 49 years was conducted using a proportionate quota and systematic random sampling method. The response rate was 57.3 percent. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire consisting of 7 questions about vaginal and cesarean delivery. Results: Over 95 percent of women preferred vaginal delivery during pregnancy and were willing to recommend this method to others. Of the women who delivered by cesarean section, 10.6 percent stated that they had requested a cesarean birth. Attitudes toward vaginal or cesarean delivery differed significantly according to a woman's education level. Conclusions: Most study participants showed more favorable attitudes toward vaginal delivery than cesarean delivery. This result does not support the assumption that the upsurge of cesarean section rates in South Korea is associated with women's positive attitudes toward cesarean section. The main cause of the rapid rise of cesarean section rates in South Korea during the past two decades have its origins in health care practitioners and the health care system in which they work.

        <ab>Objective: To examine incidence and severity of cerebral palsy (CP), and associated factors among preterm survivors (gestational age &lt;34 weeks), admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit from 1990–2005. Study design: Eighteen antenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors were analyzed. The cohort was divided in four birth periods: 1990–1993 (n = 661), 1994–1997 (n = 726), 1998–2001 (n = 723), and 2002–2005 (n = 850). The Gross Motor Function Classification System was used as primary outcome measure (mean age: 32.9 ± 5.3 months). Logistic regression analyses were used. Results: CP incidence decreased from 6.5% in period I, to 2.6%, 2.9% and 2.2% (P &lt; .001) in period II-IV, respectively. Simultaneously, cystic periventricular leukomalacia (c-PVL) decreased from 3.3% in period I to 1.3% in period IV (P = .004). Within the total cohort (n = 3287), c-PVL grade III decreased from 2.3% in period I to 0.2% in period IV (P = .003). The number of children with Gross Motor Function Classification System levels III-V decreased from period I to IV (P =.035). Independent risk factors for CP were c-PVL and severe intraventricular hemorrhage,whereas antenatal antibiotics, presence of an arterial line, Caesarean section, and gestational age were independent protective factors. Conclusion: CP incidence and severity decreased from 1990–1993 onward, which could be attributed to a reduction of 93% in severe c-PVL.

        <ab>Aims: We investigated the involvement of first-time mothers, who had a planned Caesarean section, in the decision to have a Caesarean section, taking into account their different educational levels. Subjects and methods: A self-assessment questionnaire was sent in July 2005 to women who had undergone a Caesarean section in 2004. Participants were 2,685 members of a statutory health insurance fund who had given birth by Caesarean section (response rate: 48.0%). Included were primiparae with planned Caesarean section (n = 352). Results: The women in this cross-sectional study felt well informed about the procedure of a section but not its consequences. They used several sources of information and were most satisfied with the information provided by doctors and midwives. Of the women in this study 20% did not have a midwife. No major differences were observed between different educational levels. Conclusion: Although most women were satisfied with their decision, they felt that they did not receive enough information about the consequences of a Caesarean section. This information need could be met by a further involvement of midwives in maternity care. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the effect of implementing hospital policies aimed at reducing elective labor induction and increasing spontaneous labor rates. Data Sources: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Dissertation Abstracts International. Study Selection: Observational studies published from 2000 to 2010 were the only original studies from the past 20 years that met the review criteria. These focused on elective induction, labor induction policies, pre- and postimplementation of labor induction policy outcomes, and cesarean and maternal/neonatal morbidity rates. Data Extraction: Six retrospective and three prospective observational studies regarding implementation of labor induction policies were reviewed for types of intervention guidelines implemented and outcomes on rates of induction, cesarean, and maternal/neonatal morbidity. Data Synthesis: Implementation of elective induction policies resulted in lower induction, cesarean, operative/ instrumental vaginal delivery, and maternal/neonatal morbidity rates. Patients spontaneously gave birth before scheduled elective induction date after policies were implemented, thereby resulting in lower rates of elective induction. Conclusions: Elective labor induction policies should be developed and implemented in all labor and delivery units. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: External cephalic version (ECV) reduces the chance of breech presentation at term birth and lowers the chance of a cesarean delivery. ECV services are now in place in many units in the United Kingdom but their effectiveness is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons for breech presentation at term birth. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 394 consecutive babies who were in breech presentation at term birth in a large United Kingdom maternity unit that offers ECV. The cohort was analyzed over two time periods 10 years apart: 1998–1999 and 2008–2009. Results: Only 33.8 percent of women had undergone a (failed) ECV attempt. This low proportion was mainly because breech presentation was not diagnosed antenatally (27.9%). Other contributing factors were: ECV not offered by clinicians (12.2%), ECV declined by women (14%), and contraindications to ECV (10.7%). Over the 10-year period, the proportion of breech presentations that were not diagnosed antenatally increased from 23.2 to 32.5 percent (p = 0.04), which constituted 52.8 percent of women who had not undergone an ECV attempt in 2008–2009. Failure of clinicians to offer ECV reduced from 21.6 to 3.0 percent (p = 0.0001) and the proportion of women declining ECV decreased from 19.1 to 9.0 percent (p = 0.005). Overall, ECV attempts increased from 28.9 to 38.5 percent (p = 0.05). Conclusions: Although ECV counseling, referral, and attempt rates have increased, failure to detect breech presentation antenatally is the principal barrier to successful ECV. Improved breech detection would have a greater impact than methods to increase ECV success rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: We report the main findings of the WHO Multicountry Survey on Maternal and Newborn Health (WHOMCS), which aimed to assess the burden of complications related to pregnancy, the coverage of key maternal health interventions, and use of the maternal severity index (MSI) in a global network of health facilities. Methods: In our cross-sectional study, we included women attending health facilities in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East that dealt with at least 1000 childbirths per year and had the capacity to provide caesarean section. We obtained data from analysis of hospital records for all women giving birth and all women who had a severe maternal outcome (SMO; ie, maternal death or maternal near miss). We regarded coverage of key maternal health interventions as the proportion of the target population who received an indicated intervention (eg, the proportion of women with eclampsia who received magnesium sulphate). We used areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROC) with 95% CI to externally validate a previously reported MSI as an indicator of severity. We assessed the overall performance of care (ie, the ability to produce a positive effect on health outcomes) through standardised mortality ratios. Results: From May 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2011, we included 314 623 women attending 357 health facilities in 29 countries (2538 had a maternal near miss and 486 maternal deaths occurred). The mean period of data collection in each health facility was 89 days (SD 21). 23 015 (7·3%) women had potentially life-threatening disorders and 3024 (1·0%) developed an SMO. 808 (26·7%) women with an SMO had post-partum haemorrhage and 784 (25·9%) had preeclampsia or eclampsia. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and coagulation dysfunctions were the most frequent organ dysfunctions in women who had an SMO. Reported mortality in countries with a high or very high maternal mortality ratio was two-to-three-times higher than that expected for the assessed severity despite a high coverage of essential interventions. The MSI had good accuracy for maternal death prediction in women with markers of organ dysfunction (AUROC 0·826 [95% CI 0·802–0·851]). Interpretation: High coverage of essential interventions did not imply reduced maternal mortality in the health-care facilities we studied. If substantial reductions in maternal mortality are to be achieved, universal coverage of lifesaving interventions need to be matched with comprehensive emergency care and overall improvements in the quality of maternal health care. The MSI could be used to assess the performance of health facilities providing care to women with complications related to pregnancy.

        <ab>The aim of this study was to describe women’s feelings, attitudes and beliefs about different modes of childbirth. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the obstetrics clinics of Ege University and Dr Ekrem Hayri Ustundag Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital in Izmir, Turkey. Three-hundred forty-two women who had given birth via spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) or caesarean section (C/S) between June and December 2009 voluntarily agreed to participate. Fifty-seven per cent of participants were aged 20–24. Sixty per cent of the women (n = 205) had undergone C/S during their last delivery; among these women, the birth method of 90% (n = 185) was decided by their doctors, whereas the remaining 10% (n = 20) made the decision themselves or with their partners. Sixty-three per cent (n = 250) of women who underwent C/S said that if they gave birth again, they would prefer to deliver via SVD. Eighty-eight per cent (n = 300) of women wanted the legal right to choose their birth method. Although the rate of C/S was high, most women stated that if given the choice, they would prefer a SVD if they had another child. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Little is known about birth outcomes for HIV-infected women in India. We examine maternal and neonatal birth outcomes in HIV-infected women within the context of enhanced pre-natal care associated with a randomized clinical trial conducted in Pune, India. Birth outcomes of 212 HIV-infected pregnant women were compared with those of 130 HIV-uninfected pregnant women attending a government tertiary care hospital between 2002 and 2004. These women and children were participating in the Six Week Extended-Dose Nevirapine (SWEN) study. Birth outcomes and maternal morbidity data were collected at delivery. We found no differences between HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women with respect to the proportion with elevated intrapartum blood pressure, eclampsia, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, or caesarean section (p&gt;0.05). HIV-infected women were more likely to have peri-partum fever (3% versus 0%, p = 0.04). There were no differences in neonatal parameters such as low birth weight (LBW), infants who were small for gestational age, or those having congenital anomalies (p&gt;0.05). Compared with infants of HIV-infected women enrolled antenatally, infants of HIV-infected women enrolled in the post-partum ward had a higher risk of pre-term delivery (20% versus 8%, p = 0.02) and LBW (41% versus 22%, p = 0.002). HIV-infected women in this cohort in India were not found to have significant negative birth outcomes. Antenatal care was important as those not having received any antenatal care prior to deliver were at increased risk of having a pre-term delivery or an infant with LBW. Based on these data, regular antenatal care provided to HIV-infected women can reduce risk of adverse birth outcomes for their infants.

        <ab>Background: Routine oropharyngeal suctioning in term vigorous neonates immediately after birth is a questionable practice. Current recommendations favor suctioning only in the presence of considerable obstruction due to secretions, blood or other matter. We aimed to analyze the influence of oropharyngeal suctioning on cerebral and peripheral muscle oxygenation in term neonates during transition immediately after birth. Methods: We included term neonates after elective cesarean section for this prospective observational study. Oropharyngeal suctioning was performed based on the clinicians' judgment of threatening airway obstruction. From a total of 138 enrolled neonates, 36 were suctioned and then compared to 36 controls matched for gestational age. Heart rate (HR) and pre/postductal arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2pre/SpO2post) were measured by pulse oximetry. Cerebral (rSO2brain) and pre/postductal peripheral muscle tissue oxygenation (rSO2pre/rSO2post) were measured by near infrared spectroscopy during the first 15 min of life. Results: All neonates in both groups experienced normal postnatal transition with normal Apgar scores (Apgar 9/10/10) and with no events of apnea or bradycardia induced by suctioning. SpO2pre values were slightly lower at 2 and 4min after birth. Suctioning had no main and interaction effect on HR, SpO2post, rSO2brain, rSO2pre and rSO2post in the first 15 min after birth. Conclusion: In the present study we were able to show that, in term neonates, when correctly indicated, immediate postnatal oropharyngeal suctioning does not compromise cerebral and peripheral muscle tissue oxygenation. However, any suction maneuver must be performed with caution and strict indication during neonatal transition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Inadvertent hypothermia is common in patients undergoing surgical procedures with a reported prevalence of perioperative hypothermia ranging from 50% to 90%. Hypothermia within the perioperative environment may have many undesired physiological effects that are associated with postoperative morbidity. There are different options for treating and/or preventing hypothermia within the adult perioperative environment, which include active and passive warming methods. This systematic review was undertaken to provide comprehensive evidence on the most effective strategies for prevention and management of inadvertent hypothermia in the perioperative environment. Objective: The objective of this review was to identify the most effective methods for the treatment and/or preventions of hypothermia in intraoperative or postoperative patients. Inclusion criteria: Adult patients ≥18 years of age, who underwent any type of surgery were included in this review. Types of interventions included were any type of linen or cover, aluminium foil wraps, forced‐air warming devices, radiant warming devices and fluid warming devices. This review considered all identified prospective studies that used a clearly described process for randomisation, and/or included a control group. The primary outcome of interest was change in core body temperature. Review methods: Two independent reviewers assessed methodological validity of papers selected for retrieval and any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Results: Nineteen studies with a combined 1451 patients who underwent different surgical procedures were included in this review. Meta‐analysis was not possible. Forced‐air warming in pregnant women scheduled for caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia prevented maternal and foetal hypothermia. Intravenous and irrigating fluids warmed (38–40°C) to a temperature higher than that of room temperature by different fluid warming devices (both dry and water heated) proved significantly beneficial to patients in terms of stable haemodynamic variables, and higher core temperature at the end of the surgery. Water garment warmer was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) effective than forced‐air warming in maintaining intraoperative normothermia in orthotopic liver transplantation patients. Extra warming with forced air compared to routine thermal care was effective in reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections and postoperative cardiac complications. Passive warming with reflective heating blankets or elastic bandages wrapped around the legs tightly were found to be ineffective in reducing the incidence or magnitude of hypothermia. Conclusion: There are significant benefits associated with forced‐air warming. Evidence supports commencement of active warming preoperatively and monitoring it throughout the intraoperative period. Single strategies such as forced‐air warming were more effective than passive warming; however, combined strategies, including preoperative commencement, use of warmed fluids plus forced‐air warming as other active strategies were more effective in vulnerable groups (age or durations of surgeries). Implications for practice: •Use active warming strategies •Commence warming preoperatively •In extended surgeries or aged patients use multiple active warming strategies •Warm fluids designated for intraoperative administration •Consider pharmacotherapeutic strategies in preference to no treatment/prevention Implications for research: Future research should focus on large, high quality randomised controlled trials looking at long‐term clinical outcomes, operating temperature forced‐air warming devices, different body sites and percentage of body coverage area of active warming.

        <ab>Introduction: Exploring the hypothesis that 'sexual function' is associated with mode of delivery is important, because sexual health is an integral part of general health. Aim: The aim of this study was to quantify the relationship between mode of delivery and subsequent incidence of sexual dysfunction and impairment of quality of life (QOL) both in women and their husbands. Main Outcome Measures: Sexual function of pregnant women and their husbands was assessed using Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), respectively. All women and their husbands were also asked to indicate their sexual satisfaction on a scale of 0–5 as proposed by Kim and Paick. QOL was also assessed by Short Form-36 Health Survey. Methods: A total of 912 pregnant women (mean age 26 ± 2, range 21–32 years, parity I) and their husbands were recruited in this prospective study. The subjects were subdivided into five groups according to their mode of delivery, including: group A, spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) without injuries (group SVD, N = 184); group B, vaginal delivery with episiotomy (VDE) or perineal laceration (group VDE, N = 182); group C, operative vaginal delivery (OVD) (instrumental delivery) (group OVD, N = 180), group D, planned cesarean section (PCS) (group PCS, N = 182); and group E, emergency cesarean section (ECS) (group ECS, N = 184). Results: Of women in groups A, B, C, D, and E, 72 (42.6%), 62 (37.1%), 54 (32.7%), 108 (64.3%), and 64 (38.3%) resumed sexual intercourse (SI) within 8 weeks after delivery.Women with vaginal delivery and emergency cesarean section had statistically significant lower FSFI scores as compared with PCS women.Women who experienced a PCS had lowest pain scores, and women who had OVD had highest pain scores at first SI (P = 0.001). The IIEF domains scores for erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction with sex life did differ significantly between particular groups. The research has shown that the QOL parameters for PCS women were generally higher than for the other groups, and this concerns almost all categories. Conclusions: In healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies at term, instrumental deliveries are associated with the highest and PCS associated with the lowest rate of long-term maternal and paternal sexual dysfunction.

        <ab>Background: Research has yielded little understanding of factors associated with high cesarean rates among migrant women (i.e., women born abroad). The objective of this study was to identify medical, migration, social, and health service predictors of unplanned cesareans among low-risk migrant women from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: We used a case–control research design. The sampling frame included migrant women from LMICs living in Canada less than 8 years, who gave birth at one of three Montreal hospitals between March 2014 and January 2015. Data were collected from medical records and by interview-administration of the Migrant-Friendly Maternity Care Questionnaire. We performed multi-variable logistic regression for low-risk women (i.e., vertex, singleton, term pregnancies) who delivered vaginally (1,615 controls) and by unplanned cesarean indicated by failure to progress, fetal distress, or cephalopelvic disproportion (233 cases). Results: Predictors of unplanned cesarean included being from sub-Saharan Africa/Caribbean (OR 2.37 [95% CI 1.02–5.51]) and admission for delivery during early labor (OR 5.43 [95% CI 3.17–9.29]). Among women living in Canada less than 2 years predictors were having a humanitarian migration classification (OR 4.24 [95% CI 1.16–15.46]) and admission for delivery during early labor (OR 7.68 [95% CI 3.12–18.88]). Conclusion: Migrant women from sub-Saharan Africa/Caribbean and recently arrived migrant women with a humanitarian classification are at greater risk for unplanned cesareans compared with other low-risk migrant women from LMICs after controlling for medical factors. Strategies to prevent cesareans should consider the circumstances of migrant women that may be contributing to the use of unplanned cesareans in this population.

        <ab>Objective: To compare the neurobehavior of neonates born to adolescent mothers with and without depression during gestation. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study included healthy term neonates born to adolescent mothers with untreated depression during gestation, without exposure to legal or illicit drugs, and compared them with infants born to adolescent mothers without psychiatric disorders. Maternal psychiatric diagnoses were assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1) and neonatal neurobehavior by the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) at 24 to 72 hours of life. Neurobehavioral outcomes were analyzed by ANOVA adjusted for confounders. Results: 37 infants born to mothers with depression during gestation were compared to 332 infants born to mothers without psychiatric disorders. Infants of mothers with depression had smaller head circumferences. Significant interactions of maternal depression and male gender, gestational age &gt; 40 weeks, regional anesthesia during delivery, vaginal delivery, and infant head circumference ≥ 34 cm were found. Worse performance was noted in the following neonatal neurobehavioral parameters: arousal, excitability, lethargy, hypotonicity, and signs of stress and abstinence. Conclusion: Infants born to adolescent mothers with depression exhibit some behavioral changes in the first days of life. These changes are associated with infant sex, gestational age, type of anesthesia, mode of delivery, and head circumference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The objective was to evaluate the potential influence of oxytocin administered during delivery on children’s development at the age of 5. Method: This study was designed as a retrospective cohort study where children from patients given synthetic oxytocin during delivery were considered as the exposed cohort and children from patients not given oxytocin as the nonexposed cohort. From a total of 7465 births attended at our maternity ward in 2006, an initial sample of 400 was randomly selected. A total of 148 children were evaluated using the Battelle Developmental Inventory. Potential confounding and adjustment factors were analyzed using stratified analysis and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). Results: Oxytocin use did not significantly affect the overall risk of developmental delay in the study sample (relative risk, RR, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, CI [0.79–2.71]). The best fit regression model included twin delivery, type of delivery, and maternal age. In the group of vaginal noninstrumental deliveries, oxytocin administration increased the risk of poor Battelle Developmental Inventory outcome, particularly when maternal age was under 28 or over 35 years of age (odds ratio, OR, 67.14; 95% CI [5.46–824.86]). When delivery was instrumental or through cesarean section in mothers aged 28–35 years, oxytocin administration decreased the risk of developmental disorders (OR 0.16; 95% CI [0.04–0.66]). Conclusion: Although oxytocin administration during delivery did not affect the overall risk of low Battelle Developmental Inventory scores in the study sample, some effects were seen according to maternal age and type of birth.

        <ab>This interview study of mothers with 3-month-old infants sought to determine factors associated with maternal negative emotional expression regarding their infants. In a cross-sectional study, 179 mothers were given a shortened version of the Five Minute Speech Sample technique, requesting that they speak for only 2 minutes about their child and their relationship. Negative comments about the infant, maternal health prior to and since the birth, and the impact of the infant on her life were coded. They also completed attitudinal questionnaires and reported on marital relationships and the infant's health and temperament. A Caesarean section, infant illness, current maternal depressive symptoms, fussy infant temperament, and lack of enjoyment of feeding were all independently associated with negative remarks. Depression, infant illness and fussy temperament were all independent predictors of negative remarks about the infant, and Caesarean section and time in Special Care Baby Unit were independent predictors of negative remarks about maternal health and well-being. This kind of open-ended enquiry could be adapted for use in routine clinical contact with mothers of new infants to identify those who may need support.

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 90(5) of Early Human Development (see record [rid]2014-12134-014[/rid]). In the original article, the affiliation of Francesco Cavallin was incorrectly given. The corrected affiliation of the author is present in the erratum.] Background: The potential that obesity in pregnancy has to affect symptoms associated with eating disorders and breastfeeding is unclear. Aim: This study analyzed symptoms of eating disorders and breastfeeding practices in obese mothers. Study design: Prospective, case–control study. Subjects: Participants included 25 obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m²) and 25 normal-weight puerperae, matched for parity and delivery route. Outcome measures: The participants completed the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2), investigating cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms of eating disorders before they were discharged from the maternity hospital and later participated in telephone interviews concerning breastfeeding practices which were classified according to WHO definitions. Results: Although none of the scores fell in the pathological range, the obese mothers had more and more pronounced symptoms of eating disorders in all EDI-2 subscales with respect to normal-weight mothers. They had, in particular, significantly higher scores in body dissatisfaction (p &lt; .0001), ineffectiveness (p = .004), interoceptive awareness (p = .005), and maturity fear (p = .007). Finally, while breastfeeding practices were similar in the two groups, the obese mothers were more likely to maintain full breastfeeding at 6 months (20 vs 8%) and their tendency to postpone weaning was found to be significant (p &lt; .04). Conclusions: While the obese mothers studied have more pronounced symptoms of eating disorders with respect to their normal-weight counterparts, they tended to maintain breastfeeding longer, postponing weaning.

        <ab>Background: The conceptualization and measurement of socio-economic status (SES) is difficult in developing settings. In the absence of SES indices for women in rural China, we constructed SES indices for prenatal care research, and examined their relation to perinatal care and outcomes. Methods: This study utilized data of 4364 rural women having recently given birth, collected by a cross-sectional survey in three rural Chinese provinces in 2007. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to construct the SES indices and multilevel logistic regression was use to relate the indices to low birthweight, short exclusive breastfeeding (≤4 months), childbirth at the county or higher level health facility, caesarean section, inadequate prenatal care and no postnatal care. Results: Three separate SES indices (wealth, occupational and educational indices) were obtained from the PCA analysis, capturing maternal, paternal and household SES characteristics. After adjusting for individual level factors, village and township wealth, higher levels of the indices were inversely associated with inadequate prenatal care. Higher occupational status was positively associated with short exclusive breastfeeding and childbirth at the county or higher level health facility, but inversely associated with no postnatal care. Higher educational status was positively associated with no postnatal care. Conclusion: Three SES indices (wealth, occupational and educational) were obtained from this study for prenatal care research. The indices gave mostly varying results on their associations with perinatal care and outcomes, indicating that SES measures may be outcome-specific.

        <ab>Pregnant women giving birth in Nepal need to use out-of-pocket payment for delivery care services due to a lack of insurance policies. The objective of this study was to examine the ability of pregnant Nepalese women to pay for delivery care services and the effects of the current household health expenditure on impoverishment due to hospital-based delivery services, especially normal delivery (ND) and caesarean section (CS). A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to August 2009 at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. Ability to pay was defined as the current health spending being less than 5% of annual household income. Poverty occurred when a household's per capita income fell to less than US$1 per day. Impoverishment was considered as poverty headcount and normalised poverty gap. On average, the percentage of annual household income spent on current delivery care was 5.9% in the ND group and 9.7% in the CS group. The CS group had a stronger impoverishment effect resulting in a high per cent change of payment-induced poverty headcount by 78.1% and poverty gap by 97.3% compared to 7.7 and 24.1% in the ND group, respectively. There is a strong need to develop a well-prepared financial system to prevent the issue of poverty and impoverishment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The epidemic of Caesarean section (CS) is worldwide, and it has been argued that it is mainly due to non-medical factors, including healthcare financing patterns.We investigated the use of CS in rural China and the related factors, particularly health insurance in the form of the New Co-operative Medical Scheme introduced in 2003. A cross-sectional survey of women who gave birth in 2008-2009 was conducted in five rural counties in central and western China. Of the 5049 new mothers, 73% were interviewed. The association between health insurance coverage and self-reported CS (divided into emergency and non-emergency CS) were examined by cross-tabulation and logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, education, occupation, household income, previous abortions, parity and type of birth health facility. We found that 46% of all births (3550) were CSs, with 13% having an emergency and 33% a non-emergency CS. Women reported that half of the non-emergency CSs were recommended by a doctor and half were requested by themselves. In those counties with mid-range CS rates (28%-63%), health insurance coverage was associated with having CS, and particularly with having non-emergency CS. In those counties with the highest (82%) and lowest (13%) rate, there was no statistically significant association. The findings suggest that health insurance coverage may have facilitated the overuse of CS. Further studies are needed to develop appropriate interventions to reduce non-medically indicated CS, focussing on payment mechanisms, healthcare provider practice patterns, and maternal requests.

        <ab>Background: Maternal perinatal mental health has been shown to be associated with adverse consequences for the mother and the child. However, studies considering the effect of DSM-IV anxiety disorders beyond maternal self-perceived distress during pregnancy and its timing are lacking. Aims: To examine the role of maternal anxiety disorders with an onset before birth and self-perceived distress during pregnancy for unfavourable maternal, obstetric, neonatal and childhood outcomes. Study design: DSM-IV mental disorders and self-perceived distress of 992 mothers as well as obstetric, neonatal and childhood outcomes of their offspring were assessed in a cohort sampled from the community using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Logistic regression analyses revealed associations (odds ratios) between maternal anxiety disorders and self-perceived distress during pregnancy with maternal depression after birth and a range of obstetric, neonatal and childhood psychopathological outcomes. Results: Lifetime maternal anxiety disorders were related to offspring anxiety disorders, but not to offspring externalizing disorders. Analyses focussing on maternal DSM-IV anxiety disorders before birth yielded associations with incident depression after birth. In addition, self-perceived distress during pregnancy was associated with maternal depression after birth, preterm delivery, caesarean section, separation anxiety disorder, ADHD, and conduct disorder in offspring. Conclusion: Findings confirm the transmission of anxiety disorders from mother to offspring. Apart from maternal anxiety, self-perceived distress during pregnancy also emerged as a putative risk factor for adverse outcomes. The finding that maternal anxiety disorders before birth yielded less consistent associations, suggests that self-perceived distress during pregnancy might be seen as a putative moderator/mediator in the familial transmission of anxiety.

        <ab>Using a 3-year nationwide population-based database, this study aims to examine the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with migraines, including low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, infants born small for gestational age, Caesarean section (CS) and pre-eclampsia. We identified a total of 4911 women with migraines who gave birth from 2001 to 2003, together with 24 555 matched women as a comparison cohort. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that after adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratios were 1.16 [95% confidence intervals (CI)= 1.03– 1.31, P = 0.014] for LBW, 1.24 (95% CI = 1.13–1.39, P&lt;0.001) for preterm births, 1.16 (95% CI = 1.07–1.24, P &lt; 0.001) for CS and 1.34 (95% CI = 1.02–1.77, P = 0.027) for pre-eclampsia for women with migraines compared with unaffected mothers. We conclude that women with migraines were at increased risk of having LBW, preterm babies, pre-eclampsia and delivery by CS, compared with unaffected mothers.

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate pregnancy outcomes in Centering Pregnancy patients. Methods: This was an IRB-approved retrospective cohort study from November 2009 to January 2013 involving 202 Centering Pregnancy patients and 202 Certified Nurse Midwife patients. The primary outcome was mean gestational age at time of delivery. Secondary outcomes included cesarean and operative vaginal delivery rate, triage visit frequency, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission rate, 1 and 5 minute APGAR scores, birth weight, breastfeeding rate at discharge and 6 weeks postpartum, third and fourth degree laceration rate, weight gain in pregnancy, and excessive weight gain rate. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in any obstetric outcome including preterm delivery rate. Centering Pregnancy patients were more likely to be active duty (52.0 vs. 35.6%, p = 0.001), younger (24.8 vs. 26.3 years old, p &lt; 0.001), and nulliparous (75.2 vs. 56.9%, p &lt; 0.001). There was a statistically significant increase in triage visit frequency ≥ 6 for Centering Pregnancy patients (11.9% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.011). Conclusions: There were no clinically significant differences in the primary or secondary outcomes. Significant cost savings could be realized by expanding Centering Pregnancy in the military health system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to assess induction rates, maternal, and neonatal outcomes following adoption of a policy prohibiting elective inductions at less than 39 weeks gestation and inductions between 39 and 41 weeks with an unfavorable cervix. A retrospective cohort study of all deliveries greater than or equal to 37 weeks gestation was conducted 1 year prior to through 1 year after implementation of the induction policy. Induction rates before and after the policy were calculated as the primary outcome while maternal and neonatal conditions were assessed as secondary outcomes. Elective inductions (p = 0.016), elective inductions less than 39 weeks gestation (p = 0.020), and elective inductions 39–40 weeks and 6 days gestation with an unfavorable cervix (p = 0.031) decreased significantly following adoption of the policy. Maternal and neonatal outcomes, including rates of cesarean deliveries, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions remained unchanged, though this study was not adequately powered to detect differences in these outcomes. An institutional induction policy was associated with a reduction in elective inductions prior to 39 weeks and up to 40 weeks and 6 days with an unfavorable cervix. These reductions were not accompanied by change in maternal or neonatal outcomes at our institution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Breastfeeding has many advantages for both mothers and infants. Several factors related to the mother and the baby, however, have a negative effect on the initiation of breastfeeding. Mode of delivery is one of these factors. When delivery takes place by cesarean section, the mother becomes a surgical patient with all the inherent risks and problems. Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia rates are currently rising our country, but the effects of this factor on the initiation and duration of breastfeeding are unclear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the breastfeeding process in mothers who had cesarean deliveries (CD) with those who delivered vaginally (VD). Design: This study is an observational and comparative study. Setting: The environment of the research was the private hospital in Istanbul. Participants: The samples in the research were volunteer participant mothers who were delivered of healthy neonates. There were 118 incidents of CD under general anesthesia and 82 of VD chosen for the study. Methods: Data was obtained using an 'Introductory Information Form' which was prepared as suggested by related literature, and by using the '(LATCH) Breastfeeding Charting System.' Results: According to the LATCH Scoring System, the average score for the first breastfeeding was 6.27 and 8.81 for the third in CD mothers and 7.46 for the first breastfeeding and 9.70 for the third in VD mothers. Statistically meaningful differences were defined between the first (t = 10.48; p &lt; .001), second (t = 7.82; p &lt; .001), and third (t = 7.12; p &lt; .001) breastfeeding sessions in both CD and VD mothers. Conclusions: It was found that the pattern of delivery affects breastfeeding and that CD mothers need more support and help as compared to VD mothers. CD mothers were seen to need more support, particularly in positioning their babies for breastfeeding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The aetiology of mild motor disability (MMD) is a complex issue and as yet is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of perinatal risk factors in a cohort of 10-year-old boys and girls with (n = 362) and without (n = 1,193) MMD. Among the males with MMD there was a higher prevalence of postpartum haemorrhage, caesarean section, low birth weight and stressful first year of life. Among the females with MMD, there was a higher prevalence of essential hypertension, anaemia and threatened pre-term. Multivariable logistic regression revealed gender (male), anaemia, threatened pre-term birth (if female) and hypertension (if female) weakly explained MMD at 10 years. These results underscore the importance of considering gender differences in order to better understand the multiple influences on motor development.

        <ab>Background: External cephalic version (ECV) reduces the rate of elective cesarean sections as a result of breech presentation. Several studies have shown that not all eligible women undergo an ECV attempt. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of ECV in the Netherlands and to explain variation in implementation rates with hospital characteristics and individual factors. Methods: We invited 40 hospitals to participate in this retrospective cohort study. We reviewed hospital charts for all singleton breech deliveries from 36 weeks' gestation and onwards between January 2008 and December 2009. We documented whether an ECV attempt was performed, reasons for not performing an attempt, mode of delivery, and hospital characteristics. Results: We included 4,770 women from 36 hospitals. ECV was performed in 2,443 women (62.2% of eligible women, range 8.2–83.6% in different hospitals). Implementation rates were higher in teaching hospitals, hospitals with special office hours for ECV, larger obstetric units, and hospitals located in larger cities. Suboptimal implementation was mainly caused by health care providers who did not offer ECV. Conclusion: ECV implementation rates vary widely among hospitals. Suboptimal implementation is mostly caused by the care provider not offering the treatment and secondly due to women not opting for the offered attempt. A prerequisite for designing a proper implementation strategy is a detailed understanding of the exact reasons for not offering and not opting for ECV.

        <ab>Background: Around 2 percent of women who give birth in Australia each year do so in a birth center. New South Wales, Australia's largest state, accounts for almost half of these births. Previous studies have highlighted the need for better quality data on maternal morbidity and mortality, to fully evaluate the safety of birth center care. Aims: This study aimed to examine maternal morbidity related to birth center care for women in New South Wales. Methods: A retrospective cohort study with matched‐pairs was conducted using linked health data for New South Wales. Maternal outcomes were compared for women who intended to give birth in a birth center, matched with women who intended to give birth in the co‐located hospital labor ward. Results: Rates of maternal outcomes, including postpartum hemorrhage, retained placenta, and postpartum infection, were significantly lower in the birth center group, after controlling for demographic and institutional factors. Interventions such as cesarean section and episiotomy were also significantly lower in these women, and the rate of breastfeeding at discharge was higher. There existed no difference in length of stay, admission to ICU, or maternal mortality. Conclusions: Birth centers are a safe option for low‐risk women; however, further research is required for some rare maternal outcomes.

        <ab>Aims and objectives: To evaluate the correlation between maternal fatigue and uterine contraction pattern at the beginning of the active phase of labour. Background: Fatigue is one of the most common complaints in pregnant women that often continues until delivery. Maternal fatigue prolongs the labour process and increases the rate of cesarian section. Studies on the pattern of uterine contractions have shown that the length of the fall time is longer in prolonged labours than in normal deliveries. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: This study was conducted on 100 primiparous women who were referred to Ommolbanin Hospital (Mashhad, Iran) in 2011. Maternal fatigue was assessed at the beginning of the active phase of labour. Then, the pattern of uterine contractions was monitored for 30 minutes by an external tocodynamometer. The F/R ratio was determined by measuring the time for a contraction to return to its baseline from its peak and the time for a contraction to rise to its peak. The data were analysed by chi-square and ANOVA tests. Results: The results showed that there was a significant relationship between maternal fatigue and uterine contraction pattern. The F/R ratio was increased with increase in fatigue severity. Conclusions: Fatigue causes changes in the pattern of uterine contractions. The return time of a contraction from its peak to its baseline (fall) is increased with increase in fatigue severity. Relevance to clinical practice: Offering strategies to prevent tiredness and reduce the related fatigue complications. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal socioeconomic position and a persistent low Apgar score (a score of &lt; 7 at 1 and 5 min following birth). Methods: The research is based on a population cohort study of 183,637 males born in Sweden between 1973 and 1976. Data from the Medical Birth Register were linked to Population and Housing Censuses. Results: There was evidence that mothers working in non-manual (Odds ratio (OR) 0.83 (0.72-0.97)) and self-employed (OR 0.64 (0.44-0.93)) occupations were less likely to have an infant with a low Apgar score, compared to manual workers. There was evidence that the risk of a low Apgar score decreased as the mother's level of education increased, if the infant was born by instrumental (OR 0.86 (0.74-0.99)) or caesarean section (OR 0.80 (0.68-0.93)) delivery, but not by unassisted vaginal delivery (OR 1.01 (0.92-1.10)). Conclusion: There was a lower risk of poor birth condition in male infants born to more educated and non-manual/self-employed mothers. These differences may contribute to our understanding of socioeconomic differences in infant health and development although the results may not be applicable due to changes over the last 30 years.

        <ab>This cross‐sectional correlational study examined post‐partum depression and its relationship with demographic, maternal, and infant health problems in urban Jordanian women. Participants (n = 315) were selected from five maternal child healthcare centers and one major hospital in Amman, Jordan. Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 was used to measure post‐partum depression within 12 weeks of birth. A number of socio‐demographic and health problems were examined for an association with post‐partum depression. Results showed that 25% of post‐partum women suffered moderate to severe depression and 50% of the sample had mild depression. None of the socio‐demographic variables (age, education, employment, income) were significantly related to post‐partum depression; however, two obstetric/infant variables (mode of birth and breastfeeding), were significantly associated with post‐partum depression. There was a significant association between post‐partum depression and 15 health problems of obstetric, gynecologic (i.e. episiotomy pain, infection), and general health conditions (i.e. fatigue, headache). Nurses and midwives need to emphasize post‐partum depression screening, follow‐up, and proper management of maternal and infant health factors predisposing to post‐partum depression rather than merely focusing on women's inherent demographic factors.

        <ab>The objective of this study was to compare deliveries in women with HIV at Homerton University Hospital with those in the general antenatal hospital population. The study was a retrospective case-note review of deliveries from 1994 to 2004 at an Inner City London Hospital, UK (Homerton University Hospital). In all, 113 deliveries were studied in 98 women with HIV. Compared with the general antenatal population, women with HIV were more likely to be from African backgrounds, describe inadequate housing and be without the support of a partner or family; 79.8% of deliveries in women with HIV were by caesarean section in comparison with 22.4% in the overall hospital population. A majority of women with HIV received antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy. Intercurrent medical and antenatal complications were uncommon and in a majority the postpartum periods were uncomplicated. A significantly higher proportion of women with HIV infection described a previous history of depression than in the general hospital population. There were two instances of vertical transmission of HIV. In conclusion, our observations suggest that with appropriate monitoring and management strategies, successful pregnancy outcomes can be achieved in a complex HIV-positive patient population.

        <ab>Forty women (mean age 29.2 yrs) who had given birth for the 1st time following full term-pregnancy participated in a study concerning distress in response to 1 of 4 obstetric procedures: spontaneous vaginal delivery; induced vaginal delivery; instrumental vaginal delivery; or, emergency caesarean section. During their 6th wk post-delivery, they completed questionnaires and supplied biographical data. Those who had undergone instrumental delivery (as assisted by episiotomy) described the birth of their child as significantly more distressing, themselves as being more at risk of injury and dissatisfied with the efficacy of pain relief during labor than women in the other 3 obstetric groups. By comparison, those who had an emergency caesarean section retrospectively reported little psychological distress or perceived risk of serious injury and significantly greater satisfaction with pain relief. Thus, it would appear that the well-being of women who experience an instrumental delivery is in need of additional support. Further prospective research is needed with a larger study population to confirm or otherwise the observations made in this initial investigation.

        <ab>Objectives: To verify the effect of vibroacoustic stimulation on biophysical profile score, with a prospective randomised study. Study design: All women with singleton pregnancy, gestational age ≥ 30 weeks, intact membranes and biophysical profile score ≤ 8/10 entered the study, after giving written consent, and were randomised to two groups. In group A, a 3-s stimulus with an artificial larynx was applied; if biophysical profile remained abnormal for 30 min, a second stimulus was applied and it was assessed again. In group B, the observation time was extended for 60 min to match the time periods of group A. Pregnancies were managed by final test score and patients delivering more than 24 h apart from last examination were disregarded from the study. Outcome criteria were intrauterine deaths, caesarean sections for fetal distress, Apgar score &lt; 7 at 5 min postpartum, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Our null hypothesis was that application of vibroacoustic stimulation does not alter test's statistical parameters. Results: 1349 patients were randomised in group A and 1484 in group B (2833 in total). When comparing group A to B, application of vibroacoustic stimulation significantly decreased the number of positive tests (4.74% vs. 6.67%, p &lt; 0.05) and increased the prevalence of outcome criteria in this subgroup (positive likelihood ratio: 24.1 95% CI: 11.12-52.46 vs. 7.52 95% CI: 4.93-11.46), without altering perinatal outcome. Furthermore, specificity, positive predictive value and test accuracy were significantly improved, as well as negative predictive value for intrauterine death. Conclusion: Vibroacoustic stimulation improves the efficiency of biophysical profile score by decreasing false positive tests and improving test accuracy and should be considered as a means of a more thorough fetal evaluation when fetal compromise is suspected.

        <ab>Introduction: This study sought to examine the differences in pregnancy outcomes with a focus on gestational weight gain for women attending group prenatal care compared to standard individual prenatal care. Methods: A matched case‐control study was conducted including 65 women who chose group care and 130 women who chose standard individual care. Women were matched based on prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) category, eligibility for midwifery care, and age within 5 years. Results: Women choosing group prenatal care and women choosing standard individual care had similar gestational weight gain, birth weight, gestational age at birth, and mode of birth. Women choosing group prenatal care did have a significantly higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum (odds ratio [OR], 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81‐9.15; P &lt; .001) than women choosing individual care. Discussion: Group prenatal care participation resulted in equivalent gestational weight gain as well as pregnancy outcomes as compared to standard individual care. Breastfeeding rates were improved for women choosing group prenatal care. Randomized controlled trials are needed in order to eliminate selection bias.

        <ab>Aims: To describe the frequency of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in a French population of randomly selected women during their third trimester of pregnancy and its evolution up to 3 months after delivery and to identify potential factors associated with the improvement of RLS after delivery. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Results: 186 pregnant women living in a French town were included. 32% of women were affected by RLS during the third trimester of their pregnancy. Multiple pregnancies and iron intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with RLS during the third trimester. RLS disappeared after delivery among 64.8% of the women, and by less than 2 weeks after delivery in half of them. This improvement after delivery was not associated with the number of previous pregnancies, the RLS severity and iron intake during pregnancy, peridural anaesthesia, caesarean section, delivery complications, new-born weight, breastfeeding, dopaminergic agent intake after delivery, and with the absence of RLS before pregnancy. Conclusions: RLS affects one third of pregnant women during their third trimester and usually improves after delivery. Although there is no allowed treatment, most of the time only counselling and iron status assessment should be provided. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Importance: Planned cesarean delivery comprises a significant proportion of births globally, with combined rates of planned and unscheduled cesarean delivery in a number of regions approaching 50%. Observational studies have shown that offspring born by cesarean delivery are at increased risk of ill health in childhood, but these studies have been unable to adjust for some key confounding variables. Additionally, risk of death beyond the neonatal period has not yet been reported for offspring born by planned cesarean delivery. Objective: To investigate the relationship between planned cesarean delivery and offspring health problems or death in childhood. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based data-linkage study of 321 287 term singleton first-born offspring born in Scotland, United Kingdom, between 1993 and 2007, with follow-up until February 2015. Exposures: Offspring born by planned cesarean delivery in a first pregnancy were compared with offspring born by unscheduled cesarean delivery and with offspring delivered vaginally. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was asthma requiring hospital admission; secondary outcomes were salbutamol inhaler prescription at age 5 years, obesity at age 5 years, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, cancer, and death. Results: Compared with offspring born by unscheduled cesarean delivery (n = 56 015 [17.4%]), those born by planned cesarean delivery (12 355 [3.8%]) were at no significantly different risk of asthma requiring hospital admission, salbutamol inhaler prescription at age 5 years, obesity at age 5 years, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or death but were at increased risk of type 1 diabetes (0.66% vs 0.44%; difference, 0.22% [95% CI, 0.13%-0.31%]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05-1.75]). In comparison with children born vaginally (n = 252 917 [78.7%]), offspring born by planned cesarean delivery were at increased risk of asthma requiring hospital admission (3.73% vs 3.41%; difference, 0.32% [95% CI, 0.21%-0.42%]; adjusted HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.11-1.34]), salbutamol inhaler prescription at age 5 years (10.34% vs 9.62%; difference, 0.72% [95% CI, 0.36%-1.07%]; adjusted HR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.01-1.26]), and death (0.40% vs 0.32%; difference, 0.08% [95% CI, 0.02%-1.00%]; adjusted HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.05-1.90]), whereas there were no significant differences in risk of obesity at age 5 years, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, or cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: Among offspring of women with first births in Scotland between 1993 and 2007, planned cesarean delivery compared with vaginal delivery (but not compared with unscheduled cesarean delivery) was associated with a small absolute increased risk of asthma requiring hospital admission, salbutamol inhaler prescription at age 5 years, and all-cause death by age 21 years. Further investigation is needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: In the United States, the number of planned home vaginal births after cesarean (VBACs) has increased. This study describes the maternal and neonatal outcomes for women who planned a VBAC at home with midwives who were contributing data to the Midwives Alliance of North America Statistics Project 2.0 cohort during the years 2004–2009. Method: Two subsamples were created from the parent cohort: 12,092 multiparous women without a prior cesarean and 1,052 women with a prior cesarean. Descriptive statistics were calculated for maternal and neonatal outcomes for both groups. Sensitivity analyses comparing women with a prior vaginal birth and those who were at the lowest risk with various subgroups in the parent cohort were also conducted. Results: Women with a prior cesarean had a VBAC rate of 87 percent, although transfer rates were higher compared with women without a prior cesarean (18% vs 7%, p &lt; 0.001). The most common indication for transfer was failure to progress. Women with a prior cesarean had higher proportions of blood loss, maternal postpartum infections, uterine rupture, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions than those without a prior cesarean. Five neonatal deaths (4.75/1,000) occurred in the prior cesarean group compared with 1.24/1,000 in multiparas without a history of cesarean (p = 0.015). Conclusion: Although there is a high likelihood of a vaginal birth at home, women planning a home VBAC should be counseled regarding maternal transfer rates and potential for increased risk to the newborn, particularly if uterine rupture occurs in the home setting.

        <ab>Objective: To assess the outcomes and costs of hospital admission during the latent versus active phase of labor. Latent labor hospital admission has been consistently associated with elevated maternal risk for increased interventions, including epidural anesthesia and cesarean delivery, longer hospital stay, and higher utilization of hospital resources. Methods: A cost-effectiveness model was built to simulate a theoretic cohort of 3.2 million term, medically low-risk women either being admitted in latent labor (&lt; 4 cm dilation) or delaying admission until active labor (≥ 4 cm dilation). Outcomes included epidural use, mode of delivery, stillbirth, maternal death, and costs of care. All probability, cost, and utility estimates were derived from the literature, and total quality-adjusted life years were calculated. Sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo simulation were used to investigate the robustness of model assumptions. Results: Delaying admission until active labor would result in 672,000 fewer epidurals, 67,232 fewer cesarean deliveries, and 9.6 fewer maternal deaths in our theoretic cohort as compared to admission during latent labor. Additionally, delaying admission results in a cost savings of $694 million annually in the United States. Sensitivity analyses indicated the model was robust within a wide range of probabilities and costs. Monte Carlo simulation found that delayed admission was the optimal strategy in 76.79 percent of trials. Conclusion: Delaying admission until active labor is a dominant strategy, resulting in both better outcomes and lower costs. Issues related to clinical translation of these findings are explored.

        <ab>To identify maternal, care provider, and institutional-level risk factors for early term (37–38 weeks) elective repeat cesarean delivery in a population-based cohort. Retrospective cohort study of women in the British Columbia (BC) Perinatal Data Registry, BC, Canada, 2008–2011, with an elective repeat cesarean delivery at term. Absolute percent differences (risk differences) in early term delivery rates were calculated according to maternal characteristics, type of care provider, calendar time (day of the week, time of year), and annual institutional obstetrical volume. Of the 7,687 elective repeat cesareans at term in BC, 55 % occurred before 39 + 0 weeks. Early term delivery was significantly more common with multiple previous cesareans [8.2 percentage points (95 % CI 5.5, 10.9) for 2 previous cesareans, 11.3 (95 % CI 5.1, 17.4) for 3 or more previous cesareans], obesity [6.7 percentage points (95 % CI 1.6, 11.7)], and a hospital obstetrical volume &lt; 2,500 deliveries per year. Type of care provider and calendar time were not significant risk factors for early term delivery. Early term elective repeat cesarean was common across a wide range of maternal, care provider, and institutional characteristics, suggesting that most obstetrical care settings would benefit from quality-improvement programs to reduce elective repeat cesarean deliveries before 39 weeks. A better understanding of the risks and benefits of early term delivery among obese women and women with multiple previous cesareans is needed given the higher rates of early term delivery observed in these women.

        <ab>Purpose: This study evaluated obstetric and neonatal outcome in a community-based cohort of women with active epilepsy (WWAE) compared with the general pregnant population receiving modern obstetric care. Methods: We reviewed the total population who gave birth between January 1989 and October 2000 at Kuopio University Hospital. Obstetric, demographic, and epilepsy data were collected prospectively from 179 singleton pregnancies of women with epilepsy and from 24,778 singleton pregnancies of unaffected controls. The obstetric data from the pregnancy register was supplemented with detailed neurologic data retrieved from the medical records. The data retrieved were comprehensive because of a follow-up strategy according to a predecided protocol. Results: During pregnancy, the seizure frequency was unchanged, or the change was for the better in the majority (83%) of the patients. We found no significant differences between WWAE and controls in the incidence of preeclampsia, preterm labor, or in the rates of caesarean sections, perinatal mortality, or low birth weight. However, the rate of small-for-gestationalage infants was significantly higher, and the head circumference was significantly smaller in WWAE. Apgar score at 1 min was lower in children of WWAE, and the need for care in the neonatal ward and neonatal intensive care were increased as compared with controls. The frequency of major malformations was 4.8% (-0.6-10.2%; 95% confidence interval) in the 127 children of WWAE. Conclusions: Pregnancy course is uncomplicated and neonatal outcome is good in the majority of cases when a predecided protocol is used for the follow-up of WWAE in antenatal and neurologic care. Long-term follow-up of the neurologic and cognitive development of the children of WWAE is still needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Used twin data to test the hypothesis that the effect of genetic factors on child problem behavior varies as a function of exposure to pregnancy and birth complications (PBCs). 760 twin pairs aged 6-17 yrs from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey were included. Multilevel regression analysis was used to assess the effects of several PBCs (mode of delivery, fetal presentation, artificial induction of ovulation, and lower birth weight) collected around the time of birth. Using structural equation modelling, ACE models assuming additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C) and unique environmental (E) influences, were compared. Results show a main independent effect of lower birth weight, corrected for gestational age (small for gestational age [SGA]), on child problem behavior. There was an interaction between genetic influence and SGA, in that being smaller for gestational age resulted in less influence of additive genetic factors on individual differences in problem behavior. Results are suggestive of negative gene-birth weight interaction. Children who are SGA are less sensitive to the genetic effects, and those with high genetic vulnerability are less sensitive to the effects of being SGA in bringing about post-natal mental health effects.

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate pregnant women's intentions for opting for caesarean section (CS), their experiences regarding previous births and their expectations for subsequent delivery. Our objectives were to identify medical and psychological predictors pertaining to the decision for CS on demand. Design: The cross-sectional survey was conducted at two study centres over a three-month period including German speaking women at any time of pregnancy and consisted of an anonymous structured questionnaire. Logistic regression was computed to investigate the predictive value of medical variables, birth experience and birth anxiety on the demand for CS. Results: Nineteen of 201 participants preferred to deliver by CS on demand and 15 felt uncertain about their decision. How the preceding delivery had been experienced was significantly better in the vaginal delivery (VD)-group (women not considering CS on demand) than in the CS-group (good experience in 81.7% and 52.0% respectively, p = 0.007). A negative previous birth experience and a preceding CS were predictors for the wish to deliver by CS. Conclusions: As negative birth experience predicts the wish for a CS, specific supportive care during first pregnancy could play a pivotal role in making this decision.

        <ab>Background: Previous studies show contradictory results about the impact of induced labor on the cesarean delivery rate and few studies have investigated the risk of vacuum extraction subsequent to induced labor. The aims of the present study were to describe the rate of induced labor in Sweden from 1999 to 2012, and to assess the risk of unplanned cesarean delivery and vacuum extraction after induced labor in relation to medical complications and length of gestation. Methods: A register-based cohort study was conducted, including 1,078,536 women with spontaneous or induced onset of labor who gave birth by noninstrumental vaginal delivery, unplanned cesarean delivery, or vacuum extraction in gestational week 37 + 0 to 41 + 6. Logistic regression was used to study the association between induced labor and instrumental delivery. Results: The rate of induced labor increased from 7.7 to 12.9 percent among primiparous and from 7.5 to 11.8 percent among multiparous women. Induced labor was associated with 2–3 times greater risk of unplanned cesarean delivery among all women, except multiparas in gestational week 37–38, and with a 20–50 percent higher risk of vacuum extraction after the adjustment for confounding factors. Among women without a recognized medical complication, induced labor was associated with a threefold increased risk of cesarean delivery in gestational week 39–41 and a 40 percent increase in gestational week 37–38 compared with women with spontaneous onset of labor. Conclusions: The proportion of induced labors increased substantially during the 14-year study period and was associated with an increased risk of both cesarean delivery and vacuum extraction, even in women without a documented medical complication. The increased risk of instrumental delivery should be taken into account when counseling about the risks and benefits of induced labor.

        <ab>Since China adopted its reform and opening-up policy, the state of society has changed dramatically. Correspondingly, Chinese college students' scores of the Experiences in Close Relationships scale are expected to have changed from 2003 to 2015. A cross-temporal meta-analysis found that Chinese college students' scores of the attachment anxiety subscale increased by 0.2 standard deviations in the past 13years. With a turning point in 2009, the scores of the attachment avoidance subscale increased by 0.58 standard deviations from 2003 to 2009 and decreased by 0.57 standard deviations from 2009 to 2015. Five social indicators including divorce rate, C-section rate, household size, Consumer Price Index, and Gini coefficient showed significant correlation with attachment anxiety. The results from a second meta-analysis showed that there was no gender difference or cohort effect in gender difference in Chinese college students' adult attachment scores. Finally, the explanations and implications of these changes and the insignificant gender difference are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Previous research has demonstrated that negative childbirth expectations adversely influence perinatal outcomes. The current research builds on this with Italian mothers-to-be. Objective: The present study (1) explored the influence of cognitive and emotional variables on labour and delivery outcomes and (2) examined how individual characteristics, couple adjustment, and medical factors influence the childbirth experience. Method: 121 Italian primiparous women participated in a prospective longitudinal study where participants completed a set of questionnaires between the 32nd and 37th week of pregnancy and again 30–40 days post-delivery. Results: Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that women with negative childbirth expectations were three times more likely to experience an emergency C-section or an instrumental vaginal delivery. Furthermore, childbirth expectations predicted subjective birth experience. This relationship between expectations and delivery type and the subjective childbirth experience was weak while other variables (such as anxiety, depression, couple adjustment) did not significantly influence delivery type or the subjective childbirth experience. Conclusions: The weak relationship between childbirth expectations and perinatal outcomes renders it necessary to question the nature of the relationship found in previous research, especially considering inconsistencies of the literature on the subject. The current research makes it clear that further research is needed to understand better the relationship between expectations and perinatal outcomes in order to better improve the well-being of mothers-to-be during labour and delivery.

        <ab>Objectives: In response to the dearth of consumer health information for patients with gastrointestinal cancers, this study examined the informational needs of these patients to build a plan for future resource development. Although studies have examined informational needs of some such cancers, no published literature has investigated the comprehensive informational needs across all sites of gastrointestinal cancer. Methods: A cross‐sectional needs assessment comprising a self‐administered questionnaire was conducted at an ambulatory gastrointestinal oncology clinic in Toronto, Canada. Patient informational needs were measured, including importance of information, amount desired and preferred mode of delivery. Informational needs were grouped into six domains: medical, practical, physical, emotional, social and spiritual. Results: Eighty‐two surveys were analysed. The majority of the respondents were male (53.8%), over the age of 50 (77.8%), and born outside of Canada (51.9%). While many did not speak English as a child (46.3%), and do not speak English at home (22.2%), nearly all indicated comfort with receiving health information in English (97.5%). The majority of respondents were college educated (79.3%) and married (73%). Multiple cancer types were reported; the most common being colorectal (39%), followed by pancreatic (12%) and cancers of the gallbladder or bile duct (12%). Overall, respondents placed highest importance on medical information (P &lt; 0.001). Preferred education modalities were pamphlets, websites and one‐on‐one discussions with health‐care professionals. Conclusions: This study highlights the principal informational needs of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, along with preferred modality for information delivery. This information will guide the development of educational resources for future patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: There are geographic variations in fetal outcomes of adolescent pregnancies because of socioeconomic differences between regions and countries. The aim of our study was to determine adverse fetal outcomes associated with adolescent pregnancies in Cameroon. Methods: A cross-sectional study to compare the outcomes of 268 singleton, adolescent pregnancies with 832 controls, delivered in four referral hospitals in Yaounde (Cameroon), between November 2004 and April 2005. Results: The adverse fetal outcomes related to adolescent pregnancies were low birth weight (&lt;2,500 g) (odds ratios [OR], 1.71; confidence interval [CI], 1.15-2.50), premature babies (&lt;37 weeks) (OR, 1.77; CI, 1.24-2.52) and early neonatal death (OR, 2.18; CI, 1.04-4.48). The rates of stillbirth and intrauterine growth retardation were not significantly higher among adolescents. Adverse maternal outcome associated with adolescent pregnancies were eclampsia (OR, 3.18; CI, 1.21-8.32), preeclampsia (OR, 1.99; CI, 1.24-3.15), perineal tear (OR, 1.45; CI, 1.06- 1.99) and episiotomy (OR, 1.82; CI, 1.20-2.73). Caesarean delivery, instrumental delivery and premature rupture of membranes were not significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy. Maternal factors associated with adverse fetal outcome in adolescents were maternal age, number of prenatal visits &lt;4, and the state of being unemployed. Conclusion: Adolescent pregnancies are associated with both adverse fetal and maternal outcomes in Cameroon. Improving compliance with prenatal care could significantly reduce the frequency of adverse fetal outcomes in adolescent populations in Cameroon.

        <ab>Introduction: This paper describes an approach to maternal mortality reduction in Pakistan that uses UN emergency obstetric care (EmOC) process indicators to examine if public health care centres in Pakistan's Punjab province comply with minimum recommendations for basic and comprehensive services. Methods: In a cross sectional study in September 2003, through random sampling at area and health-facility levels from 30% of districts in Punjab province (n = 11/34 districts), all public health facilities providing EmOC were included (n = 120). Facility data were used for analysis. Results: No district in Punjab met the minimum standards laid down by the UN for providing EmOC services. The number of facilities providing basic and comprehensive EmOC services fell far short of recommended levels. Only 4.7% of women with complications attended hospitals. Caesarean section was carried out in only 0.4% of births. The case fatality rate was hard to accurately calculate due to poor record keeping and data quality. Conclusion: The study may be taken as a baseline for developing and improving the standards of services in Punjab province. It is vital to upgrade existing basic EmOC facilities and to ensure that staff skills be improved, facilities be better equipped in critical areas, and record keeping be improved. Hence to reduce maternal mortality, facilities for EmOC must exist, be accessible, offer quality services, and be utilized by patients with complications.

        <ab>Prospective studies on the predictors of postpartum depression (PPD) in Latin America are scarce, which is a matter of importance, since the significance of PPD risk factors may vary according to the level of development of a country, the types of measurement and the time periods assessed. This study identifies the prenatal predictors for PPD (diagnostic interview) and postpartum depressive symptoms (PPDS) (self-report scale) in Mexican mothers at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Two hundred and ten women were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-I), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and various risk factor scales. Univariate logistic regressions showed that social support, marital satisfaction, life events, a history of psychopathology, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, the traditional female role, previous miscarriages/termination of pregnancy and unplanned/unwanted pregnancy were significant predictors for both PPD and PPDS at both assessment times in the postpartum. Education, age, marital status, income, occupation, parity, C-section and resilience were significant for only one of the measurements and/or at just one assessment time. General findings replicate a high- and low-income country observed psychosocial risk profile and confirm a sociodemographic and obstetric profile of vulnerability that is more prevalent in resource-constrained countries. PPD constitutes a high burden for new mothers, particularly for those living in low-middle-income countries who face social disadvantages (such as low educational attainment and income).

        <ab>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD:MIM#143465) is the most common neurobehavioral syndrome of childhood. Recent reports indicate a prevalence rate varying from 4% to 12% of all school-aged children. At present, criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD is codified in the DSM-IV. Our patient came to our paediatric neurology outpatient service since his parents noticed learning disabilities, behavioural problems, attention deficit and impaired language development. The boy was born pre-term by caesarean section at 32 weeks of gestation as first child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. The Terman-Merrill revised test revealed predominantly language impairment; his Global Developmental Merrill Quotient (GDQ, normal range=0.70-1.3), defined as developmental age divided by chronological age, was at the lowest level of the normal range (GDQ=0.70), whereas his verbal item quotient revealed severe impairment (GDQ=0.18). MRI showed a bilateral opercula and perisylvian sulcus enlargement associated with polymicrogyria, predominantly in the left hemisphere. Chromosome analysis, performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes using GTG banding technique, revealed a constitutional mosaicism for trisomy 18 (74%). To our knowledge, no previous reports describing ADHD and polymicrogyria in trisomy 18 mosaicism are present in literature. Our patient does not present any skeletal, cardiologic, endocrinologic or gastroenterologic disease. In order to better define the relationship between some neurological clinical pictures and the trisomy 18 mosaicism, further studies in a cohort of patients are needed.

        <ab>Introduction: The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of postpartum sexual activity and functioning in a diverse population of women using the Sexual Health Outcomes in Women Questionnaire (SHOW-Q). Methods: This was a prospective study of 160 postpartum women assessing relationships between demographic factors,mode of birth, depression, breastfeeding, and sexual activity and function. Questionnaires were administered over the telephone 8 to 10 weeks postpartum and in person 6 to 8 months postpartum. Primary outcomes were sexual activity at 8 to 10 weeks postpartum and global and subscale SHOW-Q scores at 6 to 8 months postpartum; the primary predictor was mode of birth. Associations were assessed using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: Seventy-five percent of this population (n = 140 at 8-10 weeks, n = 129 at 6-8 months) gave birth vaginally, and 60.7% resumed sexual activity by 8 to 10 weeks postpartum. Only multiparity was associated with increased odds of having resumed sexual activity by 8 to 10 weeks postpartum (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.44; P = .03), whereas older age was associated with decreased odds (aOR, 0.92; P = .02) of having resumed sexual activity. Women who were depressed (effect estimate, −13.3; P = .01), older (−1.1, P = .01), or exclusively breastfeeding (−16.5, P &lt;.001) had significantly poorer sexual satisfaction, whereas multiparous women reported better sexual satisfaction (11.1, P =.03). A significant relationship between mode of birth and SHOW-Q scores did not emerge, although we did observe a trend toward lower SHOW-Q scores among women who underwent cesarean compared with those giving birth vaginally. Discussion: Multiparity and younger age predict early resumption of sexual activity, whereas depression and breastfeeding are associated with poorer postpartum sexual functioning. The relationship between mode of birth and resumed sexual activity or postpartum sexual function remains uncertain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The predictive factors of secondary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) are little known. Our principal objective was to determine if immediate PPH is a risk factor for severe secondary PPH. We also sought to identify other factors associated with severe secondary PPH. Methods: Our historical cohort study included all women who gave birth (≥ 22 weeks) in our level III hospital from 2004 through 2013. The hospital discharge database enabled us to identify all women readmitted during the 42‐day postpartum period or who underwent a surgical, medical, or interventional radiology procedure during their immediate postpartum hospitalization. We then examined all medical records to identify the cases involving severe secondary PPH. We studied the known risk factors of secondary PPH and assessed other potential ones: maternal age, multiple pregnancy, induction of labor, cesarean birth, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Results: The study included 63 women with a severe secondary PPH and 25,696 women without a secondary PPH. Immediate PPH (aOR 2.7 [95% CI 1.3–5.6]) and maternal age ≥ 35 years (aOR 2.0 [95% CI 1.1–3.7]) were the only factors associated with severe secondary PPH. Discussion: This cohort study confirms that immediate PPH is a risk factor for severe secondary PPH and reports for the first time an association between secondary PPH and advanced maternal age. It is likely that risk factors for immediate PPH are also risk factors for severe secondary PPH and thus that immediate PPH may be an intermediate factor between its own known risk factors and secondary PPH.

        <ab>Background: Effective early detection of infants with permanent hearing impairment requires parental compliance with various stages of a screening protocol. However, many infants who failed initial screening tests are often not presented for follow-up evaluation, thus compromising prospects for early detection and intervention. This study set out to determine maternal and infant factors associated with loss to follow-up in a hospital-based universal hearing screening programme in a low-income country. Methods: A cross-sectional study in which babies in a tertiary maternity hospital were enrolled into a two-stage hearing screening programme with transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions followed by automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) for all transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions referrals before hospital discharge. Diagnostic evaluation was scheduled for AABR referrals on outpatient basis. Correlates of non-compliance were determined through multivariable logistic regression analyses of relevant maternal and infant factors. Results: Some 1330 babies participated in the first-stage screening and of 551 scheduled for AABR; 56 (10.2%) did not complete. Some 37 (84.1%) of the 44 AABR referrals did not complete the diagnostic evaluation. There were no significant differences between the profile of those who did not complete either the second-stage screening or diagnostic evaluation and those who completed across virtually all socio-demographic factors except that Christian mothers were significantly more likely not to complete the second-stage screening than diagnostic evaluation compared with their Muslim counterparts (odds ratio: 3.01; 95% confidence intervals: 1.17–7.87). The only independent predictors of non-compliance with pre-discharge screening were delivery by spontaneous vertex (odds ratio: 2.76; 95% confidence intervals: 1.47–5.19) and admission into special care baby unit (odds ratio: 5.62; 95% confidence intervals: 2.92–10.84) while no factor was predictive of non-compliance with diagnostic evaluation. Conclusions: Mode of delivery or having high-risk baby influences compliance before hospital discharge while factors other than maternal or infant socio-demographic/medical profile such as unfavourable cultural beliefs and stigma may be key determinants of follow-up compliance after discharge.

        <ab>Tubal sterilization is the most common contraceptive method used by Brazilian HIV-positive women. This cross sectional study describes the main reasons why HIV-positive women decide to be sterilized and identifies factors associated with choosing sterilization in HIV-positive women in Ceará, northeast Brazil. Data from 229 non-sterilized women, 80 women sterilized before HIV diagnosis and 48 women sterilized after diagnosis were analysed. Of the women sterilized after HIV diagnosis, 96% had the procedure done in the postpartum, during a caesarean section. No desire for more children was the most common appointed reason to be sterilized (39.6%), followed by medical recommendation because of HIV (31.3%). Seventy-nine women (28.5%) had a child after HIV diagnosis. Of those, 46 (58.2%) were sterilized in the postpartum. Factors associated with sterilization for HIV-positive women were: having a child after diagnosis (AOR: 120.9; 95%CI: 27.8-525.4) and having at least three children (AOR: 2.8; 95%CI: 1.1-7.1). It is recommended that non-coercive counselling should be provided so that HIV-positive women can make informed decisions on their reproductive options.

        <ab>Background: This study compares outcomes at a hospital‐linked, physician‐led, birthing center to a traditional hospital labor and delivery service. Methods: Using de‐identified electronic medical records, a retrospective cohort design was employed to evaluate 32,174 singleton births during 1998–2005. Results: Compared with hospital service, birth care center delivery was associated with a lower rate of cesarean sections (adjusted Relative Risk = 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.59–0.91; p &lt; 0.001) without an increased rate of operative vaginal delivery (adjusted Relative Risk = 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.97–1.13; p = 0.25) and a higher initiation of breastfeeding (adjusted Relative Risk = 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.25–1.30; p ≤ 0.001). A maternal length of stay greater than 72 hours occurred less frequently in the birth care center (adjusted Relative Risk = 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.55–0.66; p &lt; 0.001). Comparing only women without major obstetrical risk factors, the differences in outcomes were reduced but not eliminated. Adverse maternal and infant outcomes were not increased at the birth care center. Conclusion: A hospital‐linked, physician‐led, birth care center has the potential to lower rates of cesarean sections without increasing rates of operative vaginal delivery or other adverse maternal and infant outcomes.

        <ab>We hypothesized that, concurrent with increased expression in dorsal horn, increased secretion would elevate the cystatin C content in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during active pain states. Alterations were assessed by immunoassay and by surface enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry with either reverse phase or immobilized anti-cystatin C antibody surfaces using CSF from ten age-matched obstetrical patients at term. Five control subjects were scheduled for an elective caesarian section and were not in pain. Another five subjects were in labor for 8.9 ± 1 h and were in severe pain as assessed with a visual analog scale and the McGill short form questionnaire. The level of cystatin C as measured by immunoassay in the non-pain patients was 2.77 ± 0.75 μg/ml and in the pain patients 5.36 ± 0.92 μg/ml (P &lt; 0.02). The elevation occurred without significant change in total CSF protein or β-endorphin content. The cystatin C increase also was detectable by SELDI with either raw CSF or after antibody capture. These data are consistent with our previous animal study and the idea that persistent pain induces the synthesis and release of cystatin C in dorsal spinal cord, the surplus of which overflows into the CSF.

        <ab>Objective: The goal was to evaluate the neurobehavioral outcomes of term, small-for-gestational age (SGA) newborns with normal placental function. Methods: A cohort of consecutive term SGA newborns with normal prenatal umbilical artery Doppler ultrasound findings was created and compared with a group of term infants with size appropriate for gestational age, who were sampled from our general neonatal population. Neonatal behavior was evaluated at corrected age of 40 ± 1 weeks with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. The effect of the study group on each Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale area was adjusted, through multivariate analysis of covariance, for smoking during pregnancy, maternal BMI, socioeconomic level, onset of labor, mode of delivery, use of epidural anesthetic medication, gestational age at delivery, postnatal age (in days) at evaluation, and gender. Results: A total of 202 newborns (102 SGA and 100 appropriate for gestational age) were included. All of the neurobehavioral areas studied were poorer in the SGA group, with significance for attention, habituation, motor, social-interactive, and regulation of state. The average mean differences in scores between the study groups were 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.38–1. 14) for attention, 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.13–1.14) for habituation, 0.52 (95% confidence interval: 0.31–0.74) for motor, 0.95 (95% confidence interval: 0.54–1.37) for social-interactive, and 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.23–1.13) for regulation of state. These differences remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. Conclusion: Term SGA newborns with no signs of placental insufficiency had poorer neurobehavioral competencies, which suggests delayed neurologic maturation.

        <ab>To test the hypothesis that advanced maternal age (AMA) of 35 years and above is associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we performed a population-based retrospective study using data from the 2000 National Health Survey in Oman. The last pregnancy outcomes of mothers aged ≥35 years were compared with adult mothers aged 20–34 years using bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Significantly increased risks of spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, prolonged labor, and cesarean section delivery have been observed for advanced maternal age. Our findings may contribute to cross-cultural understanding of the risks associated with AMA and will facilitate evidence-based counseling of older expectant mothers.

        <ab>Background: Previous cross-sectional studies have highlighted a number of obstetric variables that may be associated with the development of broadly defined puerperal (post-partum) psychosis. These include: (a) primiparity, (b) pregnancy complications, (c) delivery complications, (d) Caesarean section, (e) female baby and (f) shorter gestation period. Aims: To examine these risk factors in women with well-characterised bipolar affective puerperal psychosis. Method: A sample of 129 women with bipolar affective puerperal psychosis were investigated using a design that takes advantage of within-subject comparisons of affected and unaffected deliveries. Results: Two of the variables studied were independently associated with an episode of puerperal psychosis: primiparity (odds ratio=3.76, P&lt;0.001) and delivery complications (odds ratio=2.68, P=0.022). Conclusions: This study provides further evidence of the association between primiparity and puerperal psychosis and suggests that complications during delivery may be associated with a severe post-partum episode.

        <ab>Determined which obstetric complications are more common in probands with schizophrenia than matched controls. 296 probands (aged 22–26 yrs) with an inpatient diagnosis of schizophrenia who had been born in Scotland in 1971–74, and a further 156 (aged 18–22 yrs) born in 1975–78, were closely matched with controls and the incidence of obstetric complications in the 2 compared using obstetric data recorded in a set format shortly after birth. Not a single complication of pregnancy or delivery was significantly more common in the probands with schizophrenia than the controls in the 1971–74 birth cohort and only emergency caesarean section and labor lasting over 12 hrs were significantly more common in the schizophrenia probands in the 1975–78 cohort. This research extends that conducted by R. E. Kendell et al (see record [rid]1996-04676-004[/rid]), which showed a highly significant excess of complications of both pregnancy and delivery in the probands with schizophrenia. The evidence from the current study demonstrates that the association between schizophrenia and a raised incidence of obstetric complications is weaker than has recently been assumed.

        <ab>Presents a case study of healthy 37-year-old high school teacher. She was nulliparous and did not want to have children during her 12-year marriage because of fear of childbirth (FOC). During this time her husband and social environment encouraged her about giving birth, but she was not persuaded until she finally decided to have a child when her husband stated that her doctor and social environment would overcome her fear. During pregnancy no complications developed. The mother was regularly monitored by a gynecologist, and fetal ultrasounds were normal. At the same time, she stated that she was happy to be pregnant and to be a parent. She preferred cesarean section and delivered a 3,400-g male infant at Week 384/7 of gestation without any complication. Social support appears not to be sufficient on this topic, and programs to emphasize the importance of breastfeeding for health of both mother and child during pregnancy might have prevented rejection of breastfeeding. In the literature there is no study found on the breastfeeding rates for children born to women with FOC. In this case it is thought that the refusal of breastfeeding may be related to FOC. It is believed that prospective studies are required to explain this topic and the relationships involved. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Importance: Extremely preterm infants contribute disproportionately to neonatal morbidity and mortality. Objective: To review 20-year trends in maternal/neonatal care, complications, and mortality among extremely preterm infants born at Neonatal Research Network centers. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective registry of 34 636 infants, 22 to 28 weeks’ gestation, birthweight of 401 to 1500 g, and born at 26 network centers between 1993 and 2012. Exposures: Extremely preterm birth. Main Outcomes and Measures: Maternal/neonatal care, morbidities, and survival. Major morbidities, reported for infants who survived more than 12 hours, were severe necrotizing enterocolitis, infection, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe intracranial hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, and/or severe retinopathy of prematurity. Regression models assessed yearly changes and were adjusted for study center, race/ethnicity, gestational age, birth weight for gestational age, and sex. Results: Use of antenatal corticosteroids increased from 1993 to 2012 (24%[348 of 1431 infants]) to 87%(1674 of 1919 infants]; P &lt; .001), as did cesarean delivery (44%[625 of 1431 births] to 64%[1227 of 1921]; P &lt; .001). Delivery room intubation decreased from80%(1144 of 1433 infants) in 1993 to 65%(1253 of 1922) in 2012 (P &lt; .001). After increasing in the 1990s, postnatal steroid use declined to 8%(141 of 1757 infants) in 2004 (P &lt; .001), with no significant change thereafter. Although most infantswere ventilated, continuous positive airway pressure without ventilation increased from 7%(120 of 1666 infants) in 2002 to 11% (190 of 1756 infants) in 2012 (P &lt; .001). Despite no improvement from 1993 to 2004, rates of late-onset sepsis declined between 2005 and 2012 for infants of each gestational age (median, 26weeks [37% {109 of 296} to 27%{85 of 320}]; adjusted relative risk [RR],0.93 [95%CI,0.92-0.94]). Rates of other morbidities declined, but bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased between 2009 and 2012 for infants at 26 to 27 weeks’ gestation (26 weeks, 50%[130 of 258] to 55%[164 of 297]; P &lt; .001). Survival increased between 2009 and 2012 for infants at 23 weeks’ gestation (27%[41 of 152] to 33%[50 of 150]; adjusted RR, 1.09 [95%CI, 1.05-1.14]) and 24weeks (63%[156 of 248] to 65%[174 of 269]; adjusted RR, 1.05 [95%CI, 1.03-1.07]), with smaller relative increases for infants at 25 and 27weeks’ gestation, and no change for infants at 22, 26, and 28 weeks’ gestation. Survival without major morbidity increased approximately 2% per year for infants at 25 to 28 weeks’ gestation, with no change for infants at 22 to 24 weeks’ gestation. Conclusions and Relevance: Among extremely preterm infants born at US academic centers over the last 20 years, changes in maternal and infant care practices and modest reductions in several morbidities were observed, although bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased. Survival increased most markedly for infants born at 23 and 24 weeks’ gestation and survival without major morbidity increased for infants aged 25 to 28 weeks. These findings may be valuable in counseling families and developing novel interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Aim: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) represents one of the gravest complications in premature infants. The suggested role of intestinal microbiota in the development of NEC needs to be elucidated. Methods: This prospective single-centre case–control study applied barcoded pyrosequencing to map the bacterial composition of faecal samples from extremely preterm infants. Ten patients were diagnosed with NEC and matched to healthy controls with regard to sex, gestational age and mode of delivery prior to analysis of the samples. Results: Enterococcus, Bacillales and Enterobacteriaceae dominated the flora. Although not statistically significant, a high relative abundance of Bacillales and Enterobacteriaceae was detected at early time points in patients developing NEC, while healthy controls had a microbiota more dominated by Enterococcus. A low diversity of intestinal microbial flora was found without any differences between NEC patients and controls. In 16 healthy controls, Firmicutes (Enterococcus and Bacillales) dominated the faecal flora during the first weeks after birth and were then succeeded by Enterobacteriaceae. Conclusion: No significant differences in the composition of intestinal microbiota of patients developing NEC were detected; however, some findings need to be scrutinized in subsequent studies.

        <ab>Importance: Based on older analyses, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that cesarean delivery rates should not exceed 10 to 15 per 100 live births to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes. Objectives: To estimate the contemporary relationship between national levels of cesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional, ecological study estimating annual cesarean delivery rates from data collected during 2005 to 2012 for all 194 WHO member states. The year of analysis was 2012. Cesarean delivery rates were available for 54 countries for 2012. For the 118 countries for which 2012 data were not available, the 2012 cesarean delivery rate was imputed from other years. For the 22 countries for which no cesarean rate data were available, the rate was imputed from total health expenditure per capita, fertility rate, life expectancy, percent of urban population, and geographic region. Exposures: Cesarean delivery rate. Main Outcomes and Measures: The relationship between population-level cesarean delivery rate and maternal mortality ratios (maternal death from pregnancy related causes during pregnancy or up to 42 days postpartum per 100 000 live births) or neonatal mortality rates (neonatal mortality before age 28 days per 1000 live births). Results: The estimated number of cesarean deliveries in 2012 was 22.9 million (95% CI, 22.5 million to 23.2 million). At a country-level, cesarean delivery rate estimates up to 19.1 per 100 live births (95% CI, 16.3 to 21.9) and 19.4 per 100 live births (95% CI, 18.6 to 20.3) were inversely correlated with maternal mortality ratio (adjusted slope coefficient, −10.1; 95% CI, −16.8 to −3.4; P = .003) and neonatal mortality rate (adjusted slope coefficient, −0.8; 95% CI, −1.1 to −0.5; P &lt; .001), respectively (adjusted for total health expenditure per capita, population, percent of urban population, fertility rate, and region). Higher cesarean delivery rates were not correlated with maternal or neonatal mortality at a country level. A sensitivity analysis including only 76 countries with the highest-quality cesarean delivery rate information had a similar result: cesarean delivery rates greater than 6.9 to 20.1 per 100 live births were inversely correlated with the maternal mortality ratio (slope coefficient, −21.3; 95% CI, −32.2 to −10.5, P &lt; .001). Cesarean delivery rates of 12.6 to 24.0 per 100 live births were inversely correlated with neonatal mortality (slope coefficient, −1.4; 95% CI, −2.3 to −0.4; P = .004). Conclusions and Relevance: National cesarean delivery rates of up to approximately 19 per 100 live births were associated with lower maternal or neonatal mortality among WHO member states. Previously recommended national target rates for cesarean deliveries may be too low. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To describe the clinical outcomes and sustainability factors of a long-standing midwifery led caseload model of rural maternity care. Design: Retrospective clinical audit from 1998 to 2011 and autoethnographic narrative of the midwifery program told by the longest serving midwives under three key themes relating to sustainable practice. Setting: Regional Health Service with annual birth rate of 500. Maternity care is provided by either public antenatal clinic/GP shared care or midwife-led care. Participants: Women attending a rural caseload midwifery group practice between the period 1998–2011 and midwives working in the same group practice during that period. Main outcome measures: Antenatal attendance, maternal mortality, infant morbidity and mortality, mode of birth, known midwife at birth, initiation of breastfeeding. Results: There were 1674 births between 1998 and 2011. Clinical outcomes for women and infants closely reflected national maternity indicator data. The group practice midwives attribute sustainability of the program to the enjoyment of flexibility in their working environment, to establishing trust amongst themselves, the women they care for, and with the obstetricians, GPs and health service executives. The rigorous application of midwifery principles including robust clinical governance have been hallmarks of success. Conclusion: This caseload midwifery group practice is a safe, satisfying and sustainable model of maternity care in a rural setting. Clinical outcomes are similar to standard care. Success can be attributed to strong leadership across all levels of policy, health service management and, most importantly, the rural midwives providing the service.

Puertas, Pierre A. Beitinger, Isabelle Arnulf, Renata L. Riha, Maria Tormášiová, Jana Slonková, Sona Nevšímalová and Karel Šonka (Journal of Sleep Research, 2013[Oct], Vol 22[5], 496-512). In the original article, there were two errors in the affiliations. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-33304-004[/rid]). In a retrospective cohort study undertaken in 12 European countries, 249 female narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (n = 216) and without cataplexy (n = 33) completed a self‐administrated questionnaire regarding pregnancy and childbirth. The cohort was divided further into patients whose symptoms of narcolepsy started before or during pregnancy (308 pregnancies) and those in whom the first symptoms of narcolepsy appeared after delivery (106 pregnancies). Patients with narcolepsy during pregnancy were older during their first pregnancy (P &lt; 0.001) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) prior to pregnancy (P &lt; 0.01). Weight gain during pregnancy was higher in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (P &lt; 0.01). More patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy during pregnancy had impaired glucose metabolism and anaemia. Three patients experienced cataplexy during delivery. The rate of caesarean sections was higher in the narcolepsy–cataplexy group compared to the narcolepsy group (P &lt; 0.05). The mean birth weight and gestational age of neonates were within the normal range and did not differ across groups. Neonatal care was affected adversely by symptoms of narcolepsy in 60.1% of those with narcolepsy during pregnancy. This study reports more obstetric complications in patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy during pregnancy; however, these were not severe. This group also had a higher BMI and higher incidence of impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Caesarian section was conducted more frequently in narcolepsy–cataplexy patients, despite cataplexy being a rare event during delivery. Furthermore, symptoms of narcolepsy may render care of the infant more difficult. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The objective was to determine the relationship between the risk of assisted delivery in women aged under 20 years and place of treatment, deprivation and age. A cross sectional survey utilising routinely collected hospitals admissions data was conducted. Teenagers whose delivery resulted in a hospital admission in the period April 1st 1994 to March 31st 1997 in the Trent Health Region of England were the subjects. Variables collected included type of delivery, age at delivery and place of treatment. The main outcomes measured were the factors associated with increased risk of assisted delivery. There was variation in rates of instrumental delivery between hospitals, with two having a significantly increased risk of assisted delivery, suggesting that place of treatment may be a factor in the risk of teenage patients experiencing an assisted delivery. There was also a large amount of variation in terms of the risk of experiencing a forceps or vacuum extraction compared to caesarean section. The risk of assisted delivery varied between hospitals, suggesting that this factor is important in terms of a young women's risk of an assisted delivery.

        <ab>Background: Although C-section is a highly effective procedure, literature abounds with evidence of overuse and particularly misuse, in lower-value indications such as low-risk deliveries. This study aims to quantify utilization of C-section in low-risk cases, mapping out areas showing excess-usage in each country and to estimate excess-expenditure as a proxy of the opportunity cost borne by healthcare systems. Methods: Observational, ecologic study on deliveries in 913 sub-national administrative areas of five European countries (Denmark, England, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain) from 2002 to 2009. The study includes a cross-section analysis with 2009 data and a time-trend analysis for the whole period. Main endpoints: age-standardized utilization rates of C-section in low-risk pregnancies and deliveries per 100 deliveries. Secondary endpoints: Estimated excess-cases per geographical unit of analysis in two scenarios of minimized utilization. Results: C-section is widely used in all examined countries (ranging from 19% of Slovenian deliveries to 33% of deliveries in Portugal). With the exception of Portugal, there are no systematic variations in intensity of use across areas in the same country. Cross-country comparison of lower-value C-section leaves Denmark with 10% and Portugal with 2%, the highest and lowest. Such behaviour was stable over the period of analysis. Within each country, the scattered geographical patterns of use intensity speak for local drivers playing a major role within the national trend. Conclusion: The analysis conducted suggests plenty of room for enhancing value in obstetric care and equity in women’s access to such within the countries studied. The analysis of geographical variations in lower-value care can constitute a powerful screening tool. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: The research was conducted to determine the correlation between breastfeeding success in the early postpartum period and the perception of self-efficacy in breastfeeding and breast problems in late postpartum. Methods: This analytic and cross-sectional research was carried out at Aydın Obstetrics and Gynecology and Children's Diseases Hospital. Three hundred twenty-seven primipara mothers who had delivered a single baby of healthy term at 37 or more gestational weeks with no previous experience with breastfeeding and who agreed to cooperate participated in the research. Results: The mothers' mean gestational week of delivery was 39.25 ± 1.10 weeks, and it was found that 56.0% had delivered by cesarean section and 57.0% had started to breastfeed immediately after the birth. The mothers' LATCH mean score was 6.55 ± 0.86; their postnatal breastfeeding self-efficacy mean score was found to be 59.10 ± 7.21. Mothers who had high success in breastfeeding at early postpartum were found to experience fewer problems with their breasts (Z = −2.65, p &lt; 0.05), gave birth by vaginal delivery (Z = −2.88, p &lt; 0.05), and had not received anesthesia during the delivery (Z = −2.52, p &lt; 0.05). In the correlation analysis, it was seen that mothers with high success in breastfeeding also had high self-efficacy scores (r = 0.210, p = 0.003). Conclusion: The results of the research indicated that breastfeeding success in the early postpartum period reduced breast problems and increased the perception of breastfeeding self-efficacy in the late postpartum period.

        <ab>Background: Complications during the perinatal period have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia and autism. However, similar studies on bipolar disorder (BPD) have been limited and the findings are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to examine the association between perinatal risk factors and BPD. Methods: This nested case-control study, based on the Finnish Prenatal Study of Bipolar Disorders (FIPS-B), identified 724 cases and 1419 matched controls from population based registers. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the associations between perinatal factors and BPD adjusting for potential confounding due to maternal age, psychiatric history and educational level, place of birth, number of previous births and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Results: Children delivered by planned cesarean section had a 2.5-fold increased risk of BPD (95% CI: 1.32–4.78, P &lt;0.01). No association was seen between other examined perinatal risk factors and BPD. Limitations: The limitations of this study include: the restriction in the sample to treated cases of BPD in the population, and usage of hospital based clinical diagnosis for case ascertainment. In addition, in spite of the large sample size, there was low power to detect associations for certain exposures including the lowest birth weight category and pre-term birth. Conclusions: Birth by planned cesarean section was associated with risk of BPD, but most other perinatal risk factors examined in this study were not associated with BPD. Larger studies with greater statistical power to detect less common exposures and studies utilizing prospective biomarker-based exposures are necessary in the future.

        <ab>Importance: In an effort to improve the quality of care, several obstetric-specific quality measures are now monitored and publicly reported. The extent to which these measures are associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity is not known. Objective: To examine whether 2 Joint Commission obstetric quality indicators are associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based observational study using linked New York City discharge and birth certificate data sets from 2010. All delivery hospitalizations were identified and 2 perinatal quality measures were calculated (elective, nonmedically indicated deliveries at 37 or more weeks of gestation and before 39 weeks of gestation; cesarean delivery performed in low-risk mothers). Published algorithms were used to identify severe maternal morbidity (delivery associated with a life-threatening complication or performance of a lifesaving procedure) and morbidity in term newborns without anomalies (births associated with complications such as birth trauma, hypoxia, and prolonged length of stay). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to examine the association between maternal morbidity, neonatal morbidity, and hospital-level quality measures while risk-adjusting for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Individual- and hospital-level maternal and neonatal morbidity. Results: Severe maternal morbidity occurred among 2372 of 115 742 deliveries (2.4%), and neonatal morbidity occurred among 8057 of 103 416 term newborns without anomalies (7.8%). Rates for elective deliveries performed before 39 weeks of gestation ranged from 15.5 to 41.9 per 100 deliveries among 41 hospitals. There were 11.7 to 39.3 cesarean deliveries per 100 deliveries performed in low-risk mothers. Maternal morbidity ranged from 0.9 to 5.7 mothers with complications per 100 deliveries and neonatal morbidity from 3.1 to 21.3 neonates with complications per 100 births. The maternal quality indicators elective delivery before 39 weeks of gestation and cesarean delivery performed in low-risk mothers were not associated with severe maternal complications (risk ratio [RR], 1.00 [95%CI, 0.98-1.02] and RR, 0.99 [95%CI, 0.96-1.01], respectively) or neonatal morbidity (RR, 0.99 [95%CI, 0.97-1.01] and RR, 1.01 [95%CI, 0.99-1.03], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Rates for the quality indicators elective delivery before 39 weeks of gestation and cesarean delivery performed in low-risk mothers varied widely in New York City hospitals, as did rates of maternal and neonatal complications. However, there were no correlations between the quality indicator rates and maternal and neonatal morbidity. Current quality indicators may not be sufficiently comprehensive for guiding quality improvement in obstetric care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Depression and anxiety are important mood changes in childbearing women. However, changes in depression and anxiety over time in women who undergo an elective cesarean section (CS) have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to characterize the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and patterns of co-occurrence, and examined the associated predictors of depression and anxiety courses. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of childbearing women (N = 139) who underwent a CS was conducted. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were respectively assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Anxiety Inventory, in the third trimester and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Group-based modeling identified three distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms: group 1 (low, 30.9%), group 2 (mild, 41.7%), and group 3 (high, 27.3%). Four group trajectories of anxiety symptoms were identified: group 1 (low, 19.4%), group 2 (mild, 44.6%), group 3 (high, 28.8%), and group 4 (very high, 7.2%). Mild symptoms of both depression and anxiety were the most common joint trajectory. Depression trajectories were significantly related to anxiety trajectories (p &lt; 0.001). Predictors of the joint trajectory included the pre-pregnant body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1∼6.3) and a poor sleep score (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4∼7.3) in the third trimester. Conclusions: Distinctive trajectories and co-occurrence patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to continuous assessment of psychological well-being among women who undergo an elective CS.

        <ab>Background: To offer vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) in a hospital setting is recommended in international guidelines, but offering VBAC in out‐of‐hospital settings is considered controversial. This study describes neonatal and maternal outcomes in mothers who started labor in German out‐of‐hospital settings. Method: In a retrospective analysis of German out‐of‐hospital data from 2005 to 2011, included were 24,545 parae II with a singleton pregnancy in a cephalic presentation at term (1,927 with a prior cesarean and 22,618 with a prior vaginal birth). Result: The overall VBAC rate was 77.8 percent. The intrapartum transfer rate to hospital was 38.3 percent (prior cesarean) versus 4.6 percent (prior vaginal) (p &lt; 0.05), and the 10‐minute Apgar &lt; 7 rate was 0.6 versus 0.2 percent (p &lt; 0.05), and the nonemergency intrapartum transfer rate was 91.5 versus 85.0 percent (p &lt; 0.05). Prolonged first stage of labor was the most common reason for intrapartum transfer in both groups. The leading reason for postpartum transfer was retained placenta. Discussion: There was a high rate of successful VBAC in this study. The high nonemergency transfer rate for women with VBAC might mean that midwives are more cautious when attending women with a prior cesarean in out‐of‐hospital settings. Further studies are necessary to evaluate which women are suitable for VBAC in out‐of‐hospital settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The optimal mode of breech birth remains controversial. In Finland, a trial of vaginal delivery is possible if strict selection criteria are met. As clinical practice in managing vaginal breech birth differs from that in normal delivery, the birth experience may also be different. This cohort study compares the childbirth experience between term breech and vertex deliveries. Methods: Intended vaginal term breech births from 2008 to October 2012 were included, and for every breech delivery, a vertex control was selected. The proportions of deliveries ending in a cesarean section and of mothers who had given birth vaginally before were equal in both groups. Three hundred eight mothers were sent the childbirth experience questionnaire and 170 returned it. Results: The birth experience does not differ between breech and vertex births, except for aspects with respect to the choice of birthing position. Indications of an even more positive experience were observed in the breech group, with the exception of the choice of analgesia, but these were not statistically significant. Primiparity, emergency cesarean section, infant birth trauma and prolonged hospital stay were identified as risk factors for a negative birth experience. Conclusion: The birth experience of vaginal breech birth seems to be at least as positive as the vaginal vertex birth experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background and Objectives: This study identified the determinants of the introduction of prelacteal feeds in the Maldives. Subjects and Methods: A cohort of 458 mothers was recruited from antenatal clinics at two major hospitals in Male´, the Maldives. The mothers were followed up after birth at 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. The child’s birth, the type of infant delivery, the time breastfeeding was initiated, gender of the infants, types of prelacteal feeds, and feeding method were recorded. Results: After birth, 4.1% of infants received infant formula from the hospitals, whereas 10.6% and 7.4% of them received honey and dates, respectively, as prelacteal ritual feeds. Factors associated with introduction of ritual feeds as prelacteal feeds included the infant being a boy (p = 0.05; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–2.98), attitude toward prelacteal feeds (p = 0.01; AOR = 2.87; 95% CI, 1.48–5.58), and maternal employment (p = 0.01; AOR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.9). Higher maternal age was inversely associated with introduction of ritual feeds as a prelacteal feed (p = 0.05; AOR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9). Introduction of infant formula as the prelacteal feed was positively associated with birth by cesarean section (p = 0.01; AOR = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.6–13.3) and inversely associated with maternal mother’s feeding method being breastfeeding (p = 0.05; AOR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04–0.6). Prelacteal feeding was associated with cessation of breastfeeding before 6 months (p = 0.01; AOR 6.0; 95% CI, 1.64–21.80). Conclusions: Health professionals need to distinguish between religious and cultural practices in order to develop appropriate health education programs to reduce the unnecessary use of early additional feeds.

        <ab>Objective: This study compared breastfeeding initiation following repeat cesarean delivery, successful vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), and unsuccessful trial of labor. Subjects and Methods: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of Ohio births (2006–2007) with a previous cesarean delivery. The primary outcomes were breastfeeding initiation rates among women with a previous cesarean delivery. Breastfeeding initiation rates were compared among three different delivery types: repeat cesarean delivery, successful VBAC, and unsuccessful trial of labor. Sociodemographic factors, medical risk factors, and pregnancy-related risk factors were also compared to assess influence on breastfeeding initiation rates. Results: Women delivered by successful VBAC were 47% more likely to initiate breastfeeding than women delivered by scheduled repeat cesarean (adjusted relative risk 1.47; 95% confidence interval 1.35, 1.60). Women who ultimately delivered by cesarean section with unsuccessful trial of labor were also more likely to breastfeed than women with a scheduled repeat cesarean section (61% vs. 58.7%, respectively) (adjusted relative risk 1.17; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.33). Conclusions: Patients who undergo a scheduled repeat cesarean delivery are less likely to initiate breastfeeding. Women who attempt and succeed in achieving vaginal birth after a previous cesarean section are more likely to breastfeed than are women who deliver by repeat cesarean section. Also, those women who ultimately deliver by cesarean section after an unsuccessful trial of labor were also more likely to breastfeed than those women with a scheduled repeat cesarean section. This suggests there are influences on patient choice for delivery that also may influence the patient’s decision to breastfeed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Although management of twin deliveries has been a topic of discussion for decades, a consensus on how to deliver twins is lacking. The objective of this study was to examine short-term neonatal outcome of the second twin delivered by cesarean section after vaginal delivery of the first-born twin (combined delivery) and to identify predictors of combined delivery. Methods: This study was a 3-year, population-based, retrospective cohort investigation of 1,254 twin births in Denmark. The twin births were divided into three groups: vaginal deliveries, planned cesarean deliveries, and combined deliveries. Data were extracted from medical records, a fetal medicine software program (Astraia), and the National Birth Registry. Short-term poor neonatal outcome was measured as a 5-minute Apgar score ≤ 7, umbilical cord pH ≤ 7.10, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit for more than 3 days. Results: Vertex-nonvertex fetal presentations were more prevalent in combined deliveries than vaginal deliveries (OR 4.4, 2.5–7.8). Nonvertex second twins born by combined delivery had a higher risk of Apgar score ≤ 7 and umbilical cord pH ≤ 7.10 compared with vaginal delivery, unadjusted OR 6.2 (2.1–18), and unadjusted OR 3.9 (1.6–9.5). Prenatal ultrasound scans were evaluated in combined deliveries, of which 48 percent were vertex-vertex at the last ultrasound scan in pregnancy (mean gestational age 34 + 0) and 37 percent were vertex-vertex at birth. Conclusions: Vertex-nonvertex presenting twins have an increased risk of combined delivery. Combined deliveries are associated with increased neonatal morbidity for the second twin.

        <ab>Background: Midwives providing care as lead maternity caregivers in New Zealand provide continuity of care to women who may give birth in a variety of settings, including home, primary units, and secondary and tertiary level hospitals. The purpose of this study was to compare mode of birth and intrapartum intervention rates for low‐risk women planning to give birth in these settings under the care of midwives. Methods: Data for a cohort of low‐risk women giving birth in 2006 and 2007 were extracted from the Midwifery Maternity Provider Organisation database. Mode of birth, intrapartum interventions, and neonatal outcomes were compared with results adjusted for age, parity, ethnicity, and smoking. Results: Women planning to give birth in secondary and tertiary hospitals had a higher risk of cesarean section, assisted modes of birth, and intrapartum interventions than similar women planning to give birth at home and in primary units. The risk of emergency cesarean section for women planning to give birth in a tertiary unit was 4.62 (95% CI: 3.66–5.84) times that of a woman planning to give birth in a primary unit. Newborns of women planning to give birth in secondary and tertiary hospitals also had a higher risk of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (RR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.05–1.87; RR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.31–2.42) than women planning to give birth in a primary unit. Conclusions: Planned place of birth has a significant influence on mode of birth and rates of intrapartum intervention in childbirth.

        <ab>Background: Black and Latina women in the United States are known to undergo cesarean delivery at a higher rate than other women. We sought to explore the role of medical indications for cesarean delivery as a potential explanation for these differences. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 11,034 primiparas delivering at term at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1990 and 2008. We used multivariable analyses to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in risks of, and indications for, cesarean delivery. Results: The overall rate of cesarean delivery in our cohort was 21.9 percent. Black and Latina women were at significantly higher odds of undergoing cesarean delivery than white women (adjusted odds ratio or AOR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.83, and 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.43, respectively). Black women were at significantly higher odds of undergoing cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal heart tracings than white women (AOR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.55, 3.09), and black women (AOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.21, 1.98), Latina women (AOR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.85), and Asian women (AOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.22, 1.85) were at significantly higher odds of undergoing cesarean delivery for failure to progress. Black, Latina, and Asian women were at significantly lower odds of undergoing cesarean delivery for malpresentation than white women (AOR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.89, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.98, and 0.55; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.76, respectively). Conclusions: Racial and ethnic differences exist in specific indications for cesarean delivery among primiparas. Clarifying the possible reasons for increased cesareans for nonreassuring fetal heart tracing in black women, in particular, may help to decrease excess cesarean deliveries in this racial and ethnic group.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate women's expectations regarding cesarean and to assess the subjective experience of birth of these women. Because the birth experience is a multidimensional phenomenon, qualitative as well as quantitative approaches were used to investigate women's expectations and experiences with cesarean. Design: Descriptive cohort study. Setting: The Division of Obstetrics and Feto‐Maternal Medicine of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of an Austrian medical university. Participants: Forty‐eight women with a planned cesarean birth. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with the 48 women before (36th week of gestation) the planned cesarean and shortly thereafter. Data were analyzed by means of a qualitative content analysis. Anxiety, depression, and psychological distress were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Results: More than three fourths (81.3%) of the women were satisfied with the cesarean. Nevertheless, 83.3% of the women expressed anxiety about cesarean, including fears about the health of the infant, the epidural anesthesia, and possible complications. Before the cesarean, only one half of the women (54.2%) felt that they had been sufficiently informed about the planned cesarean, and only 25% had detailed knowledge about the specific course of events of the cesarean. Quantitative assessment showed low depression levels and overall psychological distress before and after the cesarean. State anxiety levels were high before the cesarean and moderate afterwards. Conclusion: Although the overall satisfaction and psychological tolerability of a planned cesarean is high, improvement is possible by providing more detailed information to the prospective mothers and by specifically addressing prevalent anxieties.

        <ab>Background: Research examining long-term health outcomes for women after childbirth has been limited. The objective of this study was to investigate the natural history of common morbidities in the 18 months after the birth of a first child, and to explore the hypothesis that women who have a cesarean section for a first birth experience less overall morbidity in the postnatal period. Methods: A prospective nulliparous pregnancy cohort study was conducted of 1,507 women recruited in early pregnancy from six public hospitals in Melbourne, Australia (mean gestation 15 weeks). Follow-up questionnaires at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum included standardized measures of urinary and fecal incontinence, and a symptom checklist asking about common physical health problems. Results: At 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum, no statistically significant differences were found in the proportion of women reporting three or more health problems by method of birth. Compared with women who had a spontaneous vaginal birth, women who had a cesarean section were more likely to report extreme tiredness at 6 months postpartum (adjusted OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.07–1.82) and at 12 months postpartum (adjusted OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.05–1.85), and were more likely to report back pain at 6 months postpartum (adjusted OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.06–1.77) and at 12 months postpartum (adjusted OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.06–1.87). Women who had a cesarean section were less likely to report urinary incontinence at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum, respectively (adjusted OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.19–0.36; adjusted OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.25–0.52; adjusted OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.33–0.68). For all other physical health problems the pattern of morbidity did not differ between cesarean section and spontaneous vaginal birth. Conclusions: Physical health problems commonly persist or recur throughout the first 18 months postpartum, with potential long-term consequences for women’s health. Cesarean section does not result in women experiencing less overall morbidity in the postpartum period compared with women who have a spontaneous vaginal birth.

        <ab>Background: According to the World Health Organization, mental health disorders are the leading causes of disease burden in women from 15 to 44 years. These conditions in pregnant women may affect the offspring. Aim: To analyze the relation between depression and anxiety of pregnant women and neonatal outcomes including gestational age and birthweight. Study design: Observational cohort study. Subjects: 2002 women recruited before the 20th gestational week. Outcome measures: Gestational age at delivery in completed weeks of amenorrhea and preterm delivery defined as birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation. Spontaneous preterm birth (PB) defined as either spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Medically indicated preterm delivery defined as delivery that begins by induction or cesarean section. Birthweight as a continuous variable and centiles of the customized fetal weight norms for the French population. Results: From the 1719 women included in the study, 7.9% (n = 135) were classified as 'anxious', 11.8% (n = 203) as 'depressed', 13.2% (n = 227) as 'depressed and anxious'. After adjusting for potential confounders, depression combined with anxiety during pregnancy increased the risk of spontaneous PB (Odds Ratio: 2.46 [1.22–4.94]), but did not influence medically indicated PB nor birthweight. Conclusion: In this study, comorbidity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was the worst condition during pregnancy. Further studies are needed to investigate depression and anxiety together to improve the comprehension of the biological modifications involved.

        <ab>Background: Symptoms of both depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are prevalent among first-time mothers following birth. However, the direction of the association between the two types of symptoms is unclear. Methods: Ninety six first-time mothers giving birth via vaginal delivery (N = 38), emergency C-Section (N = 27) and planned C-Section (N = 21) were assessed for depression and PTSD twice: Six weeks post-partum and six-weeks later. Results: Cross-lagged Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analyses revealed a prospective effect of depressive symptoms on PTSD symptoms. No moderating factors were identified. Limitations: A relatively modest sample size and only two assessment waves. Conclusions: An early detection and intervention with symptoms of post-partum depression might also prevent the development of PTSD symptoms.

        <ab>Despite American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines suggesting that non-urgent planned deliveries be scheduled at/after 39 weeks; elective delivery before 39 weeks occurs often in the United States. The objective of this study is to estimate the elective delivery rate between 360/7 and 386/7 weeks gestation and compare NICU admission rates between elective and non-elective deliveries. We conducted a retrospective cohort (n = 1,577) study. Charts were reviewed for all singleton deliveries (2006–2007) between 360/7 and 386/7 weeks gestation taking place at one hospital in NYS to determine delivery status. We computed adjusted relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for elective delivery in relation to NICU admission using robust Poisson regression. 32.8% of all births were elective: 20.7% of vaginal and 55.7% of cesarean births. Elective delivery increased with increasing gestational age. After controlling for potential confounders, infants born via a vaginal elective delivery (RR = 1.40, CI: 1.00, 1.94), an elective cesarean (RR = 2.05, CI: 1.53, 2.76), or a non-elective cesarean (RR = 2.00, CI: 1.50, 2.66) are at significantly increased risk of NICU admission compared to infants born via a non-elective vaginal delivery. Elective delivery before 39 weeks is common and increases the risk of infant NICU admission. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To describe women's experiences with the perception of, evaluation of, and response to postpartum pain after cesarean delivery through the sensory, affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions of pain. The secondary aim of this research was to differentiate pain described with nociceptive and neuropathic pain descriptors. Design: Longitudinal, concurrent mixed methods design. Setting: Large, university‐based, midwestern medical center. Participants: Convenience sample of 30 low‐risk women scheduled for cesarean deliveries. Methods: The PAINReportIt, a computerized version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, was administered in person to participants at two visits: between 24 and 48 hours postcesarean delivery and at 6 weeks postpartum. Descriptive statistics, t tests, and χ² tests were calculated from these data and pain descriptor selections were compared with established nociceptive and neuropathic pain descriptor lists. Results: Pain was reported in all dimensions at both visits. The abdomen was most frequently selected for pain location; mean intensity was 2.75/10 at the first visit, 1.1/10 at the 6‐week visit. Pain in the sensory and cognitive dimensions decreased significantly between visits. Affective dimension pain decreased, but the difference was not significant. Participants reported activities that increased and decreased pain in the behavioral dimension. Pain descriptors indicative of nociceptive (e.g., tender, sore) and neuropathic (e.g. aching) pain were selected at both visits. Conclusion: Postpartum pain after cesarean delivery is multidimensional and has been described with words indicative of nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Nurses should complete a thorough and comprehensive pain assessment throughout the postpartum for patients experiencing cesarean deliveries.

        <ab>Objectives: To analyze the Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength (PFMS) of pregnant women with one or more vaginal or cesarean deliveries; to compare the PFMS of these with pregnant women with the PFMS of primiparous women. Methods: Cross-sectional study with women up to 12 weeks pregnant, performed in Itapecerica da Serra, Sao Paulo state, from December 2012 to May 2013. The sample consisted of 110 pregnant women with one or more vaginal deliveries or cesarean sections and 110 primigravidae. The PFMS was evaluated by perineometry (Peritron (TM)) and vaginal digital palpation (modified Oxford scale). Results: The average PFMS in pregnant women with a history of vaginal delivery or cesarean section was 33.4 (SD = 21.2) cmH₂O. From the Oxford scale, 75.4% of the pregnant women with previous vaginal or cesarean deliveries presented grade ≤ 2, and 5.5% grade ≥ 4; among the primiparae, 39.9% presented grade ≤ 2, and 50.9% grade ≥ 4, with a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.001). From the perineometry, there was no statistically significant difference between the PFMS and age, type of delivery, parity, body mass index, and genitourinary tract symptoms, however, there was a statistically significant difference between the pregnant women with and without a history of episiotomy (p = 0.04). In the palpation, none of the variables showed a statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Pregnancy and childbirth can reduce the PFMS.

        <ab>Purpose: We examined the association between rural residence and birth outcomes in older mothers, the effect of parity on this association, and the trend in adverse birth outcomes in relation to the distance to the nearest hospital with cesarean‐section capacity. Methods: A population‐based retrospective cohort study, including all singleton births to 35+ year‐old women in British Columbia (Canada), 1999‐2003. We compared birth outcomes in rural versus urban areas, and between 3 distance categories to a hospital (&lt;50, 50‐150, &gt;150 km). Outcomes included labor induction, cesarean section, stillbirth, perinatal death, preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks), small‐for‐gestational‐age, large‐for‐gestational‐age, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. We used multivariate regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Findings: Among the 29,698 subjects, 11.5% lived in rural areas; 5% lived within 50‐150 km; and 1.1% lived &gt;150 km from a hospital. Rural women were at lower risk of primary and repeat cesarean section (OR = 0.9, CI: 0.9‐1.0; OR = 0.7, CI: 0.6‐0.9) and small‐for‐gestational‐age (OR = 0.8, CI: 0.7‐0.9) births; they were at increased risk for perinatal death (OR = 1.5, CI: 1.1‐2.1) and large‐for‐gestational‐age (OR = 1.1, CI: 1.1‐1.2) births. The association was stronger among multiparous versus primiparous women. No differences in emergency cesarean section, preterm birth, or neonatal intensive care admission were found, regardless of parity. Perinatal mortality increased with distance from hospital; OR = 1.5 (CI: 1.1‐2.1) per distance category. Conclusions: Older women in rural versus urban areas had a lower rate of cesarean section and increased risk of perinatal death. The risk of perinatal death increased with the distance to hospital. Further studies need to evaluate the contribution of underlying perinatal risks, access to care, and decision making regarding referral and transport.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the association between prepregnancy obesity and birth outcomes using fixed effect models comparing siblings from the same mother. Methods: A total of 7496 births to 3990 mothers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 survey are examined. Outcomes include macrosomia, gestational length, incidence of low birthweight, preterm birth, large and small for gestational age (LGA, SGA), c-section, infant doctor visits, mother’s and infant’s days in hospital post-partum, whether the mother breastfed, and duration of breastfeeding. Association of outcomes with maternal pre-pregnancy obesity was examined using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to compare across mothers and fixed effects to compare within families. Results: In fixed effect models we find no statistically significant association between most outcomes and prepregnancy obesity with the exception of LGA, SGA, low birth weight, and preterm birth. We find that prepregnancy obesity is associated with a with lower risk of low birthweight, SGA, and preterm birth but controlling for prepregnancy obesity, increases in GWG lead to increased risk of LGA. Conclusions: Contrary to previous studies, which have found that maternal obesity increases the risk of c-section, macrosomia, and LGA, while decreasing the probability of breastfeeding, our sibling comparison models reveal no such association. In fact, our results suggest a protective effect of obesity in that women who are obese prepregnancy have longer gestation lengths, and are less likely to give birth to a preterm or low birthweight infant.

        <ab>Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine whether there are differences in birth and breastfeeding outcomes for women who received labor support through a hospital-based doula program, compared with those who did not receive doula support in labor. Methods: We conducted a retrospective program evaluation to compare differences in birth outcomes between births at 37 weeks or greater with doula support and births at 37 weeks or greater without doula support through the first seven years of a hospital-based doula support program. Log-binomial regression models were used to compare differences in cesarean delivery rates, epidural use, operative vaginal delivery, Apgar scores, breastfeeding intent and early breastfeeding initiation after controlling for demographic and medical risk factors. The propensity score was included as an additional covariate in our regression model to minimize issues of selection bias. Analyses were conducted for the whole cohort of 11,471 women and by parity and provider service in subgroup analyses. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was performed to detect differences in effects over time. Results: For the whole cohort, women with doula support had significantly higher rates of breastfeeding intent and early initiation. Subgroup analysis showed that having doula support was significantly related to: (a) higher rates of breastfeeding intent and early initiation rates for all women regardless of parity or provider with the exception of multiparous women with physician providers; (b) lower rates of cesarean deliveries for primiparous women with midwife providers. Conclusion: A hospital-based doula support program is strongly related to improved breastfeeding outcomes in an urban, multicultural setting.

        <ab>Objective: To determine whether early environmental factors, such as cesarean delivery, breastfeeding, and exposure to smoking or herpes viruses, are associated with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) risk in children. Methods: This is a case-control study of pediatric NMO, multiple sclerosis (MS), and healthy subjects. Early-life exposures were obtained by standardized questionnaire. Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus 1 antibody responses were determined by ELISA. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to adjust for age at sampling, sex, race, and ethnicity. Results: Early-life exposures were obtained from 36 pediatric subjects with NMO, 491 with MS, and 224 healthy controls. Daycare (odds ratio [OR] 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14, 0.78; p &lt; 0.01) and breastfeeding (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18, 0.99; p = 0.05) were associated with lower odds of having NMO compared with healthy subjects. Cesarean delivery tended to be associated with 2-fold-higher odds of NMO compared with having MS/clinically isolated syndrome (OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.88, 4.59; p = 0.12) or with being healthy (OR 1.95, 95% CI 0.81, 4.71; p = 0.14). Sera and DNA were available for 31 subjects with NMO, 189 with MS, and 94 healthy controls. Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1, cytomegalovirus exposure, and being HLA-DRB115 positive were not associated with odds of having NMO compared with healthy subjects. Conclusions: Exposure to other young children may be an early protective factor against the development of NMO, as previously reported for MS, consistent with the hypothesis that infections contribute to disease risk modification. Unlike MS, pediatric NMO does not appear to be associated with exposures to common herpes viruses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To evaluate the distribution of women with severe maternal morbidity according to Robson Ten Group Classification System (RTGCS). Methods: Secondary analysis of a multicenter cross-sectional study in 27 obstetric units in Brazil, using RTGCS. Cases were classified into potentially life-threatening condition or a maternal near miss or death, according to severity. Certain groups were subdivided for further analysis. Cesarean delivery (CD) rates were reported. Results: Among 7,247 women with severe maternal morbidity, 73.2 percent underwent CD. Group 10 (single, cephalic, preterm) was the most prevalent (33.9%). Groups mostly associated with a severe maternal outcome were: 7 (multiparous, breech), 9 (all abnormal lies, single, term), 8 (all multiple), and 10. Groups 1 (nulliparous, single, cephalic, term, spontaneous) and 3 (multiparous, single, cephalic, term, spontaneous) were associated with better maternal outcome. Group 3 had one severe maternal morbidity to 29 cases of potentially life-threatening, but the ratio was 1:10 for women undergoing CD, indicating a worse outcome. Group 4a (multiparous, no previous CD, single, cephalic, term, induced labor) had a better maternal outcome than those delivered by CD before labor (group 4b). Hypertension was the most common condition of severity. Conclusions: The RTGCS was useful to consider severe maternal morbidity, showing groups with higher CD rates and worse maternal outcomes.

        <ab>Introduction: Pregnancy is generally viewed as a time of fulfillment and joy; however, for many women it can be a stressful event. In South Asia it is associated with cultural stigmas revolving around gender discrimination, abnormal births and genetic abnormalities. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was done at four teaching hospitals in Lahore from February, 2014 to June, 2014. A total of 500 pregnant women seen at hospital obstetrics and gynecology departments were interviewed with a questionnaire consisting of three sections: demographics, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). Pearson’s chi-squared test, bivariate correlations and multiple linear regression were used to analyze associations between the independent variables and scores on the HADS and SPS. Results: Mean age among the 500 respondents was 27.41 years (5.65). Anxiety levels in participants were categorized as normal (145 women, 29%), borderline (110, 22%) or anxious (245, 49%). Depression levels were categorized as normal (218 women, 43.6%), borderline (123, 24.6%) or depressed (159, 31.8%). Inferential analysis revealed that higher HADS scores were significantly associated with lower scores on the SPS, rural background, history of harassment, abortion, cesarean delivery and unplanned pregnancies (P &lt; .05). Social support (SPS score) mediated the relationship between the total number of children, gender of previous children and HADS score. Women with more daughters were significantly more likely to score higher on the HADS and lower on the SPS, whereas higher numbers of sons were associated with the opposite trends in the scores (P &lt; .05). Conclusion: Because of the predominantly patriarchal sociocultural context in Pakistan, the predictors of antenatal anxiety and depression may differ from those in developed countries. We therefore suggest that interventions designed and implemented to reduce antenatal anxiety and depression should take into account these unique factors.

        <ab>This study sought to examine the association between maternal HIV/AIDS infection and neonatal neurologic conditions in the state of Florida. We analyzed all births in the state of Florida from 1998 to 2007 using hospital discharge data linked to birth certificate records. The main outcomes of interest included selected neonatal neurologic complications, namely: fetal distress, cephalohematoma, intracranial hemorrhage, seizure, feeding difficulties, and other central nervous system complications. The sample size for this study was 1,645,515 records. All forms of substance abuse as well as cesarean section deliveries were more frequent in mothers with HIV/AIDS. Infants born to HIV-infected mothers showed higher proportions of feeding difficulties and seizures whereas HIV-negative mothers had a greater proportion of cases of fetal distress and cephalohematoma. Seizures and feeding difficulties are common among infants born to HIV/AIDS infected mothers. This population-based retrospective cohort study provides further understanding of the association between maternal HIV/AIDS status and neonatal neurological outcomes.

        <ab>Background: The benefits of breastfeeding to both maternal and infant health are vast and widely known. The aim of this study was to elicit the rates of exclusive breastfeeding, early initiation of breastfeeding, and colostrum feeding and to determine the attitudes, knowledge, and influences around breastfeeding in postpartum Vietnamese women. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hung Vuong Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, between December 2010 and January 2011. Postpartum women were randomly selected and interviewed within 48 hours of delivery. Results: Of the 223 women interviewed, 86% had initiated breastfeeding at the time of the interview. Modes of feeding included exclusive breastfeeding (7%), mixed feeding (79%), which included breastmilk and formula or water, and exclusive formula feeding (14%). Of the breastfeeding women, 14% had initiated breastfeeding within 60 minutes of delivery, 92% had initiated within 24 hours, and 8% had initiated after 24 hours of delivery. Of women who had initiated breastfeeding, 37% had discarded their colostrum. Factors that positively influenced breastfeeding were knowledge that breastfeeding is good for the infant, advice obtained from 'public information,' and the influence of health professionals and family on the decision to breastfeed. Factors that influenced the decision not to initiate breastfeeding included pain or fever after cesarean section and perceived lack of breastmilk after delivery. Conclusions: The rate of exclusive breastfeeding at Hung Vuong Hospital in this study was lower than the national average of 17%. Specific interventions targeting this must be formulated to increase these rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To study the effect of gestational and perinatal exposures on thymic size in 366 normal birth weight and 426 low birth weight (LBW) neonates in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. Study design: In a cross-sectional study, thymic size was measured at birth by the use of ultrasound. Information on possible determinants was collected from pregnancy cards, hospital records, and interviews with the mother. We used the log-transformed thymic index and thymus/weight index as outcome measures. Data were analyzed with adjusted linear regression models providing geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 95% CI. Results: Determinants of thymic size among normal birth weight infants were pathologic amniotic fluid (adjusted GMR for thymic index: 0.84 [0.74-0.96]) and male sex (GMR: 1.13 [1.06-1.22]). Among LBW infants, birth season (1.11 [1.01-1.22]), maternal body temperature (0.89 [0.79-0.98]), antibiotic treatment at the time of labor (0.84 [0.70-1.00]), number of pregnancy consultations (1.03 [1.00-1.05]), maternal age (0.91 [0.84-0.98]), Apgar score (1.06 [1.03-1.10]), and infant convulsions (0.44 [0.29-0.65]) were all independent determinants of thymic index but not all were determinants of thymus/weight index. Pathologic amniotic fluid and cesarean delivery were associated with thymus/weight index among LBW infants (0.85 [0.75-0.95] and 0.80 [0.67-0.96]) but were only borderline significant for thymic index. Conclusion: Exposures mainly related to stress and infections were associated with a smaller thymus, mainly in LBW infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Decision-making about mode of birth after a cesarean delivery presents challenges to women and their caregivers and requires a balance of risks and benefits according to individual circumstances. The study objective was to determine whether a decision-aid for women who have experienced previous cesarean birth facilitates informed decision-making about birth options during a subsequent pregnancy. Method: A prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial of 227 pregnant women was conducted within 3 prenatal clinics and 3 private obstetric practices in New South Wales, Australia. Women with 1 previous cesarean section and medically eligible for trial of vaginal birth were recruited at 12 to 18 weeks' gestation; 115 were randomized to the intervention group and 112 to the control group. A decision-aid booklet describing risks and benefits of elective repeat cesarean section and trial of labor was given to intervention group women at 28 weeks' gestation. Main outcome measures included level of knowledge, decisional conflict score, women's preference for mode of birth, and recorded mode of birth. Results: Women who received the decision-aid demonstrated a significantly greater increase in mean knowledge scores than the control group (increasing by 2.17 vs 0.42 points on a 15-point scale) (p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI for difference = 1.15-2.35). The intervention group demonstrated a reduction in decisional conflict score (p &lt; 0.05). The decision-aid did not significantly affect the rate of uptake of trial of labor or elective repeat cesarean section. Preferences expressed at 36 weeks were not consistent with actual birth outcomes for many women. Conclusion: A decision-aid for women facing choices about birth after cesarean section is effective in improving knowledge and reducing decisional conflict. However, little evidence suggested that this process led to an informed choice. Strategies are required to better equip organizations and practitioners to empower women so that they can translate informed preferences into practice. Further work needs to examine ways to enhance women's power in decision-making within the doctor-patient relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Concern has increased about rising rates of cesarean section and other obstetric interventions, and it has been suggested that a change in women's attitudes may be partly responsible. Our objectives were, first, to examine changes in women's antenatal willingness to accept obstetric interventions between 1987 and 2000 and, second, to look at the relationship between willingness to accept obstetric interventions and mode of birth. Methods: Data on willingness to accept obstetric interventions were collected at 35-36 weeks of pregnancy using postal questionnaires, and follow-up of women was conducted 6 weeks postnatally. Data are presented for 977 women drawn from 8 maternity units in England who were due to give birth in April to May 2000. To address the first objective, data were compared with the parent study carried out in 1987. Results: The sample had significantly more positive antenatal attitudes toward obstetric interventions than the comparable sample in 1987 (F = 42.25, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001). Willingness to accept obstetric interventions was related to mode of birth. Binary logistic regression controlling for age, education, and parity showed that women with high 'willingness to accept intervention' scores had a nearly twofold increase in the odds of an operative or instrumental birth (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.28-2.95) compared with women who had low scores. These attitudes also predicted epidural analgesia use, and differences in mode of birth were no longer significant when epidural use was included in the regression model. Conclusions: A shift toward greater willingness to accept obstetric interventions appears to have occurred since 1987, and this shift does appear to relate to mode of birth in the 2000 cohort but not in 1987. The findings suggest that epidural analgesia use mediates the link. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Newborn weight loss (NWL) in the first 3 days of life is around 6 percent of birthweight (BW). We aim to describe the determinants of an excessive and insufficient NWL in the first 96 hours of life. Methods: A sample of 1,288 full‐term singletons without congenital abnormality belonging to Generation XXI birth cohort was selected. Newborns were recruited in 2005–2006 at all public units providing obstetrical and neonatal care in Porto, Portugal. Information was collected by face‐to‐face interview and additionally abstracted from clinical records. Anthropometrics were obtained by trained examiners and newborn weight change (NWC) was estimated as (weight–BW)/BW × 100. We categorized NWL as excessive (below 10th percentile of the sample distribution of NWC: ≤−9.4% of BW), normal (between 10th and 90th percentiles: −9.3 to −4.2%) and insufficient (above 90th percentile: ≥ −4.1%). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multinomial regression models. Results: Excessive NWL was positively associated with maternal age ≥40 years (OR = 3.32, 95%CI 1.19–9.25), maternal education (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.09), cesarean delivery (OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.12–5.23), and phototherapy‐treated jaundice (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.00–2.87). Insufficient NWL was positively associated with low BW (OR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.13–6.33), and formula/mixed feeding (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.13–2.66). Conclusion: Excessive NWL was positively associated with maternal age and education, cesarean delivery, and phototherapy‐treated jaundice. Insufficient NWL reflected child's feeding. As breastfed newborns did not lose weight excessively, but newborns with formula/mixed feeding had insufficient NWL, our study supports that breastfeeding provides excellent nutrition during this period.

        <ab>Objective: The present study endeavored to identify predictors of headache during pregnancy, shortly after delivery, and at 8-week follow-up. Background: Many women suffer from headaches during pregnancy and the post-partum period. However, little is known about factors that predict headache surrounding childbirth. Methods: Secondary analysis of longitudinal cohort study of 2434 parturients hospitalized for cesarean or vaginal delivery in 4 university hospitals in the United States and Europe. Data were gathered from interviews and review of medical records shortly after delivery; 972 of the women were contacted 8 weeks later to assess persistent headache. The primary outcome measures were experiencing headache during pregnancy, headache within 72 hours after delivery, and headache at 8 weeks after delivery. Results: Of the parturients,10% experienced headache during pregnancy, 3.7% within 72 hours after delivery, and 3.6% at 8weeks postdelivery. Compared to those without a history of headache, a history of headache prior to pregnancy was the strongest predictor of headache during pregnancy (9.8% vs 23.5%; risk ratio 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 4.0). Experiencing headache during pregnancy (adjusted hazard ratioHR3.8;95% CI: 2.4 to 6.2) and receiving needle-based regional anesthesia for pain treatment (adjusted hazard ratio 2.2;95% CI: 1.1 to 4.5) were independently associated with headache within 72 hours after delivery with event rates of 11.1% and 10.5%, respectively.Compared to those without such a history, headache before pregnancy was significantly associated with experiencing headache 8weeks after delivery (4.0% vs 23.8%; risk ratio = 6.0;95%CI: 2.0 to 8.0), but headache during pregnancy or shortly after delivery was not.Several other psychosocial predictors (eg, somatization,smoking before pregnancy) were statistically associated with at least 1 headache outcome. Conclusions: A history of headache prior to pregnancy is a strong predictor of headache during and after pregnancy, the latter independent of but compounded by spinal injection. Physicians should attend to prior headache history when making decisions about pain management during and after childbirth. As the lack of formal International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICHD-II), headache diagnoses is a limitation of this study, future longitudinal studies should replicate the present design while including headache subtyping consistent with ICHD-II nosology.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the association between method of delivery (primary cesarean section vs. vaginal) and neonatal mortality risk (as well as causes of death) among very low-birth weight first-born infants in the United States. More specifically, to examine this association separately for breech/malpresenting and vertex-presenting infants, while adjusting for selected maternal characteristics, and pregnancy, labor and delivery complications. Methods: The study population was derived from the 1995-1998 birth cohort linked birth/infant death data sets. Binary and multinomial logit regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship in four very low-birth weight categories. Results: Among breech/malpresenting neonates, compared to those delivered vaginally, infants delivered by a primary cesarean section had significantly lower adjusted relative risks of death for all very low-birth weight categories and the decrease in relative risk tended to be larger with each increasing birth weight category. However, for vertex-presenting neonates, results are mixed, suggesting decreased relative mortality risks associated with primary cesarean section, which were significant for 500-749 g, not significant for 750-999 g, and barely significant for 1,000-1,249 g. In contrast, for vertex-presenting neonates weighing 1,250-1,499 g, there was a significantly increased adjusted relative risk associated with primary cesarean section. Differences in cause-specific neonatal mortality by method of delivery and presentation status were also discussed. Conclusions: Primary cesarean section appears to be associated with decreased neonatal mortality risks in each very low-birth weight category for breech/malpresenting infants, but results are mixed for vertex-presenting infants. Causal inferences should be avoided because this was an observational study by design. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>This study aimed to examine obstetric bleeding outcomes after exposure during pregnancy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic (TCAs), and other antidepressants (OADs). The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway constituted the data source for the present study. We included 57,279 pregnant women, of which 1.02% reported use of antidepressants during pregnancy, mostly SSRIs/SNRIs (0.92%). We categorized exposure according to antidepressant use in pregnancy (SSRIs/SNRIs, n = 527; TCAs/OADs, n = 59; nonexposed, nondepressed, n = 55,411) with inclusion of a disease comparison group (nonexposed, depressed, n = 1282). We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for vaginal bleeding outcomes in pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage. Compared with nonexposed subjects, first trimester exposure to SSRIs/SNRIs or TCAs/OADs did not confer any increased risk of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy (aOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72-1.16 and aOR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.36-1.92, respectively). No increased risk for vaginal bleeding in midpregnancy was observed among users of SSRIs/SNRIs (aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.50-1.31) or TCAs/OADs (aOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.26-3.53) in second trimester. Exposure to SSRIs/SNRIs during gestational week 30 to childbirth did not confer any increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal (aOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.47-1.74) or cesarean (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.51-4.22) delivery. Women in the disease comparison group presented a significant moderate increased risk of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39) and midpregnancy (aOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.55) but not postpartum. Among this Norwegian cohort of pregnant women, use of antidepressants in pregnancy was not associated with any obstetrical bleeding outcome.

        <ab>Purpose: Annual cesarean delivery rates in North America are increasing. Despite the morbidity associated with cesarean delivery, a safe preventive strategy to reduce the use of this procedure has not been forthcoming. During the 1990s, clinicians in a rural hospital developed a method of care involving prostaglandin-assisted preventive labor induction. An inverse relationship was noted between yearly hospital rates of labor induction and cesarean delivery. The purpose of our study was to compare cesarean delivery rates between practitioners who often used preventive induction and practitioners who did not, while controlling for patient mix and differences in practice style. Methods: Between 1993 and 1997, different hospital practitioners used riskguided prostaglandin-assisted preventive labor induction with differing intensity. We used a retrospective cohort design, based on the practitioner providing prenatal care, to compare birth outcomes in women exposed to this alternative method of care with those in women not exposed. Multiple logistic regression analysis controlled for patient characteristics and clustering by practitioner. Results: The exposed group (n = 794), as compared with the nonexposed group (n = 1,075), had a higher labor induction rate (31.4% vs 20.4%, P &lt; .001), a greater use of prostaglandin E₂ (23.3% vs 15.7%, P &lt; .001), and a lower cesarean delivery rate (5.3% vs 11.8%, P &lt; .001). Adjustment for cluster effects, patient characteristics, and the use of epidural analgesia did not eliminate the significant association between exposure to this preventive method of care and a lower cesarean delivery rate. Rates of other adverse birth outcomes were either unchanged or reduced in the exposed group. Conclusions: A preventive approach to reducing cesarean deliveries may be possible. This study found that practitioners who often used risk-guided, prostaglandin-assisted labor induction had a lower cesarean delivery rate without increases in rates of other adverse birth outcomes. Randomized controlled trials of this method of care are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>'Preventive Labor Induction-AMOR-IPAT' is a method designed to time induction before the fetus becomes too large or the placenta dysfunctional. In two retrospective cohort studies and one randomized trial, the developers claim to have reduced cesarean section rates and improved newborn outcomes. These claims have yet to be substantiated in an adequately powered trial, but having decided on the need for an induction, the investigators do manage inductions in a woman-centered and intimate style that has merit.

        <ab>This study systematically reviewed the psychiatric records of all BDI and BDII (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) female outpatients treated in the Lithium Clinic of the Unit of Clinical Psychopharmacology in the Teaching Hospital affiliated with the University of Cagliari from February 1976 to September 2012. We elected to study the first completed pregnancy after starting lithium (Li) treatment. Detailed demographic and clinical information were collected for each patient using all available sources, including reviews of clinical records of psychiatric visits (average on a monthly basis) with detailed information through which each episode of illness can be retrospectively verified. We used the Retrospective NIMH-Life Chart Method (Bethesda, MD)11 to evaluate the clinical course of BD, focusing particularly on pregnancies and postpartum periods (considered as the 6 months after delivery). Pregnancies were considered 'on-Li' if the patient continued treatment with Li during the entire period of pregnancy. Because recent guidelines suggest stopping Li 24 to 48 hours before a scheduled cesarean delivery or at the onset of labor in the event of spontaneous delivery, this was not considered as treatment discontinuation. Pregnancies were considered 'off-Li' if the patient discontinued therapy at any other time during pregnancy. We report severity and frequency of illness episodes during the pregnancies and postpartum periods observed, as well as maternal/neonatal short-term complications.

        <ab>Objective: Describe the demographics, injury types, mechanisms, and intents of emergency department (ED) injury visits by pregnant women and to quantify their risk of adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Through a retrospective cohort study design, Utah ED, birth, and fetal death records were probabilistically linked to identify women seen in an ED with an injury during pregnancy among births and fetal deaths from 1999 to 2002. Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of having an injury-related ED visit on various adverse pregnancy outcomes. Results: 7350 (3.9%) women experienced an injury-related ED visit during pregnancy. Motor vehicle occupant injuries were the leading mechanism of ED injury visits (22.4%). Controlling for known risks, pregnant women with an injury-related ED visit were more likely than non-injured pregnant women to experience preterm labor (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.12-1.34), placental abruption (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.08-1.65), and cesarean delivery (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.19-1.36). Infants born to women who were injured during pregnancy were more likely to be born preterm (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.12-1.34) and have low birth weight (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.1-1.35). Conclusions: Most injured pregnant women are treated and released from the ED; however, significant increased risks remain for several maternal complications and birth outcomes.

        <ab>Fetal deaths account for nearly one percent of all births in the United States. The cost of hospital care associated with fetal deaths may be substantial. However, there is very limited data on the economic burden of fetal death. We conducted a retrospective medical chart review of stillbirths at three large hospitals in Michigan over a ten-year period and identified medical complications, hospital costs, and length of stay for these deliveries. Mothers with stillbirth were matched with mothers of the same age who delivered a live-born infant at the same hospital during the same year. Our final sample was comprised of 533 stillbirths and 1,053 matched live births. Average hospital cost for stillbirth was $7,495 (± 7,015) and the average length of stay was 2.8 days (± 2.8). Having a serious maternal medical complication was associated with higher costs and longer length of stay among women with stillbirth. Early stillbirths between 20 and 28 weeks gestational age, epidural/spinal/general anesthesia, and cesarean delivery were also associated with longer length of stay. Average hospital costs for women with stillbirth were more than $750 higher than women with live births but length of stay was not significantly different between the two. This study suggests that stillbirths were associated with substantial maternal hospital costs. Future research examining the economic impact of stillbirths beyond labor and delivery such as increased costs associated with additional testing and care in subsequent pregnancies will help better understand the overall economic impact of stillbirths.

        <ab>This report presents findings from two state-based pregnancy-related reviews of deaths due to pulmonary embolism to describe prevalence, risk factors, and timing of symptoms and fatal events (N = 46). We examined the utility of state-based maternal mortality review teams as a means to gain more complete data on maternal deaths from which guidelines for prevention and intervention can be developed. The Florida Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review Team and Virginia Maternal Mortality Review Team collaborated on findings from 9 years of pregnancy-related mortality review conducted in each state. Pregnancy-related deaths due to pulmonary embolism occurring within 42 days of pregnancy between 1999 and 2007 in Florida and Virginia were identified. Retrospective review of records was conducted to obtain data on timing of the fatal event in relation to the pregnancy, risk factors, and the presence and timing of symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism. Forty-six cases of pregnancy-related death due to pulmonary embolism were identified. The combined pregnancy-related mortality ratio (PRMR) was 1.6/100,000 live births. The PRMR for patients undergoing cesarean section delivery was 2.8 compared to 0.2 among those with vaginal deliveries (95 % CI = 1.8–4.2 and 0.1–0.5 respectively). Women aged 35 and older had the highest PRMR at 2.6/100,000 live births. BMI over 30 kg/m² and presence of chronic conditions were frequently identified risk factors. One in five decedents (21.7 %) reported at least two symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism in the days before death. This combined state-based maternal death review confirms age over 35 years, obesity, and the presence of chronic conditions are risk factors for pregnancy-related mortality due to venous thromboembolism in the US. Expanding and standardizing the process of state-based reviews offers the potential for reducing pregnancy-related mortality in the US.

        <ab>The clinical application of hypnosis has been effective in obstetrics. Intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios are dreaded complications of pregnancy that may result in preterm deliveries causing increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. In this longitudinal prospective study, clinical hypnosis was used in addition to the conventional medical management in such pregnancies. The perinatal outcome was compared with the control group wherein hypnosis was not used. The hypnosis group had a significantly shorter preterm delivery rate (p = .004) and fewer incidence of low birth weight babies (p = .009). Significantly reduced operative intervention in terms of lower rate of cesarean section (p = .008) was also observed in the experimental group. Hence, the use of clinical hypnosis as a viable adjunct to medical management is suggested to help to prevent neonatal morbidity and fetal loss. A multicenter randomized, controlled clinical trial is encouraged in this area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The increasing pregnancy rate at advanced maternal age is contemporaneous with the increasing rate of cesarean birth. Several studies have found that advanced maternal age is a risk factor for cesarean birth. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between advanced maternal age and cesarean birth among nulliparous and multiparous women. Methods: To identify relevant studies, we searched the literature for articles published from January 1, 1995 to March 1, 2008, using Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and CINAHL. We also hand-searched the bibliographies of retrieved articles to identify additional related studies. We included all cohort studies and all case-control studies that examined this association in developed countries. The Cochrane Collaboration’s Review Manager software (5.0) was used to summarize the data. Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. All studies demonstrated an increased risk of cesarean birth among women at advanced maternal age compared with younger women, for both nulliparas and multiparas (relative risk varied from 1.39 to 2.76). Because we found extreme heterogeneity (both statistical and clinical) among the included studies, we did not provide a pooled estimate of the risk of cesarean birth. Conclusions: All included studies illustrated an increased risk of cesarean birth among older women. Fifteen studies adjusted this association for potential confounders, which suggests that a valid and independent association is likely to exist between advanced maternal age and cesarean birth. However, the associated factors for this increased risk are not totally understood in the literature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>A common variant in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) has been associated with response to opioid analgesia. Our previous data revealed significantly higher amounts of morphine self-administered by patients carrying the 118G allele compared to those with the 118A allele after elective cesarean section. In this study, the association of this genetic variation with pressure pain, postoperative pain scores, and amount of morphine used was investigated in 973 patients undergoing scheduled total hysterectomy under general anesthesia. Preoperative pressure pain threshold and tolerance were also measured for most patients. For pressure pain, OPRM1 genotype was not significantly associated with either pain threshold or pain tolerance. Statistically significant associations were found for postoperative pain and the total amount of morphine used, with the GG group reporting higher pain scores and using the most morphine. When analysis was stratified by ethnic group, differences in weight-adjusted morphine for the 3 genotypic groups were also significant for the Chinese and Asian Indians. These results extend our previous finding on the association of higher self-reported pain and morphine use for acute postoperative pain with OPRM1 118G to patients who had total hysterectomy under general anesthesia. Perspective: In a large cohort of patients undergoing hysterectomy, we found large variability in the self-rated pain scores and the amount of morphine required for pain relief. Both are associated with OPRM1 genotypes and preoperative experimental pressure pain threshold. Experimental pressure pain tolerance is also associated with postoperative pain.

        <ab>Objective: To identify obstetric risk factors and to elucidate the effect of prolonged rupture of the membranes on the development of cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in preterm infants. Methods: A retrospective case–control study of 95 preterm infants with the diagnosis of PVL and 245 healthy controls matched for gestational age. A total of 52 antenatal, intrapartum and neonatal characteristics were studied by univariate methods and logistic regression. Results: Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (odds ratio 2.1 [95% CI 1.3–3.4], P = .003), gestational age at PPROM (P = .025), prolonged rupture of membranes (P &lt; .0001), administration of tocolytic agents (1.8 [1.1–3.0], P = .019) and antibiotics (1.9 [1.2–3.1], P = .008) were associated with PVL. The use of tocolytic agents N24 h (P = .008), prolonged latency between the increase in maternal leukocyte count and birth (P = .034), spontaneous onset of labor (1.8 [1.0–2.9], P=.026), vaginal delivery (1.7 [1.1–2.8], P = .029) and male gender (1.5 [1.0–2.0], P=.04) were found more frequently in PVL cases. Preeclampsia (0.4 [0.1–0.9], P = .034), hypertension at booking (P = .009), sonographic IUGR (P = .020), abnormal blood flow of the umbilical artery (P = .032) and cesarean section without labor (0.5 [0.3–0.8], P = .006) were found less frequently. In logistic regression analysis, prolonged rupture of the membranes (P = .748), preeclampsia (P = .973), the use of antibiotics (P = .617) and beta-sympathomimetic tocolytic agents (P = .563) lost statistical significance, whereas birth weight (P = .036) became significant. Conclusion: PPROM and prolonged rupture of the membranes may provoke adverse effects on the neurodevelopmental outcome of the preterm fetus. These findings may have implications on the obstetric management of PPROM beyond 30 weeks of gestation. Cesarean section without labor was less likely associated with the diagnosis of PVL.

        <ab>Our objective was to examine differences in risk of cesarean delivery among diverse ethnic groups in New York City. Using cross-sectional New York City birth and hospitalization data from 1995 to 2003 (n = 961,381) we estimated risk ratios for ethnic groups relative to non-Hispanic whites and immigrant women relative to US-born women. Adjusting for insurance, pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, education, parity, birthweight, gestational age, year, medical complications, and pregnancy complications, all ethnic groups except East Asian women were at an increased risk of cesarean delivery, with the highest risk among Hispanic Caribbean women [adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.27, 95 % CI (confidence interval) = 1.24, 1.30] and African American women (aRR = 1.20, 95 % CI = 1.17, 1.23). Among Hispanic groups, immigrant status further increased adjusted risk of cesarean delivery; adjusted risk ratios for foreign-born women compared to US-born women of the same ethnic group were 1.27 for Mexican women (95 % CI = 1.05, 1.53), 1.23 for Hispanic Caribbean women (95 % CI = 1.20, 1.27), and 1.12 for Central/South American women (95 % CI = 1.04, 1.21). Similar patterns were found in subgroup analyses of low-risk women (term delivery and no pregnancy or medical complications) and primiparous women. We found evidence of disparities by ethnicity and nativity in cesarean delivery rates after adjusting for multiple risk factors. Efforts to reduce rates of cesarean delivery should address these disparities. Future research should explore potential explanations including hospital environment, provider bias, and patient preference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The health effects of antenatal maternity leave have been scarcely evaluated. In California, women are eligible for paid benefits up to 4 weeks before delivery. We explored whether leave at ≥36 weeks gestation increases gestation and birthweight, and reduces primary cesarean deliveries among full-time working women. Methods: Drawing from a 2002–2003 nested case-control study of preterm birth and low birthweight among working women in Southern California, we compared a cohort of women who took leave (n = 62) or worked until delivery (n = 385). Models weighted for probability of sampling were used to calculate hazards ratios for gestational age, odds ratios (OR) for primary cesarean delivery, and multilinear regression coefficients for birthweight. Main Findings: Leave-takers were similar to non–leave-takers on demographic and health characteristics, except that more clerical workers took leave (p = .02). Compared with non–leave-takers, leave-takers had almost 4 times lower odds of cesarean delivery after adjusting for covariates (OR, 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08–0.94). Overall, there were no marked differences in length of gestation or mean birthweight. However, in a subgroup of women whose efforts outstripped their occupational rewards, gestation was prolonged (hazard ratio for delivery each day between 36 and 41 weeks, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.93). Conclusion: Maternity leave in late pregnancy shows promise for reducing cesarean deliveries and prolonging gestation in occupationally strained women.

        <ab>Background: Following severe trauma to the brain (whether internally generated by seizures, tumors or externally caused by collision with or penetration of objects) individuals may experience initial coma state followed by slow recovery and rehabilitation treatment. At present there is no objective biometric to track the daily progression of the person for extended periods of time. Objective: We introduce new analytical techniques to process data from physically wearable sensors and help track the longitudinal progression of motions and physiological states upon the brain trauma. Setting and Participant: The data used to illustrate the methods were collected at the hospital settings from a pregnant patient in coma state. The patient had brain trauma from a large debilitating seizure due to a large tumor in the right pre-frontal lobe. Main Measures: We registered the wrist motions and the surface-skin-temperature across several daily sessions in four consecutive months. A new statistical technique is introduced for personalized analyses of the rates of change of the stochastic signatures of these patterns. Results: We detected asymmetries in the wrists’ data that identified in the dominant limb critical points of change in physiological and motor control states. These patterns could blindly identify the time preceding the baby’s delivery by C-section when the patient systematically brought her hand to her abdominal area. Changes in temperature were sharp and accompanied by systematic changes in the statistics of the motions that rendered her dominant wrist’s micro-movements more systematically reliable and predictable than those of the non-dominant writst. Conclusions: The new analytics paired with wearable sensing technology may help track the day-by-day individual progression of a patient with post brain trauma in clinical settings and in the home environment.

        <ab>To explore racial-ethnic disparities in adverse pregnancy outcomes among Medicaid recipients, and to estimate excess Medicaid costs associated with the disparities. Cross-sectional study of adverse pregnancy outcomes and Medicaid payments using data from Medicaid Analytic eXtract files on all Medicaid enrollees in fourteen southern states. Compared to other racial and ethnic groups, African American women tended to be younger, more likely to have a Cesarean section, to stay longer in the hospital and to incur higher Medicaid costs. African- American women were also more likely to experience preeclampsia, placental abruption, preterm birth, small birth size for gestational age, and fetal death/stillbirth. Eliminating racial disparities in adverse pregnancy outcomes (not counting infant costs), could generate Medicaid cost savings of $114 to $214 million per year in these 14 states. Despite having the same insurance coverage and meeting the same poverty guidelines for Medicaid eligibility, African American women have a higher rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes than White or Hispanic women. Racial disparities in adverse pregnancy outcomes not only represent potentially preventable human suffering, but also avoidable economic costs. There is a significant financial return-on-investment opportunity tied to eliminating racial disparities in birth outcomes. With the Affordable Care Act expansion of Medicaid coverage for the year 2014, Medicaid could be powerful public health tool for improving pregnancy outcomes.

        <ab>This study compares rates of trial of labor after Cesarean delivery (TOLAC) and rates of successful TOLAC between 1990 and 2009. Serial cross-sectional analyses were performed using the National Hospital Discharge Survey data to compare rates of TOLAC and TOLAC success between 1990 and 2009. Joinpoint regression was used to assess trends over time, and logistic regression with marginal effects was used to examine the unadjusted and adjusted significance and magnitude of trends. The rate of TOLAC reached a high of 51.8 % (95 % CI 47.8–55.8 %) in 1995 and a low of 15.9 % (95 % CI 13.8–18.0 %) in 2006, declined, on average, 4.2 (95 % CI −4.8 to −3.9) percentage points per year between 1996 and 2005. Rates increased significantly from 1990 to 1996 and 2005 to 2009. TOLAC success was at its highest rate in 2000, 69.8 %(95 %CI 65.2–74.3 %) and its lowest in 2008, 38.5 % (95 % CI 28.1–48.8 %). The rate of TOLAC success increased significantly between 1990 and 2000, but declined thereafter an average of 3.4 %points per year (95 % CI −4.3 to −2.5). The rate of TOLAC in the US decreased between 1996 and 2005 and the rate of successful TOLAC has declined from 2000 to 2009. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this study was to assess the safety of gabapentin (Neurontin) exposure in human pregnancy. Prospective and retrospective data concerning 51 fetuses, including 3 twin gestations, were collected from 39 women (age range 19 to 38 years) with epilepsy and other disorders exposed to gabapentin during pregnancy. Data were collected and evaluated about the 44 live births, including maternal demographics, diagnosis, treatment and complications, and fetal complications and outcomes. The results of this study showed that the rates of maternal complication, cesarean section, miscarriage, low birth weight, and malformation were less than or similar to those seen in the general population or among women with epilepsy. Gabapentin exposure during pregnancy did not lead to an increased risk for adverse maternal and fetal events in this study. However, because of the small number of patients examined in this study, additional data from more pregnancies and outcomes are needed.

        <ab>Background: Conflicting evidence on maternal and fetal safety of vaginal and cesarean childbirth after a previous cesarean makes patients and practitioners uncertain about pursuing a trial of labor or an elective repeat cesarean delivery. This review systematically evaluated and summarized the evidence related to women's preference for delivery. Methods: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Registry of Controlled Trials and the MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases were searched from 1980 to August 2002. We reviewed controlled trials, case-control studies, and observational studies that contained original patient data on preference for women with a previous cesarean delivery and that were of 'good' or 'fair' quality. Results: Women with a previous vaginal delivery were more likely to select trial of labor than women who did not have one. The most commonly cited reason for selecting trial of labor was ease of recovery and desire to return quickly to caring for other children (reported in 6 of 7 studies). Safety for the mother and/or infant was cited as an important reason for delivery choice in 4 of 11 studies. Important ethnic differences were reported. Nonwhite women were more likely to identify their provider as an important influence (39% vs 19%), and perceived labor as something to be avoided if another option resulted in a healthy baby compared with white women, who perceived labor as a challenge and an experience not to be missed. Conclusions: A woman's choice for delivery was often based on family obligations, such as the need for a shorter recovery so that she could care for her infant and children at home, rather than the safety of herself or her infant. It remains unclear if education on vaginal birth after cesarean increases the proportion of women who choose trial of labor. Future studies should evaluate the impact of education and timing of education on patient preference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To examine the relationship between obstetric risk factors and childhood autism, Asperger syndrome, and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). Study design: Registry-based case-control study from all singleton births in Finland from 1990-2005. Cases with childhood autism, Asperger syndrome, or PDD (n = 4713) were identified from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Each case was matched to 4 controls on sex, date of birth, and place of birth. Information on obstetric risk factors was from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses. Results: When adjusted with confounders, childhood autism was associated with maternal high blood pressure (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.1-2.1, P = .018), Apgar scores less than 7 (1 minute, OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.1-2.0, P = .021), and neonatal treatment with monitoring (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.9, P = .038). PDD was associated with induced labor (OR 1.25 95% CI 1.1-1.5, P = .007), planned cesarean delivery (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.1-1.7, P = .009), 1-minute Apgar scores 7-8 ( OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, P = .008) and less than 7 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03-1.8, P = .032), and neonatal intensive care unit treatment (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.2-2.0, P = .003). Asperger syndrome was associated only with 1-minute Apgar scores 7-8 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03-1.4, P = .018). Conclusions: Low Apgar scores as well as conditions requiring neonatal special follow-up are important risk factors for childhood autism and PDD. These findings suggest that fetal distress is a potential risk factor for these disorders, but not for Asperger syndrome. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Studying populations with low cesarean delivery rates can identify strategies for reducing unnecessary cesareans in other patient populations. Native American women have among the lowest cesarean delivery rates of all United States populations, yet few studies have focused on Native Americans. The study purpose was to determine the rate and risk factors for cesarean delivery in a Native American population. Methods: We used a case-control design nested within a cohort of Native American live births, ≥ 35 weeks of gestation (n = 789), occurring at an Indian Health Service hospital during 1996-1999. Data were abstracted from the labor and delivery logbook, the hospital's primary source of birth certificate data. Univariate and multivariate analyses examined demographic, prenatal, obstetric, intrapartum, and fetal factors associated with cesarean versus vaginal delivery. Results: The total cesarean rate was 9.6 percent (95% CI 7.2-12.0). Nulliparity, a medical diagnosis, malpresentation, induction, labor length &gt; 12.1 hours, arrested labor, fetal distress, meconium, and gestations &lt; 37 weeks were each significantly associated with cesarean delivery in unadjusted analyses. The final multivariate model included a significant interaction between induction and arrested labor (p &lt; 0.001); the effect of arrested labor was far greater among induced (OR 161.9) than noninduced (OR 6.0) labors. Other factors significantly associated with cesarean delivery in the final logistic model were an obstetrician labor attendant (OR 2.4; p = 0.02) and presence of meconium (OR 2.3; p = 0.03). Concusions: Despite a higher prevalence of medical risk factors for cesarean delivery, the rate at this hospital was well below New Mexico (16.4%, all races) and national (21.2%, all races) cesarean rates for 1998. Medical and practice-related factors were the only observed independent correlates of cesarean delivery. Implementation of institutional and practitioner policies common to the Indian Health Service may reduce cesarean deliveries in other populations (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: The proportion of cesarean sections is increasing in Canada overall and in British Columbia in particular. It has been suggested that this increase is partially the result of women requesting the procedure, although the prevalence of patientinitiated elective cesarean section is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of probable elective cesarean and physician-suggested elective cesarean section among nulliparous women who had a cesarean section in British Columbia, Canada. Methods: An electronic search of patient charts from seven British Columbia hospitals between June 1, 2002, and May 31, 2004, was completed and potential nulliparous women seeking elective cesarean were identified. Any women with medical factors predisposing them to a cesarean section were excluded. Identified charts were then subjected to individual chart review by two independent researchers to ensure accuracy of classification into a cohort of women with probable patient-initiated elective cesarean section. Results: For the study period, 10,546 nulliparous women gave birth at the seven study hospitals and 3,301 delivered by means of cesarean section. Of these 3,301 women, 36 were judged to have had a patient-initiated elective cesarean. These 36 women represented 0.34 percent of all nulliparous births and 1.09 percent of all nulliparous cesarean births. Those judged to have selected an elective cesarean were significantly older and had babies with a lower gestational age than women with a nonelective cesarean section. No significant differences between the two groups were found with respect to maternal weight, length of stay for the mother or baby, newborn birthweight, or special care nursery days. Conclusions: Overall, the prevalence of nulliparous women judged to have had a patient-initiated elective cesarean was found to be low and is not likely to be substantially contributing to the rising proportion of cesarean births.

        <ab>In this study, we evaluated the effect of dexamethasone used as a prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting on the incidence of postdural puncture headache (PDPH) in pregnant women receiving spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study, 372 women under spinal anesthesia received 8 mg of dexamethasone or placebo intravenously just after the umbilical cord was clamped. The rate of PDPH and correlated risk factors were evaluated. The prevalence of nausea and vomiting in the dexamethasone and placebo groups was 54.4 and 51.7 %, respectively. There was no statistically meaningful difference between the results (P value = 0.673). The overall incidence rate of PDPH was 10.8 %, with 28 cases from the dexamethasone group compared with 11 subjects from the placebo group (P value = 0.006). This effect was most prominent on the first day (P value = 0.046) and disappeared on the second day after spinal anesthesia (P value = 0.678). Prophylactic treatment with 8 mg of dexamethasone not only increases the severity and incidence of PDPH, but is also ineffective in decreasing the prevalence of intra-operative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section. The treatment is a significant risk factor for the development of PDPH. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Analgesia and coping with labor pain can prevent suffering during childbirth. Nonpharmacologic methods help women manage labor pain. Strong evidence is available for the efficacy of continuous one‐to‐one support from a woman trained to provide nonmedical care during labor, immersion in warm water during first‐stage labor, and sterile water injected intracutaneously or subcutaneously at locations near a woman's lumbosacral spine to reduce back‐labor pain. Sterile water injections also reduce the incidence of cesarean deliveries. Nitrous oxide labor analgesia is not potent, but helps women relax, gives them a sense of control, and reduces and distracts their perception of pain. It is inexpensive; can be administered and discontinued safely, simply, and quickly; has no adverse effects on the normal physiology and progress of labor; and does not require intensive monitoring or co‐interventions. Parenteral opioids provide mild‐to‐moderate labor pain relief, but cause side effects. Although observational studies have found associations between maternal use of opioids and neonatal complications, little higher level evidence is available except that meperidine is associated with low Apgar scores. Patient‐controlled intravenous administration of remifentanil provides better analgesia and satisfaction than other opioids, but can cause severe side effects; continuous monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, anesthesia supervision, one‐to‐one nursing, and availability of oxygen are recommended. The demand for inexpensive, simple, safe but effective labor pain management for women will undoubtedly increase in places that lack wide access to it now.

        <ab>Comments on an article by Krista F. Huybrechts et al. (see record [rid]2015-27713-006[/rid]). Huybrechts et al. found that maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in late pregnancy was associated with a potential increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The source cohort was restricted to women with a depression diagnosis, and a logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios for PPHN associated with antidepressant exposure. However, the authors decided not to adjust for cesarean delivery because it has been shown that conditioning on such an intermediate perinatal factor is susceptible to over adjustment bias. Previous reports have suggested that cesarean delivery may be requested in the absence of any medical indication when psychosocial adversity and maternal depression are present. It is undoubtedly a challenging task to collect data regarding this issue due to various methodological, practical, and policy-related limitations.Yet the effect on the association between maternal use of SSRIs and PPHN that is exerted by cesarean delivery related to medical vs non medical indications deserves further research.

        <ab>Background: The current investigation is a follow-up of a study on women's memory of childbirth, which showed that 60 percent made the same assessment of their overall birth experience at 1 year after delivery as they did at 2 months postpartum, and 24 percent had became more negative and 16 percent more positive. The study purpose was to gain some understanding of what factors make some women change their assessment over time. Methods: Data from a longitudinal cohort study of 2,428 women who completed questionnaires in early pregnancy, at 2 months, and at 1 year after birth were analyzed. Two subsamples were studied: 1,451 women who said childbirth was a positive experience at 2 months and 151 who said it was a negative experience. Comparisons were made, within each sample, between those who made the same assessment at 1 year and those who had changed their view, with respect to psychosocial background, labor outcomes, infant health outcomes during first year, and experiences of intrapartum care. Results: Changing the assessment from positive to less positive, mostly to 'mixed feelings,' was associated with difficult childbirth, such as painful labor and cesarean section; dissatisfaction with intrapartum care; and psychosocial problems, such as single status, depressive symptoms, and worry about the birth in early pregnancy. Changing the assessment from negative to less negative was associated with less worry about the birth in early pregnancy and a more positive experience of support by the birth-attending midwife. Conclusions: This study supported the view that measures of satisfaction with childbirth soon after delivery may be colored by relief that labor is over and the happy birth of a baby. More negative aspects may take longer to integrate. Supportive care may have long-term effects and may protect some women from a long-lasting negative experience.

        <ab>Background and Objectives: Research has indicated that the buprenorphine‐mono product yields maternal outcomes similar to methadone and a less severe neonatal abstinence syndrome. However, maternal and neonatal outcomes following buprenorphine + naloxone exposure during pregnancy have not been documented. Methods: Retrospective chart review identified 10 opioid‐dependent pregnant women treated with the buprenorphine + naloxone film product between January, 2010‐June, 2011. Seven maternal outcome measures—weight gain, fetal presentation at delivery, Cesarean delivery, analgesia during delivery, urine drug screening results at delivery, number of days of maternal hospital stay, and began breastfeeding following delivery—and eleven neonatal outcome measures—gestational age at delivery, 1‐ and 5‐minute Apgar scores, head circumference, length, and weight at birth, treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), total amount of morphine sulfate needed to treat NAS, length of hospital stay for NAS treatment, and length of hospital stay—were extracted from medical records. Results: Maternal findings were unremarkable, and comparable with what might be found following treatment with the buprenorphinemono product. Neonates were full‐term with normal birth parameters. Four neonates were treated for NAS, and number of days treated for NAS and number of hospital days were in line with values reported for the buprenorphine‐mono product. Conclusions: Findings suggest no obvious significant adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes related to the use of buprenorphine + naloxone for the treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy. Scientific Significance: These initial findings underscore the need for future research to systematically examine the relative safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine + naloxone for mother, fetus, and child.

        <ab>Background: We wished to investigate whether women with a history of eating disorders have an increased risk for adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. Study design: A retrospective study was conducted comparing pregnancy complications in patients with and without eating disorders. Deliveries occurred during the years 1988–2009 in a tertiary medical center. Women lacking prenatal care and with multiple gestations were excluded from the study. Stratified analyses were performed using multivariable logistic regression models. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: During the study period, of 117,875 singleton deliveries, 122 (0.1%) occurred in patients with eating disorders. Eating disorders were significantly associated with fertility treatments (5.7% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.047), intrauterine growth restriction (7.4% vs. 2.3%, p &lt; 0.001), term low birth weight (&lt; 2500g) (7.4% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.002), preterm delivery (15.6% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.002), and cesarean delivery (25.4% vs. 15.0%, p = 0.001). Using multivariable analyses, low birth weight (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-5.0), preterm delivery (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.6), and cesarean section (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9) were significantly associated with eating disorders. Conclusions: Eating disorders are associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Accordingly, careful surveillance is needed for early detection of possible complications.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the relationship between gestational age and mental and psychomotor development scores in healthy infants born between 37 and 41 weeks. Methods: The cohort included 1562 participants enrolled during infancy in an iron deficiency anemia preventive trial in Santiago, Chile. All participants were healthy, full-term (37–41 weeks) infants who weighed 3 kg or more at birth. Development at 12 months was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Using generalized linear modeling, we analyzed the association between gestational age and 1-year-old developmental status, taking into account potential confounders including birth weight percentile, gender, socioeconomic status, the home environment, iron status, and iron supplementation. Results: For each additional week of gestation, the Mental Development Index increased by 0.8 points (95% confidence interval = 0.2–1.4), and the Psychomotor Development Index increased by 1.4 points (95% confidence interval = 0.6–2.1) controlling for birth weight percentile, gender, socioeconomic status, and home environment. Conclusions: In a large sample of healthy full-term infants, developmental scores obtained using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 12 months increased with gestational age (37–41 weeks). There is increasing evidence that birth at 39 to 41 weeks provides developmental advantages compared with birth at 37 to 38 weeks. Because cesarean deliveries and early-term inductions have increased to 40% of all births, consideration of ongoing brain development during the full-term period is an important medical and policy issue.

        <ab>Prenatal and perinatal risk factors associated with intellectual disability (ID) were studied in 8-year-old Utah children from a 1994 birth cohort (N = 26,108) using broad ascertainment methods and birth records following the most current recording guidelines. Risk factor analyses were performed inclusive and exclusive of children with a known or suspected underlying genetic disorder. Risk factors identified were poly/oligohydramnios, advanced paternal/maternal age, prematurity, fetal distress, premature rupture of membranes, primary/repeat cesarean sections, low birth weight, assisted ventilation greater than 30 min, small-for-gestational age, low Apgar scores, and congenital infection. Although several risk factors lost significance once children with underlying genetic disorders were excluded, socioeconomic variables were among those that maintained a prominent association with increased ID risk.

        <ab>This prospective survey study assessed the knowledge of reproductive outcomes that are affected by obesity among women in an urban community. A total of 207 women attending a community fair on the south side of Chicago participated in the study. A survey assessing knowledge of BMI and of the effects of obesity on general, cardiometabolic and reproductive health outcomes was administered. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 70 years (mean ± SD, 48.6 ± 12.9 years) and ranged in BMI from 17.3 to 52.1 kg/m² (mean ± SD, 31.2 ± 6.7 kg/m²). The following percentages of women were aware that obesity increases the risk of miscarriage (37.5 %), irregular periods (35.8 %), infertility (33.9 %), cesarean section (30.8 %), breast cancer (28.0 %), birth defects (23.7 %), stillbirth (14.1 %), and endometrial cancer (18.1 %). This study found that while women in an urban community are aware of the cardiometabolic risks associated with obesity, they demonstrate limited knowledge of the effects of obesity on reproductive outcomes. Public education is needed to increase knowledge and awareness of the reproductive consequences of obesity. Women of reproductive age may be uniquely responsive to obesity education and weight loss intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Context: Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAS) is a common cause of hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Risk factors for this condition have not been clearly defined. Objective: To determine maternal and infant characteristics associated with PAS. Design, Setting, and Patients: Case-control study nested within the cohort of all 199176 infants born from 1997 through 2002 in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, a managed care organization providing care for more than 3 million residents of northern California. Case patients were confirmed by review of brain imaging and medical records (n=40). Three controls per case were randomly selected from the study population. Main Outcome Measure: Association of maternal and infant complications with risk of PAS. Results: The population prevalence of PAS was 20 per 100000 live births. The majority (85%) of infants with PAS were delivered at term. The following prepartum and intrapartum factors were more common among case than control infants: primiparity (73% vs 44%, P=.002), fetal heart rate abnormality (46% vs 14%, P&lt;.001), emergency cesarean delivery (35% vs 13%, P=.002), chorioamnionitis (27% vs 11%, P=.03), prolonged rupture of membranes (26% vs 7%, P=.002), prolonged second stage of labor (25% vs 4%, P&lt;.001), vacuum extraction (24% vs 11%, P=.04), cord abnormality (22% vs 6%, P=.01), preeclampsia (19% vs 5%, P=.01), and oligohydramnios (14% vs 3%, P=.01). Risk factors independently associated with PAS on multivariate analysis were history of infertility (odds ratio [OR], 7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-45.0), preeclampsia (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.3-22.0), prolonged rupture of membranes (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.1-12.8), and chorioamnionitis (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.5). The rate of PAS increased dramatically when multiple risk factors were present. Conclusions: Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke in infants is associated with several independent maternal risk factors. How these complications, along with their potential effects on the placenta and fetus, may play a role in causing perinatal stroke deserves further study.

        <ab>Background: The Inuulitsivik midwifery service is a community-based, Inuitled initiative serving the Hudson coast of the Nunavik region of northern Québec. This study of outcomes for the Inuulitsivik birth centers, aims to improve understanding of maternity services in remote communities. Methods: We used a retrospective review of perinatal outcome data collected at each birth at the Inuulitsivik birth centers to examine outcomes for 1,372 labors and 1,382 babies from 2000 to 2007. Data were incomplete for some indicators, particularly for transfers to Montreal. Results: Findings revealed low rates of intervention with safe outcomes in this young, largely multiparous 'all risk' Inuit population. Ninety-seven percent of births were documented as spontaneous vaginal deliveries, and 85 percent of births were attended by midwives. Eighty-six percent of the labors occurred in Nunavik, whereas 13.7 percent occurred outside Nunavik. The preterm birth rate was found to be 10.6 percent. Postpartum hemorrhage was documented in 15.4 percent of women; of these cases, 6.9 percent had blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. Four fetal deaths (2.9 per 1,000) and five neonatal deaths (&lt; 3.6 per 1,000) were documented. Nine percent (9%) of births involved urgent transfers of mother or baby. The most common reasons for medical evacuation were preterm labor and preeclampsia, and preterm birth was the most common reason for urgent neonatal transfer. Conclusions: The success of the Innulitsivik midwifery service rests on the knowledge and skills of the Inuit midwives, and support of an interprofessional health team. Our study points to the potential for safe, culturally competent local care in remote communities without cesarean section capacity. Our findings support recommendations for integration of midwifery services and Aboriginal midwifery education programs in remote communities.

        <ab>Aim: To longitudinally assess the neurodevelopmental outcomes of late preterm infants (LPI) through the first year of life and to investigate for perinatal conditions that may affect developmental outcomes. Methods: The study population comprised of 124 LPI, born in a single Israeli inborn center over an eight months period. Thirty-three term infants (TI) were recruited for comparison. Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) for gross motor evaluation was performed at 6 months of age and the Griffiths Mental Development Scales (GMDS) were performed at 12 months (chronological age). Maternal and neonatal covariates, potentially associated with low developmental scores, were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression models. Results: At chronological age of 6 and 12 months, LPI performed significantly lower than TI on all subscales, but when scores were corrected for post conception age, developmental scores were similar in the two groups. In a multivariate model of logistic regression, male gender, emergent cesarean section and higher maternal education (&gt;14 years) were found to be associated with increased risk for lower developmental scores at 12 month of age in LPI. Conclusions: LPI do not complete their neurodevelopmental maturation by the first year of life. Males and those born after emergent cesarean section (CS) are at increased risk for lower developmental scores. Correction of age to term birth in LPI may still be needed at this age.

        <ab>Oxytocin is commonly used in obstetrics for labor induction and augmentation. Careful assessment of the individual clinical situation based on indications and contraindications is essential to enhancing safe and effective use. Counseling the woman and her partner regarding potential risks and benefits before use is necessary to promote informed consent. At least 39 weeks of gestation is required for elective labor induction. Recent research has shown that deferring elective induction until cervical readiness has been achieved without the use of pharmacologic agents can be beneficial in reducing the risk of cesarean birth associated with elective induction. A conservative physiologic oxytocin protocol for labor induction and augmentation is recommended to minimize the risk of side effects. Although treatment of excessive uterine activity related to oxytocin has not been studied prospectively, several interventions such as maternal repositioning, an intravenous fluid bolus, and discontinuation of the oxytocin infusion are beneficial in returning uterine activity to normal, based on retrospective review of oxytocin-induced tachysystole. Perinatal quality measures from the National Quality Forum and the Joint Commission can be useful in monitoring care related to induction of labor. These include elective births before 39 weeks of pregnancy and cesarean births for low-risk, first-birth mothers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>This systematic review of 58 observational studies identified hypothetical causal mechanisms explaining the effects of short and long intervals between pregnancies on maternal, perinatal, infant, and child health, and critically examined the scientific evidence for each causal mechanism hypothesized. The following hypothetical causal mechanisms for explaining the association between short intervals and adverse outcomes were identified: maternal nutritional depletion, folate depletion, cervical insufficiency, vertical transmission of infections, suboptimal lactation related to breastfeeding–pregnancy overlap, sibling competition, transmission of infectious diseases among siblings, incomplete healing of uterine scar from previous cesarean delivery, and abnormal remodeling of endometrial blood vessels. Women's physiological regression is the only hypothetical causal mechanism that has been proposed to explain the association between long intervals and adverse outcomes. We found growing evidence supporting most of these hypotheses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Late preterm infants (LPIs) (34–36 weeks’ gestation) account for up to 75% of preterm births and constitute a significant proportion of all neonatal admissions. This study assessed the impact of neonatal intensive or high-dependency care (IC) on developmental outcomes of LPIs at 3 years of age. Methods: This cohort study included 225 children born late preterm in Northern Ireland during 2006. Children born late preterm who received IC were compared with children born late preterm who did not receive IC. Cognitive, motor, and language skills were assessed by using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. Growth was assessed by using anthropometric measures of height and weight. Results: LPIs who received IC were more often less mature (34 weeks’ gestation), with lower birth weight (≤ 2500 g) and Apgar scores (&lt; 7 at 5 minutes) compared with the control group. They were more often born by cesarean delivery and more likely to have received resuscitation at birth. At 3 years of age, children born late preterm who received IC demonstrated similar cognitive, motor, and language skills compared with children in the control group. Measurements of growth also did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions: Despite having increased maternal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors, there were no significant differences in early childhood development between LPIs who received IC and those who did not. LPIs do not receive routine follow-up after IC and this study provides useful and reassuring data for parents and clinicians on the longer-term outcome of this infant group.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the association between gestational weight gain and adverse maternal and infant outcomes among overweight women [body mass index (BMI) 26.0–29.0 kg/m²]. Methods: A population-based cohort study using birth certificate data (1990–2004) from 34,143 singleton, full-term deliveries to nulliparous, Missouri residents ages 18–35. Gestational weight gain was divided into three categories: below Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations (&lt;15 lbs), within IOM recommendations (15–25 lbs), and above IOM recommendations (&gt;25 lbs). Categories of 10-lb increments were also evaluated. The primary outcomes were preeclampsia, cesarean section, macrosomia, low birth weight (LBW), and perinatal death. Adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Mantel–Haenszel pooled estimator. Results: Compared to women who gained 15–25 lbs, women who gained &lt;15 lbs were 0.8 (95% CI 0.6–1.0), 0.9 (0.8–1.0), 0.6 (0.5–0.8), and 1.7 (1.4–2.2) times as likely to have preeclampsia, cesarean section, macrosomia, and LBW, respectively. Conversely, women who gained &gt;25 lbs were 1.7 (1.5–1.9), 1.3 (1.2–1.4), 2.1 (1.9–2.3), and 0.6 (0.5–0.7) times as likely to have preeclampsia, cesarean section, macrosomia, and LBW, respectively. The lowest risk of adverse outcomes was for women who gained in the 6–14 and 15–24 lb categories. There was no association between gestational weight gain and perinatal death. Conclusions: Increasing gestational weight gain appears to decrease the risk of LBW but elevates the risks of preeclampsia, cesarean section, and macrosomia. Overweight women should gain within current IOM recommendations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: A challenge of obstetric care is to optimize maternal and infant health outcomes and the mother’s experience of childbirth with the least possible intervention in the normal process. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modified birth center care on obstetric procedures during delivery and on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Methods: In a cohort study 2,555 women who signed in for birth center care during pregnancy were compared with all 9,382 low‐risk women who gave birth in the standard delivery ward in the same hospital from March 2004 to July 2008. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI) and adjusted for maternal background characteristics, elective cesarean section, and gestational age. Results: The modified birth center group included fewer emergency cesarean sections (primiparas: OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.58–0.83; multiparas: OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.23–0.51), and in multiparas the vacuum extraction rate was reduced (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.26–0.67). In addition, epidural analgesia was used less frequently (primiparas: OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.41–0.53; multiparas: OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.20–0.32). Fetal distress was less frequently diagnosed in the modified birth center group (primiparas: OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59–0.87; multiparas: OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.29–0.69), but no statistically significant differences were found in neonatal hypoxia, low Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes, or proportion of perinatal deaths (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.14–1.13). Anal sphincter tears were reduced (primiparas: OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55–0.98; multiparas: OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.20–0.83). Conclusion: Midwife‐led comprehensive care with the same medical guidelines as in standard care reduced medical interventions without jeopardizing maternal and infant health.

        <ab>Background: This study aims to examine the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, cesarean sections (CS) and babies born small for gestational age (SGA)] in pregnant women with myasthenia gravis (MG), using a 3-year population-based database, taking characteristics of infant and mother into consideration. Methods: This study used two nationwide population-based datasets: the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Dataset and the Taiwan birth certificate registry. We identified 163 pregnant women with MG during 2001–2003 as the study cohort and 815 randomly selected pregnant women as a comparison cohort. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: The results showed that, although these patterns did not reach a statistically significant level, mothers with MG had higher percentages of LBW (6.8%, vs. 5.6%), SGA (17.8%, vs. 14.1%) and cesarean deliveries (44.8%, vs. 37.4%), except for preterm births (8.1%, vs. 8.1%). After adjusting for highest maternal education level, marital status, family monthly income and infant gender and parity, the odds ratios (OR) of LBW, preterm birth, SGA infants, and cesarean delivery for mothers with MG were 1.19 (95% CI = 0.60–2.38), 1.00 (95% CI = 0.54–1.87), 1.30 (95% CI = 0.83–2.04), and 1.33 (95% CI = 0.94–1.88), respectively, as compared to unaffected mothers. Conclusions: We conclude that there were no statistically significant differences in the risk of having preterm, LBW, SGA infants and cesarean deliveries between women with and without MG.

        <ab>Background: Cervical dilatation is commonly documented on a partogram indicating the expected rate of progress of labor. Although deviations from such a line can be used to indicate abnormal progress, what constitutes the 'normal' rate of cervical dilation is still largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to assess the variability of the rate of cervical dilation in nulliparous women and to determine whether the rate of labor was independent of dilation on admission. Methods: We analyzed a cohort of consecutive nulliparous women with spontaneous labor at term and singleton fetuses in cephalic presentation. Exclusion criteria were gestational age less than 37 weeks, induction of labor, or the presence of a uterine scar. Management of labor was standardized using set protocols of care. Active labor was diagnosed as regular contractions every 10 minutes or less, lasting more than 40 seconds, with cervical effacement more than 80 percent and dilation of 2 cm. Vaginal examinations were performed by a dedicated midwife every 2 hours. Amniotomy was performed for slow progress or arrest of dilation over 2 hours. Oxytocin was administered for arrest of cervical dilation for 2 hours with membranes ruptured. Data pertaining to cases ending in cesarean delivery were included up to the time of cesarean section. Results: The study sample comprised 1,119 women at 39.7 ± 1.1 weeks with an average duration of labor of 4.1 ± 2.4 hours. The rate of oxytocin use was 27 percent and of epidural analgesia 5 percent. The rate of oxytocin use was inversely related to cervical dilation on admission. Cesarean delivery was performed in 6 percent of women. Duration of labor at each centimeter of cervical dilation on admission showed a broad distribution (e.g., at 4 cm: median = 5.5, range: 0.8–12.5 hr). The rate of labor progression (expressed as the slope of the dilation‐vs‐time curve) was approximately 1.5 cm/hr, and it was essentially independent of cervical dilation on admission (r = 0.034, p = 0.267). A deceleration phase seemed to be present toward the end of the active phase of labor (approximately 9 cm). Conclusion: In our setting, the rate of labor in nulliparous women at term was highly variable, and it did not appear to be affected by cervical dilation on admission.

        <ab>Background: Little is known about how anxiety disorders affect pregnancy outcomes. Therefore we investigated the impact of one anxiety disorder, blood- and injection phobia, on obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods: From a population-based prospectively collected cohort we compared an index group of 110 women with blood- and injection phobia with a control group of 220 women. Standardized medical records were used to collect data. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes e.g. elective cesarean, prematurity, and small for gestational age were used as the main outcome measures. Results: Women with blood- and injection phobia stated more often a fear of childbirth (p &lt; 0.001) and were more frequently delivered by elective cesarean section (p = 0.032). The incidence of premature delivery (p = 0.028), neonatal morbidity (p = 0.001) and the risk of having a baby born small for gestational age (p = 0.009) was higher among women with blood-and injection phobia. Limitations: The medical records, from which all information is drawn, despite standardization, sometimes may lack some information. However, this dilemma exists in both groups. Conclusions: Women with an anxiety disorder such as blood- and injection phobia are at increased risk for adverse obstetric outcomes, premature delivery and for having a baby born with higher neonatal morbidity. It therefore seems important to identify and treat women with anxiety disorders without delay early during pregnancy in an effort to minimize risks of complications for the woman herself and the child.

        <ab>Objective of this study was to assess the relationship between method of delivery and breastfeeding. Using data (2005–2006) from the longitudinal Infant Feeding Practices Study II (n = 3,026) we assessed the relationship between delivery method (spontaneous vaginal, induced vaginal, emergency cesarean, and planned cesarean) and breastfeeding: initiation, any breastfeeding at 4 weeks, any breastfeeding at 6 months, and overall duration. We used SAS software to analyze data using multivariable analyses adjusting for several confounders, including selected demographic characteristics, participants’ pre-delivery breastfeeding intentions and attitude, and used event-history analysis to estimate breastfeeding duration by delivery method. We found no significant association between delivery method and breastfeeding initiation. In the fully adjusted models examining breastfeeding duration to 4 weeks with spontaneous vaginal delivery group as the reference, those with induced vaginal deliveries were significantly less likely to breastfeed [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.53; 95 % CI = 0.38–0.71]; and no significant relationship was observed for those who had planned or emergency cesarean deliveries. Again, compared with spontaneous vaginal delivery group, those with induced vaginal [AOR = 0.60; 96 % CI = 0.47–0.78] and emergency cesarean [AOR = 0.68; 96 % CI = 0.48–0.95] deliveries were significantly less likely to breastfeed at 6 months. Median breastfeeding duration was 45.2 weeks among women with spontaneous vaginal, 38.7 weeks among planned cesarean, 25.8 weeks among induced vaginal and 21.5 weeks among emergency cesarean deliveries. While no significant association was observed between delivery method and breastfeeding initiation; breastfeeding duration varied substantially with method of delivery, perhaps indicating a need for additional support for women with assisted deliveries.

        <ab>Background: Decisions about method of birth should be evidence based. In Australia, the rising rate of cesarean section has not been limited to births after spontaneous conception. This study aimed to investigate cesarean section among women giving birth after in vitro fertilization (IVF). Methods: Retrospective population-based study was conducted using national registry data on IVF treatment. The study included 17,019 women who underwent IVF treatment during 2003 to 2005 and a national comparison population of women who gave birth in Australia. The outcome measure was cesarean section. Results: Crude rate of cesarean section was 50.1 percent versus 28.9 percent for all other births. Single embryo transfer was associated with the lowest (40.7%) rate of cesarean section. Donor status and twin gestation were associated with significantly higher rates of cesarean section (autologous, 49.0% vs donor, 74.9%; AOR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.80, 2.69) and (singleton, 45.0% vs twin gestations, 75.7%; AOR: 3.81, 95% CI: 3.46, 4.20). The gestation-specific rate (60.1%) of cesarean section peaked at 38 weeks for singleton term pregnancies. Compared with other women, cesarean section rates for assisted reproductive technology term singletons (27.8% vs 43.8%, OR: 2.02 [95% CI: 1.95–2.10]) and twins (62.0% vs 75.7%, OR: 1.92 [95% CI: 1.74–2.11]) were significantly higher. Conclusions: Rates for cesarean section appear to be disproportionately high in term singleton births after assisted reproductive technology. Vaginal birth should be supported and the indications for cesarean section evidence based. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Comments on articles by Wax and colleagues (2004, 2005) indicating that an increasing number of women request an elective primary cesarean section in the absence of medical or obstetric indications and that many obstetricians accept such requests. In one of these articles, they reviewed the literature and concluded that available data on mortality and morbidity, 'although not robust,' favor vaginal delivery. The conclusions of the analyses have some limitations, because some data are derived from observational studies involving comparisons of groups that are not randomly assigned. The interpretation of observational data should be viewed with caution, since it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of cesarean section from the effects of the indications for cesarean section. Despite the limitations, the available data suggest that cesarean section is associated with significant risks, which should be taken into account before any decision is made to perform a trial on patient choice cesarean section.

        <ab>Objective: To assess patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) versus patient controlled analgesia (PCA) for postcesarean analgesia and to determine the impact of analgesic modality on breastfeeding in the first 24 hours postpartum. Design: A retrospective, descriptive, comparative, correlational design. Setting: A metropolitan, community, teaching hospital in the northeast United States. Participants: Medical records for all women with cesarean births in 2007 of at least 34 weeks gestational age (N = 621). Methods: Following Institutional Review Board approval, electronic medical records and clinical charts were reviewed by the study team. Data were analyzed with PASW version 18.0. Results: Women with PCEA reported significantly less average pain (p = .000) and required significantly less analgesic adjuvant medication doses (p = .038) than women with PCA. Statistically significant negative correlations were found for average total pain score with number of breastfeeding sessions (p = .023). Controlling for confounders, women with PCEA had 2.2 times the odds of mild pain compared to PCA (p = .03). Women with mild pain (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.4, p = .03), term neonate (aOR = 3.2, p = .006), breastfeeding within 2 hours (aOR = 3.2, p = .000), and no supplemental feedings (aOR = 6.9, p = .002) had significantly greater odds of breastfeeding 6+ times in the first 24 hours. Conclusion: Patient-controlled epidural anesthesia confers greater pain control postcesarean than PCA. Women with greater pain are less likely to breastfeed six or more times within the first 24 hours. This could potentially affect duration of breastfeeding. Intraprofessional measures to improve pain management are warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objectives: We examined whether interpersonal processes of care (IPC) were associated with cesarean delivery. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 1308 postpartum women at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Walnut Creek, CA (KP-WC), and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) from 2004 to 2006. Using interview and medical record data, logistic regression analyses estimated the odds of cesarean delivery as a function of IPC domains. Results: After adjustment for demographic and reproductive factors, women at KP-WC who reported higher scores for their provider’s 'elicitation of patient concerns and responsiveness' were less likely to have delivered by cesarean, whereas women who reported higher scores for 'empowerment and self-care' were more likely. At KP-WC, women who reported low English proficiency were less likely to have delivered by cesarean than women who reported high proficiency. At SFGH, none of the IPC measures were significant; however, younger age was associated with a lower risk of cesarean delivery, whereas higher educational attainment was associated with an increased risk. Conclusions: To reduce record-high rates of cesarean delivery, more emphasis should be placed on addressing the nonmedical factors associated with operative delivery.

        <ab>Background: An earlier matched cohort study in the United Kingdom found a significantly higher perinatal mortality rate for births booked under an independent midwife compared with births in National Health Service units (1.7% [25/1,508] vs 0.6% [45/7,366]). This study examined independent midwives’ management and decision making in the 15 instances of perinatal death that occurred at term. Methods: Thematic analysis of independent midwives’ case notes was performed in instances of perinatal mortality. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the midwives concerned. Results: Home birth was attempted in 13 of the 15 cases. Significant (often multiple) antenatal risk factors were identified in 13 cases, including twin pregnancy, planned vaginal births after cesarean section, breech presentations, and maternal illness. Several women had declined some or all routine antenatal screening. Three deaths occurred before labor onset. Postmortem results were known in only four cases; many causes of death remained unexplained. Professional consensus was that seven deaths were unpreventable; elective cesarean section may have changed the outcome in eight cases. However, the pregnant women had declined this option; some were reported to be avoiding National Health Service care because of previous bad experiences. Transfer to hospital care, when it occurred, was often problematic. Care management was judged to be clinically acceptable within the parameters set by the mothers’ choices. Conclusions: Information about clinical processes (and outcomes) is essential if informed decisions are to be made. The women in this review had reportedly accepted the potential consequences of their high-risk situations. If reality is to match rhetoric about 'patient' autonomy, such decision making in high-risk situations must be accepted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Primary postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity internationally. Research comparing physiological (expectant) and active management of the third stage of labor favors active management, although studies to date have focused on childbirth within hospital settings, and the skill levels of birth attendants in facilitating physiological third stage of labor have been questioned. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of place of birth on the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and the effect of mode of management of the third stage of labor on severe postpartum hemorrhage. Methods: Data for 16,210 low-risk women giving birth in 2006 and 2007 were extracted from the New Zealand College of Midwives research database. Modes of third stage management and volume of blood lost were compared with results adjusted for age, parity, ethnicity, smoking, length of labor, mode of birth, episiotomy, perineal trauma, and newborn birthweight greater than 4,000 g. Results: In total, 1.32 percent of this low-risk cohort experienced an estimated blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. Place of birth was not found to be associated with risk of blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. More women experienced blood loss greater than 1,000 mL in the active management of labor group for all planned birth places. In this low-risk cohort, those women receiving active management of third stage of labor had a twofold risk (RR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.39–3.22) of losing more than 1,000 mL blood compared with those expelling their placenta physiologically. Conclusions: Planned place of birth does not influence the risk of blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. In this low-risk group active management of labor was associated with a twofold increase in blood loss greater than 1,000 mL compared with physiological management.

        <ab>Background: Multi-center trials enable the recruitment of larger study samples, although results might be influenced by site-specific factors. Methods: Site differences of a multicenter prospective double-blind, double-dummy randomized controlled trial (7 centers: Central Europe (Vienna)/USA (3 urban/3 rural centers)) comparing safety and efficacy of methadone and buprenorphine in pregnant opioid-dependent women and their neonates. Results: Urban US women had the highest rate of concomitant opioid (p = 0.050) and cocaine consumption (p = 0.003), the highest dropout rate (p = 0.001), and received the lowest voucher sums (p = 0.001). Viennese neonates had significantly higher Apgar scores 1 min (p = 0.001) and 5 min after birth (p &lt; 0.001) and were more often born by cesarean section (p = 0.024). Rural US newborns had a significantly shorter neonatal abstinence syndrome treatment duration compared to Viennese and urban US sites (p = 0.006), in addition to other site-specific differences, suggesting a more severely affected group of women in the urban US sites. Conclusion: This clinical trial represents a role model for pharmacological treatment in this unique sample of pregnant women and demonstrates the clinical importance of considering site-specific factors in research and clinical practice.

        <ab>In 2009, the Institute of Medicine (lOM) revised their pregnancy weight gain guidelines, recommending gestational weight gain of 11 -20 pounds for women with prepregnancy BMI &gt; 30 kg/m² We investigated the potential influence of the new guidelines on perinatal outcomes using a retrospective analysis (n = 691), comparing obese women who gained weight during pregnancy according to the new guidelines to those who gained weight according to traditional recommendations (25-35 pounds). We found no statistical difference between the two weight gain groups in infant birth weight, cesarean delivery rate, pregnancy-related hypertension, low birth weight infants, macrosomia, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, or total nursery days. Despite showing no evidence of other benefits, our data suggest that obese women who gain weight according to new lOM guidelines are no more likely to have low birth weight infants. In the absence of national consensus on appropriate gestational weight gain guidelines, our data provide useful data for clinicians when providing evidence-based weight gain goals for their obese patients.

        <ab>Objective: We compared neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months' corrected age of infants born with extremely low birth weight at an estimated gestational age of &lt;25 weeks during 2 periods: 1999–2001 (epoch 1) and 2002–2004 (epoch 2). Patients and Methods: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. Perinatal and neonatal variables and outcomes were compared between epochs. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months' corrected age were evaluated with neurologic exams and Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. Logistic regression analyses determined the independent risk of epoch for adverse outcomes. Results: Infant survival was similar between epochs (epoch 1, 35.4%, vs epoch 2, 32.3%; P = .09). A total of 411 of 452 surviving infants in epoch 1 and 405 of 438 surviving infants in epoch 2 were evaluated at 18 to 22 months' corrected age. Cesarean delivery (P = .03), surgery for patent ductus arteriosus (P = .004), and late sepsis (P = .01) were more common in epoch 2, but postnatal steroid use was dramatically reduced (63.5% vs 32.8%; P &lt; .0001). Adverse outcomes at 18 to 22 months' corrected age were common in both epochs. Moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 11.1% of surviving infants in epoch 1 and 14.9% in epoch 2 (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.52 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86–2.71]; P = .15), the Mental Developmental Index was &lt;70 in 44.9% in epoch 1 and 51% in epoch 2 (OR: 1.30 [95% CI: 0.91–1.87]; P = .15), and neurodevelopmental impairment was diagnosed in 50.1% of surviving infants in epoch 1 and 58.7% in epoch 2 (OR: 1.4 [95% CI: 0.98–2.04]; P = .07). Conclusions: Early-childhood outcomes for infants born at &lt;25 weeks' estimated gestational age were unchanged between the 2 periods.

        <ab>Background: Opting for a home birth or requesting a cesarean section in a culture where vaginal birth in a hospital is the norm challenges the health care system. The aim of this study was to compare background characteristics of women who chose these very different birth methods and to see how these choices affected factors of care and the birth experience. Methods: This descriptive study employed a secondary data analysis of a sample of women who gave birth from 1997 to 2008, including 671 women who had a planned home birth and 126 women who had a planned cesarean section based on maternal request. Data were collected by means of questionnaires. Logistic regression with crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with a 95 percent confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated. Results: Women with a planned home birth had a higher level of education (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.5–3.6), were less likely to have a high body mass index (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.01–0.6), and were less likely to be smokers (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1–0.4) when compared with women who had planned cesarean sections. When adjusted for background variables, women with a planned home birth felt less threat to the baby’s life during birth (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.03–0.4), and were more satisfied with their participation in decision making (OR: 6.0; 95% CI: 3.3–10.7) and the support from their midwife (OR 3.9; 95% CI: 2.2–7.0). They also felt more in control (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.6–6.6), had a more positive birth experience (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.7–5.0), and were more satisfied with intrapartum care (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3–4.1) compared with women who had a planned cesarean section on maternal request. Conclusions: Women who planned a home birth and women who had a cesarean section based on maternal request are significantly different groups of mothers in terms of sociodemographic background. In a birth context that promotes neither home birth nor cesarean section without medical reasons, we found that those women who had a planned home birth felt more involvement in decision making and had a more positive birth experience than those who had a requested, planned cesarean section.

        <ab>Medical professionals and public are concerned about the complications of pregnancy and delivery in women with epilepsy (WWE). Purpose: Our aim was to prospectively ascertain occurrence of these complications in a cohort of WWE enrolled in a pregnancy registry. Methods: All complications during pregnancy, delivery and first 48 h of postpartum period were recorded according to the registry protocol. This data were compared with similar statistics (for women without epilepsy) from a large teaching hospital. Results: Between April 1998 and March 2005, there were 643 completed pregnancies in this registry. (Mean age 25.7 ± 4.43 years; generalized epilepsy 46%; localization related epilepsy 54%; primigravida 53%.) Their complications are compared with those of 18,272 pregnancies managed in the teaching hospital (in parentheses). Spontaneous abortions 4.2% (2.38%); medical termination of pregnancies 2.64% (7.71%); anemia 0.62% (0.22%); gestational diabetes 1.56% (3.09%); pregnancy induced hypertension 3.89% (6.45%); antepartum hemorrhage 0.93% (1.64%); preterm labor 1.87% (6.12%); obstructed labor 0.62% (3%); cesarean section 33.4% (29.5%); assisted delivery 2.8% (2.68%); postpartum hemorrhage 0.31% (0.64%); peripartum seizures 1.4% (0.04%); intrauterine death 1.56% (2.2%); fibroid uterus or ovarian cyst 2.33% (0.53%); other medical illness 2.5% (2.15%); TORCH infection 0.31% (0.01%); birth weight &lt;2.0 kg 4.19% (7.66%). Conclusions: There was no significant increase in the risk of complications of pregnancy or delivery except for spontaneous abortions, anemia, ovarian cyst, fibroid uterus, and seizures in the peripartum period which were more frequent in WWE. Frequency of cesarean section is not increased in WWE. There is no undue risk to pregnancy and childbirth in most WWE. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 36(3) of Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (see record [rid]2016-08786-007[/rid]). In the original article, the authors omitted the following reference: Bener A, Burgut FT, Ghuloum S, Sheikh J. A study of postpartum depression in a fast developing country: prevalence and related factors. Int J Psychiat Med 2012;43:325–337.] Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p = 0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.

        <ab>Purpose: To explore and compare associations among demographics, childbirth-related stressors, depressive symptoms, gestational age, and psychological birth trauma (PBT) among adolescents. Study Design and Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive, comparative study compared two groups of adolescents for PBT. From a larger study dataset, we identified all adolescents delivering prior to 38 weeks (n = 30) and randomly selected 30 adolescents delivering between 38 and 42 weeks gestation for comparison. PBT was defined via birth appraisal, assessed by a one-item rating scale, and trauma impact, assessed via the Impact of Event Scale. Surveys, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, were completed within 72 hours of birth. We used frequencies and percentages to describe the sample and Chi square, Spearman Rank-Order Correlation, and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation to determine relationships between variables. Chi square and ANOVA statistical tests determined group differences. Results: Adolescents were primarily Latina, single, primigravidas, and over 16 years of age. Adolescents delivering before 38 weeks experiencing cesarean births reported symptoms of depression and were highest risk for PBT. Additionally adolescents delivering before 38 weeks reported lack of pain control and unsupportive caregivers in labor.Clinical Implications: Healthcare professionals cognizant of the potential risk factors for PBT can help vulnerable adolescents through caregiver support, adequate pain control in labor, education, and screening and treatment of depressive symptoms. Follow-up postdischarge, especially for high-risk adolescents, should be arranged to monitor for continued, delayed, or remitting symptoms of depression and PBT.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the role of the labor and delivery nurse in a nurse-managed practice model and nurses’ perceived ability to influence decisions about mode of delivery and outcomes. Design: Cross-sectional, descriptive, qualitative study. Setting: One nurse-managed labor and delivery unit in a community-based hospital near a major metropolitan area. Participants: A purposeful sample of 13 registered nurses with intrapartum experience. Methods: Qualitative, in-depth interview data were subjected to content analysis. Results: Experienced labor and delivery nurses perceived their role to be influential in decisions about mode of delivery. Negotiating for more time was integral to the way nurses exerted their influence, allowing for the time needed to implement practices that promote vaginal delivery. Knowledge of labor and physician practice patterns shaped the specific communication strategies used by nurses in their roles as negotiators. Conclusions: The responses of experienced, intrapartum nurses to actual and perceived time pressures and the subsequent impact on nurse–physician communication patterns and delivery mode outcomes are significant. Findings indicate the need to further explore how individual nursing practice may function as an independent predictor of delivery mode and how shared decision making among physicians, laboring women, and nurses affects rates of cesarean delivery.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate the prevalence of childbirth-related fear from pregnancy to one year after childbirth and to identify factors associated with being cured of childbirth-related fear. Design: A longitudinal regional survey. Setting: Three hospitals in a northern part of Sweden. Participants: Six hundred ninety-seven (697) women who completed four questionnaires. Methods: Data were collected by questionnaires in mid and late pregnancy and at 2 months and one year after birth. Childbirth related fear was measured 3 times. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in childbirth fear from 12.4% in mid-pregnancy to 15.1% one year after childbirth (p &lt; .001). Women who were cured of childbirth fear reported a better birth experience and would prefer a vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy. These women were also more likely to experience a feeling of control during birth and were more satisfied with information about the progress of labor, but there was no difference in prenatal counseling or having an elective cesarean between the groups. Conclusion: Women with prenatal fear of childbirth may be cured of this fear by having a better birth experience. If women feel in control of their bodies and are well informed about the progress of labor, the chances of being cured will increase. Prenatal counseling or having an elective cesarean birth does not seem to be a solution for relieving childbirth fear. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To test whether demographic characteristics predict registered nurses’ attitudes toward birth practices. Design: A secondary analysis of a cross‐sectional survey, the National Maternity Care Attitudes Survey. Setting: A national survey conducted with health care providers providing maternity care in Canada. Participants: A convenience sample of 545 registered nurses. Methods: Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine three hypotheses about nurses’ demographic differences in relationship to their attitudes toward birth practices. Attitude scales included acceptability of doulas, effects of routine electronic fetal monitoring, factors decreasing cesarean birth rates, the importance of vaginal birth for women, safety of birth, episiotomy, and epidural analgesia. Results: Tertiary hospital–level of employment was associated with more positive attitudes toward epidural analgesia and less positive attitudes toward the importance of vaginal birth. Nurses working at a tertiary hospital were more likely to select an obstetrician for their own maternity care. Those who worked at a community hospital were more likely to select a family physician. Nurses’ selection of an obstetrician was associated with less positive attitudes toward the safety of birth and importance of vaginal birth and more positive attitudes toward electronic fetal monitoring, episiotomy, and epidural analgesia. Conclusion: Nurses’ attitudes may be influenced by exposure in their workplaces to predominant care providers’ birth practices. Research examining the relationships between nurses’ workplace exposures, attitudes, and practice behaviors is needed to develop understanding about how nurses contribute to rates of intervention in maternity care.

        <ab>Postpartum negative mood interferes with maternal–infant bonding and carries long-term negative consequences for infant growth. We examined the effects of birth-related risks on mother’s postpartum anxiety and depression. A community cohort of 1,844 low-risk women who delivered a singleton term baby completed measures assessing delivery, emotions during labor, attitudes toward pregnancy and infant, mood regulation, and postpartum anxiety and depression. Under conditions of low risk, 20.5% of parturient women reported high levels of depressive symptoms. Following Cesarean Section Delivery (CSD), 23% reported high depressive symptoms, compared to 19% following Vaginal Delivery (VGD), and 21% after Assisted Vaginal Delivery (AVGD). State anxiety was highest in CSD and lowest in VGD. Mothers undergoing CSD experienced labor as most negative, reported highest somatic symptoms during the last trimester, and were least efficient in regulating negative mood. Postpartum depression was independently associated with higher maternal age, CSD, labor pain, lower negative and higher positive emotions during labor, inefficient mood regulation, somatic symptoms, and more negative and less positive perception of fetus during last trimester. Results demonstrate that elevated depressive symptoms are prevalent in the postpartum even under optimal socioeconomic and health conditions and increase following CSD. Interventions to increase positive infant-related perceptions and emotions may be especially important for promoting bond formation following CSD.

        <ab>Objective: To assess pregnancy and fetal outcomes after in utero exposure to interferon-β (IFNβ) in all pregnancies occurring in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) during the study period, with a specific focus on the risk of spontaneous abortion. Methods: In this cohort study, data were gathered through a standardized, semi-structured interview. Patients who discontinued IFNβ less than 4 weeks from conception (exposed) were compared with those who had discontinued the drug at least 4 weeks from conception or who were never treated (not exposed). Possible confounders were handled through multivariate analyses adjusted for propensity score (PS). Results: We collected data on 396 pregnancies in 388 women, 88 classified as exposed (mean exposure 4.6±5.8 weeks). IFNβ exposure was not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (PS-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4 to 2.9, p=0.88), although it was associated with both lower baby weight (PS-adjusted β−113.8, p&lt;0.0001) and length (PS-adjusted β −1.102, p&lt;0.0001). Proportion of spontaneous abortion in exposed patients fell within the range expected for the Italian population in the same period. IFNβ exposure (PS-adjusted OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.78, p=0.012) and cesarean delivery were the only predictors of preterm delivery. In the exposed group, we did not observe any significant fetal complications, malformations, or developmental abnormalities over a median follow-up of 2.1 years. Conclusions: Our findings point to the relative safety of IFNβ exposure times of up to 4 weeks and can assist neurologists facing therapeutic decisions in women with MS with a pregnancy plan.

        <ab>Background: Attitudes drive practice, perhaps more than evidence. The objective of this study was to determine if the new generation of Canadian obstetricians has attitudes differing from those of their predecessors. Methods: Employing a cross‐sectional, Internet, and paper‐based survey, we conducted an in‐depth study of obstetricians responding to the Canadian National Maternity Care Attitudes Survey. Results: Of the 800 Canadian obstetricians providing intrapartum care, 549 (68.6%) responded. Participants were stratified by age less than or equal to 40 years compared with those over 40 years; 81 percent of those 40 years or younger were women versus 40 percent over 40 years of age. Younger obstetricians were significantly more likely to favor use of routine epidural analgesia and believed that it did not interfere with labor or lead to instrumentation; were more concerned and feared the perineal and pelvic floor consequences of vaginal birth compared with cesarean section; and were significantly less supportive of vaginal birth after prior cesarean section, home birth, birth plans, routine episiotomy, and routine electronic fetal monitoring as providing maternal or fetal benefits. They were less positive than the older generation about a range of approaches to reducing the cesarean section rate, the importance of maternal choice and role in their own birth, and peer review, and they were more likely to believe that women having a cesarean section were not missing an important experience. No significant generational differences were found for ambivalent attitudes to vaginal breech birth. Conclusions: Younger obstetricians were more evidence‐based for some issues and less for others. In general younger obstetricians were more supportive of the role of birth technology in normal birth, including routine epidural analgesia, and they were less appreciative of the role of women in their own birth. They saw cesarean section as a solution to many perceived labor and birth problems. Results suggest a need to examine how obstetricians acquire their favorable attitudes to birth technology in normal birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: To assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth in homelike versus hospital settings and to determine risk factors for the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Methods: Multi-center cross-sectional study at midwifery practices, general hospitals and a tertiary (university) referral center. An unselected population of 907 women was invited to complete questionnaires on PTSD, demographic, psychosocial, and obstetric characteristics 2 to 6 months after delivery. Prevalence of PTSD was based on women who met all criteria of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), whereas risk factors were determined using the severity (sum-score) of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Results: PTSD following childbirth was found in 1.2% of the respondents (5/428 women, response rate 47%), while 9.1% of women (39/428) had experienced the delivery as traumatic. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with unplanned cesarean section, low sense of coherence (coping skills), and high intensity of pain. Initial differences in posttraumatic stress symptoms between home and hospital deliveries disappeared after taking into account the (by definition) uncomplicated nature of home births. Conclusion: In this Dutch study, 1 in 100 women had PTSD following childbirth, with no differences between home- and hospital deliveries after controlling for complications and interventions. Emergency cesarean section, severe labor pain, and poor coping skills were associated with more posttraumatic stress symptoms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: A woman's refusal or request for a cesarean section can be a problem for midwives and obstetricians working in maternity units. The objective of this study was to describe the attitudes of midwives in Sweden toward the obstetrician's decision making in relation to a woman's refusal of an emergency cesarean section and to a woman’s request for a cesarean section without a medical indication. Methods: The study has a cross‐sectional multicenter design and used an anonymous, structured, and standardized questionnaire for data collection. The study group comprised midwives who had experience working at a delivery ward at 13 maternity units with neonatal intensive care units in Sweden (n = 259). Results: In the case of a woman’s refusal to undergo an emergency cesarean section for fetal reasons, most midwives (89%) thought that the obstetrician should try to persuade the woman to agree. Concerning a woman’s request for a cesarean section without any medical indications, most midwives thought that the obstetrician should agree if the woman had previous maternal or fetal complications. The reason was to support the woman’s decision out of respect for her autonomy; the midwives at six university hospitals were less willing to accept the woman's autonomy in this situation. If the only reason was 'her own choice,' 77 percent of the midwives responded that the obstetrician should not comply. Conclusions: The main focus of midwives seems to be the baby's health, and therefore they do not always agree with respect to a woman’s refusal or request for a cesarean section. The midwives prefer to continue to explain the situation and persuade the woman to agree with the recommendation of the obstetrician.

        <ab>Background: In Australia, birth rates for women aged 35 years or more are significant and increasing and a considerable percentage are first births. This study investigated the effect of maternal age on interventions in labor and birth for primiparous women aged 35 to 44 years compared with primiparous women aged 25 to 29 years. Methods: All primiparous women who gave birth in Victoria, Australia, in 2005 and 2006 (n = 57,426) were included in this population‐based cross‐sectional study. Women were stratified by admission status (private/public). Main outcome measures were induction of labor, augmentation of labor, use of epidural analgesia, and method of birth. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between maternal age and cesarean adjusted for confounders. Results: Older women were more likely to give birth by cesarean section whether admitted as public or private patients. For private patients, total cesarean rates were 31.8 percent (25–29 yr), 46.0 percent (35–39 yr), and 60.0 percent (40–44 yr; p &lt; 0.001) compared with 27.5, 41.6, and 53.4 percent for public patients (p &lt; 0.001). Older women who experienced labor were more likely to have an instrumental vaginal birth or an emergency cesarean section than younger women. Both were more common in women admitted as private patients. Age‐related trends were also seen for induction of labor and use of epidural analgesia. Rates were higher for private patients. Rates of induction were (37.8, 40.2, and 42.5%) for private patients compared with (32.1, 36.7, and 40.1%) for public patients and rates for epidural were (45.3, 49.9, and 48.1%) among private patients compared with (33.3, 38.8, and 39.3%) among public patients. Conclusions: Interventions in labor and birth increased with maternal age, and this effect was seen particularly for cesarean section among women admitted privately. These findings were not fully explained by the complications we considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: To evaluate a perinatal team's clinical responses to the key components of the failure to rescue process. Methods: This retrospective descriptive study involved a review of medical records and their accompanying fetal monitoring strips for 53 women who had a cesarean birth at term for a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. The instrument was the Fetal Safety Failure to Rescue Process Tool based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Failure to Rescue Patient Safety Indicator adapted for perinatal care processes. This tool measured four process measures: careful surveillance, timely identification of complications, appropriate interventions, and activating a team response. A mean total score was computed to determine quality of care based on all four of the process measures. Results: The perinatal team's mean total score was 6.6 (SD = 1.0, range 3-8); the highest possible score was 8. The lowest score was found in the team's response with appropriate interventions (lateral positioning, intravenous fluid bolus, discontinuation of oxytocin, oxygen administration, amnioinfusion, administration of Terbutaline) based on fetal heart rate pattern. Interrater reliability of the tool was 90%. Clinical Implications: This study provided information that may be useful in evaluating processes of care to ensure quality care for mothers and babies during labor. The findings formed the basis for implementing unit-specific educational programs, including (a) certification, continuing education, and documented competence in electronic fetal monitoring education to promote consistency in language and understanding of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns; (b) review of appropriate documentation of nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns; (c) review and revision, if necessary, of established institutional standards and guidelines for appropriate interventions for nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns; (d) changes in standardized forms to include times for notification of team members and improved communication, and (e) mechanisms for identifying system failures.

        <ab>The objective of the present study was to investigate factors associated with cesarean sections in two cities located in different regions of Brazil and to determine factors that explain the higher cesarean section rate in the more developed city, Ribeirão Preto, compared to the less developed one, São Luís. Data from two cohort studies comprising 2846 women in Ribeirão Preto in 1994, and 2443 women in São Luís in 1997/1998 were used. Adjusted and non-adjusted risk estimates were calculated using a Poisson regression model. The cesarean section rate was 33.7% in São Luís and 50.8% in Ribeirão Preto. Adjusted analysis in a joint sequential model revealed a 51% higher risk of cesarean section in Ribeirão Preto compared to São Luís (prevalence rate ratio (PRR) = 1.51). Adjustment for category of hospital admission reduced the PRR to 1.09, i.e., this variable explained 82% of the difference in the cesarean section rate between the two cities. Adjustment for the variable 'the same physician for prenatal care and delivery' reduced the PRR to 1.07, with the 'physician' factor explaining 86% of the difference between rates. When simultaneously adjusted for the two variables, the PRR decreased to 1.05, with these two variables explaining 90% of the difference in the cesarean section rate between the two cities, and the difference was no longer significant. The difference in the cesarean section rate between the two Brazilian cities, one more and one less developed, was mainly explained by the physician factor and, to a lesser extent, by the category of hospital admission.

        <ab>Background: The question 'will you be delivering my baby?' is one that pregnant women frequently ask their physicians. We sought to determine whether obstetric outcomes differed between women whose babies were delivered by their own obstetrician (regular-care obstetrician) and those attended by an on-call obstetrician who did not provide antenatal care. Methods: We performed a cohort study of all live singleton term births between 1991 and 2001 at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montréal. We excluded breech deliveries, elective cesarean sections and deliveries with placenta previa or prolapse of the umbilical cord. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare obstetric outcomes (e.g., cesarean delivery, instrumental vaginal delivery and episiotomy) between the regular-care and on-call obstetricians after adjustment for potential confounders. Results: A total of 28 332 eligible deliveries were attended by 26 obstetricians: 21 779 (76.9%) by the patient’s own obstetrician and 6553 (23.1%) by the on-call obstetrician. Compared with women attended by their regular-care obstetrician, those attended by an on-call obstetrician had higher rates of cesarean delivery (11.9% v. 11.4%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.24, p &lt; 0.01) and of third- or fourth-degree tears (7.9% v. 6.4%, adjusted OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07–1.36, p &lt; 0.01) but lower rates of episiotomy (38.5% v. 42.9%, OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72–0.82, p &lt; 0.001). No differences were observed between the groups in the rate of instrumental vaginal delivery. The increase in the overall rate of cesarean delivery among women attended by an on-call obstetrician was due mainly to an increase in cesarean deliveries during the first stage of labor because of non reassuring fetal heart tracing (2.9% v. 1.7%, adjusted OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.49–2.15, p &lt; 0.001). The time of day of delivery did not modify the observed effects. Interpretation: The type of attending obstetrician (regular care v. on call) had a minor effect on obstetric outcomes.

        <ab>This prospective study assessed the relation between pain catastrophizing, response to experimental pain stimuli, and pain perceived by women after elective cesarean sections. Forty-seven women who were scheduled for elective cesarean section were enrolled in the study. Magnitude estimation to suprathreshold phasic and tonic heat pain stimuli was assessed 1 or 2 days before surgery. Women completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale after the heat stimuli and again on the first postoperative day. During the first and second postoperative days, perception of pain intensity was assessed by visual analog scale at each analgesia request. A multiple regression analysis revealed that pain on the first postoperative day was predicted by patient response to preoperative tonic heat stimuli (r² = .167, P = .008). Pain on the second postoperative day was predicted by preoperative pain catastrophizing (r² = .139, P = .021). No significant association was observed between preoperative response to heat stimuli or pain catastrophizing and the patient's analgesic consumption in the obstetrical ward. It is concluded that pain catastrophizing and response to experimental tonic heat pain correlate with post-cesarean section pain. Perspective: This article presents psychological and psychophysical measures that may be of help in the prediction of post-cesarean section pain. It may therefore contribute to the treatment of the sequelae of the most common major surgical procedure performed in women in their reproductive years.

        <ab>Background: In a trend similar to continuous electronic fetal monitoring, many hospitals are incorporating central fetal monitoring into labor and delivery suites. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the use of central fetal monitoring had an effect on neonatal outcomes or cesarean section rate. Methods: This retrospective study involved patient data from deliveries occurring at Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, between the years 2000 and 2003. In the period from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2001, central fetal monitoring was available, whereas in the period from February 1, 2002, to December 31, 2003, it was unavailable. Data on deliveries at Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo were obtained using the Western New York Perinatal Data System, which is an electronic data set based on birth certificate information. The method of delivery, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and 5-minute Apgar scores less than 7 were compared for deliveries occurring with and without the use of central fetal monitoring. These outcomes were further subdivided into full-term and preterm deliveries. Results: Three thousand five hundred and twelve deliveries used central monitoring and 3,007 deliveries did not. For full-term deliveries, in the years with central fetal monitoring compared with the years without it, no differences in the cesarean section rate (13.4 vs 14.5%, not significant [NS]), the admission rate in neonatal intensive care unit (3.3 vs 3.3%, NS), or the incidence of Apgar score less than 7 (0.6 vs 0.5%, NS) were observed. For preterm deliveries, comparing the years with central fetal monitoring with the years without, no differences in the cesarean section rate (21.3 vs 21.3%, NS), the admission rate in neonatal intensive care unit (17.7 vs 20.1%, NS), or the incidence of Apgar score less than 7 (7.0 vs 6.5%, NS) were observed. Analyses pooling all deliveries also failed to show any differences in any of the parameters. Conclusions: No statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the rates of cesarean section, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, or incidence of Apgar scores of less than 7 associated with the use of central fetal monitoring. Therefore, we could not identify any benefit to the use of central fetal heart rate monitoring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this cross-sectional correlational study was to investigate the prevalence of symptoms and psychosocial predictors of postpartum depression (PPD) among Arabic Muslim Jordanian women serving in the military. Jordanian active-duty military women who had given birth within the last year (n = 300) and were working in 4 military hospitals participated in the study. Tools used included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Impact of Event Scale–Revised, and the Multidimensional Perception of Social Support. Sixty-seven percent of study participants had mild to moderate symptoms of PPD, and 16% had high levels of symptoms of PPD. Seventy-five percent reported having adequate social support, and 75% reported perceived stress above the cutoff score. There was a strong positive significant relationship between symptoms of PPD and perceptions of stress. There was a significant moderate negative relationship between symptoms of PPD and perception of social support. Income, intendedness of pregnancy, mode of birth, family social support, and perception of stress were the strongest predictors of PPD. There was a reciprocal relationship between PPD and psychosocial variables, with women having low levels of perceived stress and satisfaction with social support having fewer symptoms of postpartum. These findings demonstrate the need to address the psychosocial needs of Arabic Muslim Jordanian childbearing women serving in the military through comprehensive interventions. Findings highlight the importance of social support in decreasing perceived stress and symptoms of PPD in these women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Background: Midwives in Ontario, Canada, provide care in the home and hospital and are required to submit data for all births to the Ontario Ministry of Health database. The purpose of this study was to compare maternal and perinatal/neonatal mortality and morbidity and intrapartum intervention rates for women attended by Ontario midwives who planned a home birth compared with similar low-risk women who planned a hospital birth between 2003 and 2006. Methods: The database provided outcomes for all women planning a home birth at the onset of labor (n = 6, 692) and for a cohort, stratified by parity, of similar low-risk women planning a hospital birth. Results: The rate of perinatal and neonatal mortality was very low (1/1,000) for both groups, and no difference was shown between groups in perinatal and neonatal mortality or serious morbidity (2.4% vs 2.8%; relative risk [RR], 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.84 [0.68–1.03]). No maternal deaths were reported. All measures of serious maternal morbidity were lower in the planned home birth group as were rates for all interventions including cesarean section (5.2% vs 8.1%; RR [95% CI]: 0.64 [0.56, 0.73]). Nulliparas were less likely to deliver at home, and had higher rates of ambulance transport from home to hospital than multiparas planning home birth and had rates of intervention and outcomes similar to, or lower than, nulliparas planning hospital births. Conclusions: Midwives who were integrated into the health care system with good access to emergency services, consultation, and transfer of care provided care resulting in favorable outcomes for women planning both home or hospital births.

        <ab>Background: Approximately 1 in 10 women suffers from depression during pregnancy. Little is known about whether antepartum depression affects a mother's length of stay at delivery. We aimed to compare peripartum length of stay in women with and without depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Methods: This study involved secondary data analysis of a larger study exploring antepartum depression. Each subject completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). We used bivariate analyses to compare patient characteristics of women with and without an elevated CES-D, and we used a multivariate Poisson regression to evaluate predictors of length of stay. Results: The study sample included 867 pregnant women. Overall, 18% of study subjects scored ≥16 on the CES-D. In bivariate analyses, a longer stay was associated with an elevated CES-D and minority race, antepartum complications, cesarean delivery, prematurity, multiple gestation, and neonatal length of stay. In the final multivariate model adjusting for sociodemographic, antepartum, and obstetric factors, an elevated CES-D was associated with a significantly longer peripartum stay (0.26 days, CI 0.04-0.48). Conclusions: Depressive symptoms during pregnancy predict an increase in peripartum length of stay. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: We explored the impact of eating disorders on birth outcomes in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Method: Of 35,929 pregnant women, 35 reported broad anorexia nervosa (AN), 304 bulimia nervosa (BN), 1,812 binge eating disorder (BED), and 36 EDNOS purging type (EDNOS-P) in the six months before or during pregnancy. The referent comprised 33,742 women with no eating disorder. Results: Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was lower in AN and higher in BED than the referent. AN, BN, and BED mothers reported greater gestational weight gain, and smoking was elevated in all eating disorder groups. BED mothers had higher birth weight babies, lower risk of small for gestational age, and higher risk of large for gestational age and cesarean section than the referent. Prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain attenuated the effects. Conclusion: BED influences birth outcomes either directly or via higher maternal weight and gestational weight gain. The absence of differences in AN and EDNOS-P may reflect small numbers and lesser severity in population samples. Adequate gestational weight gain in AN may mitigate against adverse birth outcomes. Detecting eating disorders in pregnancy could identify modifiable factors (e.g., high gestational weight gain, binge eating, and smoking) that influence birth outcomes.

        <ab>[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 14(6) of Maternal and Child Health Journal (see record [rid]2010-22218-020[/rid]). There were errors in the original article and the corrections consequent on the use of 'row' rather than 'column' percentages in the formula Pe (OR — 1)/OR as stated under the statistical methods. Further corrections are given in the erratum.] Adverse birth outcomes remain significant contributors to perinatal mortality as well as developmental disabilities worldwide but limited evidence exists in sub-Saharan Africa based on a conceptual framework incorporating neighborhood context. This study therefore set out to determine the prevalence and risk factors for preterm births and low birthweight in an urban setting from this region. A cross-sectional study of all live births from May 2005 to December 2007 in an inner-city maternity hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. Factors predictive of preterm births and low birthweight were determined by unconditional multivariable logistic regression within a conceptual framework for adverse birth outcomes. Population attributable risk (PAR%) for each factor was also determined. Of the 4,314 newborns enrolled, 859 (19.9%) were preterm and 440 (10.2%) were low birthweight. One-third of mothers received no antenatal care while about 6% had HIV and another 6% had a history of hypertensive disorders. About 43% of the low birthweight infants were born full term. Maternal predictors of preterm delivery and/or low birthweight were marital status, occupation, residential accommodation with shared sanitation facilities, lack of antenatal care, absence of previous cesarean section, hypertensive disorders and antepartum hemorrhage. Gender and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were also predictive of low birthweight. IUGR (PAR = 48.74%) and lack of prior cesarean section (PAR = 41.99%) were the leading contributors to preterm birth and/or low birthweight. The burden of preterm and low birthweight deliveries in this setting is associated with modifiable individual and neighborhood-level risk factors that warrant community-oriented public health interventions.

        <ab>Aim: To investigate differences between the infants born in occipital and breech presentation relative to the passive and active motility. Method: A prospective study was conducted in the period from 2006 to 2007 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Novi Sad. Subjects were 50 breech-presenting and 87 occipital-presenting term newborns delivered by elective cesarean section following a regular course of pregnancy, without fetal, newborn, and the pregnant female disease. Outcome measures were popliteal angle; extension of the hip-joint; ventral flexion and dorsal extension in the axis; spontaneous displacement; crawling reflex; righting reaction in vertical and sitting positions; righting reaction in horizontal suspension, the automatic walking investigated on the second and fourth day of life. Results: Except for righting reaction in horizontal suspension, the newborns from breech presentation had a significantly lower score for all investigated parameters of active movements at the first and second examination. There was no difference between occipital and breech-group relative to the ventral flexion and dorsal extension in the axis. The popliteal angle was significantly increased, whereas the extension in the hip joint was significantly decreased in the breech group. Conclusions: Investigations showed a significantly decreased expression of active movements in the breech group, which cannot be explained only by postural deformities.

        <ab>Background: Recent evidence suggests higher prevalence of autistic disorder in association with certain prenatal and perinatal factors or adversities. Objectives: 1) to investigate the relationship between autistic disorders and certain prenatal and perinatal conditions, and 2) to identify possible risk factors which could be preventable. Patients and Method: A case-control study of fifty autistic children and fifty non-autistic children, who presented with speech delay to the Psychiatric Research unit at Mosul Medical College and to pediatric outpatient clinic during the period between 10th May 2011 to 10th April 2012. Detailed prenatal and perinatal history was taken from the parents of each patient and control group. Statistical tests were used to calculate Odd ratio, 95% Confidence interval, and p-value. Results: The autistic group was predominantly male. M: F ratio3.5:1. Urban people accounted for 96% of the sample. Six prenatal and perinatal risk factors were identified. These were: advanced maternal age (p=0.000), advanced paternal age (p=0.004), delivery by cesarean section (p=0.02), neonatal asphyxia (p=0.000), neonatal convulsions (p=0.03), and history of previous admission to neonatal intensive care unit (p=0.001). Conclusion and recommendations: The study confirms the presences of some prenatal and perinatal risk factors are associated with autistic disorders. The investigators hope that a better ante-natal, obstetric, and neonatal care may play an important role in protection from this disorder in a significant number of children.

        <ab>Adequate prenatal care provides an opportunity for counseling and reducing the complications associated with pregnancy and delivery. Our objective was to describe the demographic, behavioral, and clinical profile of the pregnant women hospitalized at public maternity hospitals and to identify factors associated with six or more prenatal consultations in Vitória, Brazil. A cross-sectional study of 1,380 women was conducted in public maternity hospitals in Vitória, Brazil. Sixty-seven percent of participants had ≥ 6 prenatal consultations. Reasons for hospitalization were vaginal delivery (55.7%), cesarean section (32.9%), clinical treatment (7.7%), and abortion/miscarriage (3.7%). Having 9 years of schooling (odds ratio, OR = 1.8; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.1–3.1), being married (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2–2.9) and delivering at term (OR = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.6–8.2) were significantly independently associated with having ≥ 6 prenatal consultations. Although higher education, being married, and delivering at term were associated with ≥ 6 prenatal consultations in this population, the high rate of Cesarean sections demonstrates the need for ongoing educative strategies among health professionals.

        <ab>Objectives: In the United States, significant ethnic and racial health and healthcare disparities exist among our most vulnerable populations, new mothers and newborns. We sought to determine disparities in socioeconomic status, perinatal health, and perinatal healthcare for black mothers and their newborns cared for in well-baby nurseries compared with white mother/baby pairs in Pennsylvania. Methods: A retrospective analysis of a merged data set containing birth and clinical discharge records was conducted. Perinatal data from 44,105 black mothers and their singleton newborns, ≥35 weeks gestational age cared for in Pennsylvania well-baby nurseries from 1998-2002 were compared with 88,210 white mother/baby pairs. Results: Black mothers were younger and were much more likely to receive Medicaid or be uninsured compared with white mothers. They were less likely to be college-educated, married, or have prenatal care beginning in the first trimester. Infants born to black mothers were less likely to be delivered via Cesarean section, but were more likely to be born between 35 and 38 weeks gestation and be of low birth weight. Conclusions: Numerous significant disparities exist for black mothers and their newborns cared for in well-baby nurseries in Pennsylvania. Since most newborns are cared for in this setting as opposed to intensive care environments, recognition of the differences that exist for this group when compared to well newborns of white mothers can help to improve healthcare and its delivery to this population. Federal and local initiatives must continue efforts to eliminate racial disparities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Context: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a postnatal drug withdrawal syndrome primarily caused by maternal opiate use. No national estimates are available for the incidence of maternal opiate use at the time of delivery or NAS. Objectives: To determine the national incidence of NAS and antepartum maternal opiate use and to characterize trends in national health care expenditures associated with NAS between 2000 and 2009. Design, Setting, and Patients: Aretrospective, serial, cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of newborns with NAS. The Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) was used to identify newborns with NAS by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify mothers using diagnosis related groups for vaginal and cesarean deliveries. Clinical conditions were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. NAS and maternal opiate use were described as an annual frequency per 1000 hospital births. Missing hospital charges (5%of cases) were estimated using multiple imputation. Trends in health care utilization outcomes over time were evaluated using variance-weighted regression. All hospital charges were adjusted for inflation to 2009 US dollars. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of NAS and maternal opiate use, and related hospital charges. Results: The separate years (2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009) of national discharge data included 2920 to 9674 unweighted discharges with NAS and 987 to 4563 unweighted discharges for mothers diagnosed with antepartum opiate use, within data sets including 784 191 to 1.1 million discharges for children (KID) and 816 554 to 879 910 discharges for all ages of delivering mothers (NIS). Between 2000 and 2009, the incidence of NAS among newborns increased from 1.20 (95% CI, 1.04-1.37) to 3.39 (95% CI, 3.12-3.67) per 1000 hospital births per year (P for trend &lt;.001). Antepartum maternal opiate use also increased from 1.19 (95% CI, 1.01-1.35) to 5.63 (95% CI, 4.40-6.71) per 1000 hospital births per year (P for trend &lt;.001). In 2009, newborns with NAS were more likely than all other hospital births to have low birth weight (19.1%; SE, 0.5%; vs 7.0%; SE, 0.2%), have respiratory complications (30.9%; SE, 0.7%; vs 8.9%; SE, 0.1%), and be covered by Medicaid (78.1%; SE, 0.8%; vs 45.5%; SE, 0.7%; all P&lt;.001). Mean hospital charges for discharges with NAS increased from $39 400 (95% CI, $33 400- $45 400) in 2000 to $53 400 (95% CI, $49 000-$57 700) in 2009 (P for trend &lt;.001). By 2009, 77.6% of charges for NAS were attributed to state Medicaid programs. Conclusion: Between 2000 and 2009, a substantial increase in the incidence of NAS and maternal opiate use in the United States was observed, as well as hospital charges related to NAS.

        <ab>Objective: To identify the clinical diagnosis rate of postpartum depression (PPD) in Asian American subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese) compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Design: Cross-sectional study using electronic health records (EHR). Setting: A large, outpatient, multiservice clinic in Northern California. Participants: A diverse clinical population of non-Hispanic White (N = 4582), Asian Indian (N = 1264), Chinese (N = 1160), Filipino (N = 347), Japanese (N = 124), Korean (N = 183), and Vietnamese (N = 147) mothers. Methods: Cases of PPD were identified from EHRs using physician diagnosis codes, medication usage, and age standardized for comparison. The relationship between PPD and other demographic variables (race/ethnicity, maternal age, delivery type, marital status, and infant gender) were examined in a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: The PPD diagnosis rate for all Asian American mothers in aggregate was significantly lower than the diagnosis rate in non-Hispanic White mothers. Moreover, of the six Asian American subgroups, PPD diagnosis rates for Asian Indian, Chinese, and Filipino mothers were significantly lower than non-Hispanic White mothers. In multivariate analyses, race/ethnicity, age, and cesarean were significant predictors of PPD. Conclusion: In this insured population, PPD diagnosis rates were lower among Asian Americans, with variability in rates across the individual Asian American subgroups. It is unclear whether these lower rates are due to underreporting, underdiagnosis, or underutilization of mental health care in this setting.

        <ab>The researchers’ aims were to estimate the prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms in Italy. Cross-sectional data from the survey, 'Health and use of health care in Italy' were analyzed. The authors focused on 5,812 women, pregnant some time during five years before the survey. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate risk factors independently associated with postpartum depressive symptoms. Evaluation of seasonal trends was also performed. In the total sample, 23.5% (n = 1,365) reported having suffered postpartum depressive symptoms: 20.7% experienced baby blues, and 2.8% postpartum depression. Factors significantly associated with baby blues were, among others, living in northern or central areas (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.88; 95%CI 1.57–2.15 and 1.40; 95%CI 1.20–1.63, respectively), history of depression (aOR 1.34; 95%CI 1.15–1.56), and attendance at antenatal classes (aOR 1.13; 95%CI 1.04–1.22). Factors significantly associated with postpartum depression were: anamnesis of depression (aOR 3.32; 95%CI 2.69–4.09), gaining more than 16 kg of weight during pregnancy (aOR 1.48; 95%CI 1.03–2.12), and undergoing a cesarean section (planned: aOR 1.56; 95%CI 1.05–2.29; unplanned: aOR 1.78; 95%CI 1.16–2.73). Multiparity was a protective factor both for baby blues (aOR 0.80; 95%CI 0.70–0.91), and postpartum depression (aOR 0.71; 95%CI 0.51–0.98). No clear seasonality was observed for postpartum depression, while for baby blues a certain aggregation of events was registered during the central months of the year. The authors’ study highlighted variables associated with baby blues and postpartum depression to target screening for women for postpartum depressive symptoms.

        <ab>To analyze cranial growth and size of anterior fontanel during the first year of life, we undertook a cohort study with a sample of 33 infants assessed at birth and reexamined at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months. Examination included assessment of head circumference, anterior fontanel size, anteroposterior distance, biauricular distance, and cephalic index. All infants were neurologically normal. Mean size of the anterior fontanel at birth was 1.77 cm² and, in disagreement with literature data, fontanel size increased up to 2 months of age; fontanel was closed at 1 year for 27.3% of infants. Significant differences in cranial anthropometry were not found in relation to method of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), gender and gestational age. Our results indicate the need to reevaluate anthropometric examination data and to establish patterns of normality, particularly for miscegenated populations that have not been widely investigated.

        <ab>Objective: To estimate the national occurrence of pregnancies in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) and epilepsy and to compare these pregnancy outcomes cross-sectionally with those in women with pregestational diabetes mellitus (DM) and the general obstetric population. Methods: We studied the 2003–2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, to estimate the number of deliveries in women with MS, epilepsy, DM, and the general obstetric population. Pregnancy outcomes included length of hospital stay, hypertensive disorders including preeclampsia (HTN), premature rupture of membranes (PROM), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and cesarean delivery. Multivariable regression analyses used maternal age and race/ethnicity as covariates. Results: Of an estimated 18.8 million deliveries, 10,055 occurred in women with MS, 4,730 with epilepsy, and 187,239 with DM. MS was associated with mildly increased odds of antenatal hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–1.5), IUGR (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2–2.4), and cesarean delivery (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.4). Similarly, epilepsy was associated with increased rates of antenatal hospitalization (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.6–3.5), IUGR (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.3), and cesarean delivery (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.9). HTN and PROM were not increased in either group. DM was associated with an increased risk of all adverse outcomes. Length of stay was modestly increased in all groups compared with controls. Conclusion: In this large national database study of pregnancy outcomes in women with multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, rates of intrauterine growth restriction and cesarean delivery were only marginally higher than the general obstetric population without increases in other adverse outcomes.

        <ab>Introduction: Postpartum depression is a significant mental health problem that occurs more frequently in the first 4 weeks postpartum and also may occur later during the first postpartum year. Women who receive in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment have a particular perinatal experience that may create postpartum mental health concerns. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate factors associated with postpartum depression in women who received IVF treatment. Methods: Sixty of 71 eligible postpartum women who were treated at an infertility treatment center and who conceived by IVF were included in this study, which used a self-administered, structured questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of postpartum depression was 25%, including mild (16.7%), moderate (6.7%), and severe (1.7%). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the frequency of receiving IVF treatment and perceived stress were positively correlated with postpartum depression, whereas family function and social support were negatively correlated with postpartum depression. Multiple regression analysis showed that the frequency of receiving IVF treatment, birth method, and social support were significant predictive factors for postpartum depression when covariates were controlled (R² 56.6%). Discussion: A higher frequency of IVF treatment, cesarean birth, and inadequate social support increase the possibility of postpartum depression, and clinicians should provide appropriate anticipatory education or counseling.

        <ab>Background: Cytokines play an important role during labor and full- or preterm delivery. They influence physical immunity of the fetus-neonate and express a leading role in the perinatal period, being present in maternal and fetal tissues. Aim: To investigate whether cytokine concentrations in the mother, fetus and neonate depend on the labor and the mode of the delivery. Study Design: Prospective study. Subjects: Seventy-eight healthy, non-smoking parturients (mean age 28±4, range 21-39 years, delivering vaginally: n=52 or by elective cesarean section: n=26) and their single, healthy, appropriate for gestational age, full-term neonates. Outcome Measures: We correlated determined circulating levels of IL-2, sIL-2R, IL-4, sIL-4R, IL-6, sIL-6R, IL-1β, IL-8, IFN-γ, TNF-α, sTNF RI, sTNF RII and RANTES in the mothers before delivery (MS), the fetuses (UC) and the neonates in days 1 (N1) and 4 (N4) of life, with the mode of delivery. RESULTS: sIL-2R in N1 and N4, sIL-4R in MS, IL-6 in MS and UC, IL-1β in MS, UC and N1, IFN-γ in MS and UC, TNF-α in UC, N1 and N4, sTNF RI in UC were significantly higher in cases of vaginal delivery than in cases of elective cesarean section (p ranging from 0.0005 to 0.05). Conclusions: Vaginal delivery promotes the production of various cytokines and their receptors, which are implicated in neonatal immunity.

        <ab>Few studies are available about racial inequalities in perinatal health in Brazil and little is known about whether the existing inequality is due to socioeconomic factors or to racial discrimination per se. Data regarding the Ribeirão Preto birth cohort, Brazil, whose mothers were interviewed from June 1, 1978 to May 31, 1979 were used to answer these questions. The perinatal factors were obtained from the birth questionnaire and the ethnic data were obtained from 2063 participants asked about self-reported skin color at early adulthood (23-25 years of age) in 2002/2004. Mothers of mulatto and black children had higher rates of low schooling (≤4 years, 27.2 and 38.0%) and lower family income (≤1 minimum wage, 28.6 and 30.4%). Mothers aged less than 20 years old predominated among mulattos (17.0%) and blacks (14.0%). Higher rates of low birth weight and smoking during pregnancy were observed among mulatto individuals (9.6 and 28.8%). Preterm birth rate was higher among mulattos (9.5%) and blacks (9.7%) than whites (5.5%). White individuals had higher rates of cesarean delivery (34.9%). Skin color remained as an independent risk factor for low birth weight (P &lt; 0.001), preterm birth (P = 0.01), small for gestational age (P = 0.01), and lack of prenatal care (P = 0.02) after adjustment for family income and maternal schooling, suggesting that the racial inequalities regarding these indicators are explained by the socioeconomic disadvantage experienced by mulattos and blacks but are also influenced by other factors, possibly by racial discrimination and/or genetics.

        <ab>The objective of the present study was to estimate and compare social inequality in terms of three indicators, i.e., low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA) birth, in three birth cohorts. Two cohorts were from the city of Ribeirão Preto, where data were collected for all 6748 live born singletons in 1978/79 and for one third of live born singletons (2846) in 1994. The third cohort consisted of 2443 singletons born in São Luís over a period of one year (1997/98). In Ribeirão Preto, LBW and PTB rates increased in all social strata from 1978/79 to 1994. Social inequalities regarding LBW and PTB disappeared since the increase in these rates was more accelerated in the groups with higher educational level. The percentage of SGA infants increased over the study period. Social inequality regarding SGA birth increased due to a more intense increase in SGA births in the strata with lower schooling. In São Luís, in 1997/98 there was no social inequality in LBW or PTB rates, whereas SGA birth rate was higher in mothers with less schooling. We speculate that the more accelerated increase in medical intervention, especially due to the increase in cesarean sections in the more privileged groups, could be the main factor explaining the unexpected increase in LBW and PTB rates in Ribeirão Preto and the decrease or disappearance of social inequality regarding these perinatal indicators in the two cities.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate possible effects on pregnancy, delivery and perinatal outcome in female survivors of polio. Methods: In a cohort design, data from the national population based Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) were used to compare all 2495 births recorded 1967–1998 by female survivors of polio with all 1.9 mill non-polio deliveries. The results were adjusted for time period, maternal age, and birth order by unconditional logistic regression, with effects presented as adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) with a corresponding 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and p values. Results: Female polio survivors had a higher occurrence of pre-eclampsia (3.4% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.003, OR = 1.4, CI = 1.1–1.7), gestational proteinuria (1.3% vs. 0.5%, p &lt; 0.001, OR = 2.0, CI = 1.4–2.8), renal disease prior to pregnancy (1.4% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.001, OR = 1.8, CI = 1.2–2.5), vaginal bleeding (3.8% vs. 2.0%, p &lt; 0.001, OR = 1.7, CI = 1.4–2.1), and urinary tract infection during pregnancy (3.5% vs. 2.4%, p &lt; 0.001, OR = 1.7, CI = 1.4–2.1). Deliveries complicated by obstruction of the birth process were more common in the polio group (6.1% vs. 2.0%, p &lt; 0.001, OR = 4.8, CI = 4.0–5.6), and cesarean section was performed at a higher rate throughout the time period (13.2% vs. 8.3%, p &lt; 0.001, OR = 2.7, CI = 2.4–3.1). Infants of polio mothers had a lower mean birth weight (3383 g vs. 3483 g, p &lt; 0.001), and more often had a birth weight below 2500 g (6.9% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.001, OR = 1.3, CI = 1.1–1.5). There was no difference regarding pregnancy length. The risk of perinatal death was increased (2.1% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.05, OR = 1.3, CI = 1.0–1.7). Conclusion: Pregnancy in female survivors of polio is associated with an increased risk for complications during pregnancy and delivery, as well as an adverse perinatal outcome. Awareness towards risk factors should improve pre-natal care and possibly prevent complications. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Adverse obstetric events have been implicated as risk factors for schizophrenia. Many studies have relied on retrospective recall of these events, given typical adult onset of schizophrenia, when most studies ascertain their samples. The goal of this study was to assess the validity of an interview for the long-term recall of prenatal and perinatal events. Ninety-six women from the Providence and Boston cohorts of the National Collaborative Perinatal Project were administered a brief structured telephone interview regarding their recall of pregnancy-related events that had occurred 22 years or more prior to interview. Women accurately reported major medical events such as cesarean section, breech delivery, and multiple birth (kappa = 1) and demographic items, such as age at birth and parity. Medical interventions and major medical conditions such as placental (kappa = - 0.01) and cord (kappa = - 0.10) difficulties were not accurately reported. Estimated birthweight, low birthweight, and length of gestation were recalled with reasonable accuracy. Women who completed high school generally recalled events more accurately than those who did not. It is therefore important to attend to the sources of information, the mode of interviewing, the specific type of event, and sociodemographic characteristics of the informant to improve the accuracy of retrospective data on obstetric events, and to increase the validity of findings relating these to the onset of schizophrenia.

        <ab>Objective: Public media reports of institutional Cesarean section rates have been used as a tool to reduce unnecessary surgical births. We examined women's awareness of the public release of this information according to socio-demographic characteristics in South Korea. Methods: The public release of institutional Cesarean section rates occurred on July 7, 2000. Seven months later, from February 7 to 14, 2001, we conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey of South Korean women aged 20-49 years (N = 505, response rate = 57.3%) with a nationwide sample using a proportionate quota and systematic random sampling method. Results: A total of 228 women (45.1% of 505) were aware of the public release of Cesarean section rates 7 months before. The awareness level differed by age and parity. After adjusting for age and parity, the awareness level was patterned by women's educational attainment and income. Women with low socioeconomic status held a lower awareness level compared with their counterparts. Level of respondent's interest in health related information was significantly associated with awareness of public release. Socioeconomic differentials in awareness were partly explained by the level of respondent's interest in health related information. Conclusion: Policy efforts to increase awareness of public media reports on institutional Cesarean section rates among disadvantaged women are needed.

        <ab>Objective: To investigate prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors for autism spectrum disorders by using participants identified through broad ascertainment and reliable classification methods. Methods: The targeted population was 8-year-old children born in 1994 and residing in 1 of the 3 most populous counties in Utah who were identified as having an autism spectrum disorder on the basis of methodology used by the 2002 Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. Of those identified, 132 children (115 boys, 17 girls) had birth certificate records available. Each child was matched by gender and birth year to 100 controls (11 500 boys, 1700 girls) from the birth certificate database in a nested case-control design. Birth certificate records of participants and controls were surveyed for 23 potentially pathologic prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal factors. Results: The prenatal factors that occurred significantly more frequently among children with autism spectrum disorders were advanced maternal age and parity. Increased duration of education among mothers of children with autism spectrum disorders was small but statistically significant. Significant perinatal factors were breech presentation and primary cesarean delivery. When corrected for breech presentation, a known indication for cesarean delivery, the association between primary cesarean delivery and autism spectrum disorders was eliminated. There were no significant associations found between autism spectrum disorders and neonatal factors. Conclusions: In the absence of other complications suggesting fetal distress, the association between breech presentation and autism spectrum disorders in this study suggests a shared etiology rather than causal relationship. Additional investigation focused on both genetic and environmental factors that link these autism spectrum disorder risk factors individually or collectively is needed.

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Method: A case–control study was conducted to compare perinatal outcomes among pregnant women with affective disorder (DSM-IV criteria) and who received SSRIs during pregnancy with those of women without an active psychiatric disorder during pregnancy who were non-exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Each case was matched to two controls for maternal age (± 2 years) and parity. Results: A total of 252 women were enrolled in the study, 84 exposed and 168 non-exposed. Demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. The rates of prelabor rupture of membranes, induction of labor and cesarean delivery were slightly higher but not statistically significant in the exposed group. The mean gestational age at birth was 38.8 (± 1.86) weeks for the exposed group and 39.4 (± 1.52) weeks for the non-exposed group (p = .005). Rates for preterm birth were higher in the exposed group (OR = 3.44, 95% CI = 1.30–9.11). After stratification for dose, it was found that exposure to a high-dose was associated with lower gestational age (p = .009) and higher rates of prematurity (OR = 5.07, 95% CI = 1.34–19.23). The differences remained significant after controlling for maternal status and the length of exposure. Conclusion: Women treated with SSRIs during pregnancy, mainly at high-dose, had an increased risk of preterm birth compared to healthy women of similar age and parity who were not exposed to SSRI during pregnancy.

        <ab>Objective: To examine risk factors and sequela for post partum discharge against medical advice. Methods: We conducted cross-sectional analyses of hospital discharge data linked to American Hospital Association data for women discharged following a live birth for California, Florida, and New York in the years 1998-2000. We examined rates, risk factors, hospital readmission rate and mortality (California only), associated with discharge against medical advice after controlling for patient and hospital characteristics. Results: Post partum discharge against medical advice averaged 0.10%. Rates were lowest among women following uncomplicated cesarean and vaginal births (0.07%), intermediate following complicated vaginal birth (0.21%) and highest following complicated cesarean birth (0.29%). African American race, lower income, public health insurance, no health insurance, or greater comorbidity, particularly drug abuse or psychotic illness, discharge from a hospital in California or New York (compared to Florida), and location in medium or large metropolitan areas, were associated with significantly higher rates of discharge against advice. Asian or Hispanic race or ethnicity and delivery at an obstetrical specialized hospital were associated with lower risk. Patients discharged against medical advice in California were significantly more likely to be re-admitted within 30 days (adjusted odds ratio 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-3.9), though none died during the period. Conclusions: Discharge against medical advice among post partum patients is uncommon, but occurs primarily among vulnerable women with psychosocial and medical risk factors. Thus, discharge against medical advice may help identify women who may benefit from additional maternal and/or child services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe sleep and fatigue during the first week of postpartum recovery, and compare women after cesarean delivery with women after vaginal delivery while their infants were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive exploratory study involved 21 postpartum Chinese American mothers (6 after cesarean delivery and 15 after vaginal delivery). Three types of data were collected: (1) mothers’ demographic data; (2) objective sleep that included total sleep time (TST) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) measured using wrist actigraphy, and (3) subjective sleep quality (General Sleep Disturbance Scale) and fatigue severity (Numerical Rating Scale—Fatigue). Results: All of the mothers experienced poor sleep while their 3- to 5-day-old infants were in the ICU. After cesarean birth, mothers averaged only about 4 hours TST with 34% WASO while still hospitalized, compared with 6.5 hours TST with 14% WASO for mothers after vaginal birth monitored in their home after hospital discharge. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances and fatigue need to be further investigated to better understand the relationship between type of delivery and maternal health outcomes. Despite infant care provided in ICUs, these new mothers could benefit from interventions to promote their own sleep, particularly when also recovering from cesarean delivery.

        <ab>Purpose: Cesarean delivery rates vary widely across populations. Studying communities with low rates of cesarean delivery may identify practices that can lower the cesarean rate. Methods: A population-based historical cohort study included all pregnant women (N = 1132) from 1992 through 1996 in a predominantly Native American region of northwestern New Mexico known to have a high prevalence of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. The outcomes studied included delivery type (eg, cesarean, operative vaginal, spontaneous vaginal), indication for cesarean delivery, presence of obstetrical risk factors, and use of labor induction or augmentation. Results: The cesarean delivery rate of the study group (7.3%) was only 35% of the 1996 US rate of 20.7%. Among study participants, the relative risk of a primary cesarean delivery for dystocia was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.14, 0.35). Trial of labor after cesarean delivery was attempted by 93% of study participants compared with 42% of women nationwide in 1994. The cesarean delivery rates for women with diabetes in pregnancy (11.5% versus 35.4%) and preeclampsia (14.8% versus 37.4%) were significantly lower than nationwide rates. Case-mix analysis comparison with a standardized population and comparison of standard (ie, term, singleton, vertex) primiparous women demonstrate that the low rate of cesarean delivery was not because of a lower prevalence of risk factors. Conclusions: The community's low rate of cesarean delivery is primarily the result of a decreased use of cesarean delivery for labor dystocia and an almost universal acceptance of trial of labor after cesarean delivery. Cultural attitudes toward childbirth, design of the perinatal system, and genetic factors also may explain the low rate of cesarean delivery.

        <ab>Background: In 2003, the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ) published its Quality Indicators for healthcare, and set out methodological criteria for the evaluation of potential candidates. Objectives: Because perinatal infections may result from poor obstetrical practices, we intended to describe the variability of maternal and congenital neonatal infections across different types of hospital ownership (e.g., not for profit, government), and to assess whether rates of these infections meet criteria as quality indicators. Research Design: Population-based cohort study. Subjects: All laboring women without maternal, fetal, or placental complications who delivered in California in 1997, and their neonates, as reported through hospital discharge data. Measures: A Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression model was used to quantify the effects of both 'patient-level' risk factors such as parity and prior cesarean history, and 'hospital-level' risk factors such as ownership and teaching status. Results: The 308,841 mother-newborn pairs in this low-risk study population delivered at 281 hospitals; 0.39% had uterine infections and 1.3% had neonatal infections. Hospital ownership and teaching status were strongly associated with perinatal infection. Secondly, methods used to estimate and analyze hospital-specific infection rates identified hospitals with exceptionally high rates. Twenty-eight hospitals had neonatal infection rates that ranged from 3% to 28%. Conclusions: The methods presented here were consistent with AHRQ methods and criteria for potential Quality Indicators. They also identified hospitals with exceptionally high rates of infectious morbidity. The relationship between hospital ownership and obstetrical practice patterns, and the feasibility of practice improvement, remain to be studied.

        <ab>Background: Cesarean section rates show a wide variation among countries in the world, ranging from 0.4 to 40 percent, and a continuous rise in the trend has been observed in the past 30 years. Our aim was to explore the association of cesarean section rates of different countries with their maternal and neonatal mortality and to test the hypothesis that in low-income countries, increasing cesarean section rates were associated with reductions in both outcomes, whereas in high-income countries, such association did not exist. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional multigroup ecological study using data from 119 countries from 1991 to 2003. These countries were classified into 3 categories: low-income (59 countries), medium-income (31 countries), and high-income (29 countries) countries according to an international classification. We assessed the ecological association between national cesarean section rates and maternal and neonatal mortality by fitting multiple linear regression models. Results: Median cesarean section rates were lower in low-income than in medium- and high-income countries. Seventy-six percent of the low-income countries, 16 percent of the medium-income countries, and 3 percent of high-income countries showed cesarean section rates between 0 and 10 percent. Three percent of low-income countries, 36 percent of medium-income countries, and 31 percent of high-income countries showed cesarean section rates above 20 percent. In low-income countries, a negative and statistically significant linear correlation was observed between cesarean section rates and neonatal mortality and between cesarean section rates and maternal mortality. No association was observed in medium- and high-income countries for either neonatal mortality or maternal mortality. Conclusions: No association between cesarean section rates and maternal or neonatal mortality was shown in medium- and high-income countries. Thus, it becomes relevant for future good-quality research to assess the effect of the high figures of cesarean section rates on maternal and neonatal morbidity. For low-income countries, and on confirmation by further research, making cesarean section available for high-risk pregnancies could contribute to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes, whereas a system of care with cesarean section rates below 10 percent would be unlikely to cover their needs.

        <ab>Comments on an article by S. Banger et al. (see record [rid]2016-59180-002[/rid]). In this issue of Functional Neurology, Bangar et al. address the main issues of practical relevance to clinicians treating female patients with epilepsy: epidemiology and clinical presentations (including catamenial epilepsy), contraception, reproductive and sexual dysfunction, pregnancy, lactation, menopause-related issues (including bone health), and mental health aspects. As mentioned by Bangar et al., safety data on newer anti-seizure medications are sparse. Also there is a lack of objective information about how the risks of behavioral and cognitive problems in offspring differ with amounts of medication exposure to the fetus. Levels of anti-seizure medication in the umbilical cord and breast milk are not known. As mentioned, women with epilepsy are as likely to achieve pregnancy as their healthy peers and will have similar pregnancy outcomes. More data are needed regarding pregnancy-related complications, neonatal outcomes and C-section rates, incidence of postpartum depression and anxiety in women with epilepsy as compared to the general population. The Maternal and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes of in Utero Antiepileptic Drug (AED) Exposure (MONEAD) study is a currently ongoing multicenter, prospective study. It is co-sponsored by Emory University, the EMMES Corporation and the NINDS. Overall goals of this study are to establish the relationship between antiepileptic drug exposure and outcomes in mother and child and to describe and explain the variability in antiepileptic drug exposure and response. The study may well answer some of the questions concerning various aspects of epilepsy in women and increase our knowledge on multiple levels to improve care and reduce adverse outcomes in women with epilepsy and their children.

        <ab>Background: The use of non-breast milks seems to cause more harm to the child's health than the isolated introduction of water/herbal teas. Aims: Study the factors associated with introduction of water/herbal teas or non-breast milks during the first month of life and determine the impact of this supplementation on breastfeeding duration. Study design: Nested cross-sectional study. Subjects: 220 mother-infant pairs contacted in the maternity ward, at 7 days and at the end of 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. Outcome measures: Introduction of water/herbal teas or non-breast milks in the first month of life based on data collected during a home visit 30 days after delivery. Results: Introduction of water/herbal teas was associated with maternal age &lt;20 years (prevalence ratio = 1.55; 95%CI 1.14-2.09), &lt;6 prenatal consultations (1.48; 1.09-2.01), cohabitation with maternal grandmother (1.51; 1.10-2.10), and poor latch-on at 30 days (1.87; 1.35-2.58). Introduction of non-breast milks was associated with breast feeding of previous children for &lt;6 months (3.18; 1.18-8.58), cesarean (1.92; 1.07-3.44), poor latch-on at 30 days (2.82; 1.55-5.11), use of pacifier at 7 days (2.75; 1.38-5.48), introduction of herbal teas in the first 7 days (2.75; 1.15-4.15) and breast engorgement at 7 days (2.19; 1.01-3.16). Introduction of non-breast milks negatively influenced breast feeding duration (p &lt; 0.001); this was not observed with water/herbal teas (p = 0.277). Conclusion: Priority should be given to preventing the early introduction on non-breast milks, especially in mother-infant pairs with associated risk factors.

        <ab>Background: Autism is considered to have a genetic basis, although exposure to certain stimuli in the prenatal period has been implicated to be causal in some cases. Some investigations have shown an association with obstetric complications but findings have been inconsistent owing to differences in sampling and methods. Objective: To examine the association of obstetric factors with autism spectrum disorders for a cohort of children, using obstetric data contained in a statutory database collected at the time of birth. Design: Subjects born in Western Australia between 1980 and 1995 and diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder by 1999 were included as cases (n=465). Siblings of the cases (n = 481) and a random population-based control group (n = 1313) were compared with the cases on obstetric information contained in the Maternal and Child Health Research Database of Western Australia. Results: Compared with control subjects, cases had significantly older parents and were more likely to be firstborn. Case mothers had greater frequencies of threatened abortion, epidural caudal anesthesia use, labor induction, and a labor duration of less than 1 hour. Cases were more likely to have experienced fetal distress, been delivered by an elective or emergency cesarean section, and had an Apgar score of less than 6 at 1 minute. Cases with a diagnosis of autism had more complications than those with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified or Asperger syndrome. Nonaffected siblings of cases were more similar to cases than control subjects in their profile of complications. Conclusions: Autism is unlikely to be caused by a single obstetric factor. The increased prevalence of obstetric complications among autism cases is most likely due to the underlying genetic factors or an interaction of these factors with the environment.

        <ab>Background: Cesarean delivery avoids perineal trauma and has therefore often been assumed to protect sexual function after childbirth. We sought to examine this assumption by using data from a study of women's sexual health after childbirth to assess whether women who underwent cesarean section experienced better sexual health in the postnatal period than women with vaginal births. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 796 primiparous women, employing data from obstetric records and a postal survey 6 months after delivery. Results: Any protective effect of cesarean section on sexual function was limited to the early postnatal period (0-3 months), primarily to dyspareunia-related symptoms. At 6 months the differences in dyspareunia-related symptoms, sexual response-related symptoms, and postcoital problems were much reduced or reversed, and none reached statistical significance. Conclusions: Outcomes from this study provide no basis for advocating cesarean section as a way to protect women's sexual function after childbirth.

        <ab>Background: A home confinement with midwifery care is still an integral part of Dutch maternity care. It has been argued that the existence of home birth itself influences the course of the birth process positively, which is why obstetric interventions are low in comparison with neighboring countries. This study examined the impact of women's intended place of birth (home or hospital) and the course of pregnancy and labor when attended by midwives. Methods: This is a prospective study of 625 low-risk pregnant women, gestation 20 to 24 weeks, enrolled in 25 independently working midwifery practices. The course of labor was measured by the frequency of interventions by midwives and obstetricians. Results: A more nontechnological approach to childbirth was observed within the women opting for a home birth compared with the women opting for a hospital birth. Data showed a relationship between interventions and planned birth site: sweeping membranes and amniotomy by midwives were more likely to be conducted in women opting for a home birth. Multiparas opting for hospital birth were more likely to experience consultations and referrals. Within the group of multiparas referred for obstetrician care, women intending to have a home birth experienced fewer interventions (e.g., induction, augmentation, pharmacologic pain relief, assisted delivery, cesarean section) compared with those who had opted for a hospital birth. Conclusions: A large proportion of women desire a home birth. The impact of that choice demonstrated a smoother course of the birth process, compared with women who desired to deliver in the hospital, as measured by fewer obstetric interventions. We suggest that psychological factors (expectation and perceptions) influence both a woman's decision of birthplace and the actual birth process.

        <ab>Introduction: Sexual perceptions and activities are influenced by pregnancy and childbirth due to both physical and emotional changes. Aim: Our goal was to illuminate the sexuality issues of concern to first-time parents (mothers and fathers) of healthy, singleton newborns in one U.S. academic hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Number of sexuality concerns and self-reported degree of resolution by months postpartum and gender of parent. Methods: Anonymous, cross-sectional postal survey of two first-time parent cohorts: 4 months postpartum (113 responses/404 mailed = 28.0%) and 12 months postpartum (99 responses/394 mailed = 25.1%). Results: Approximately half of the parents reported questions or concerns on between two and eight of 19 sexuality topics. Only 11% of participating mothers and 17% of participating fathers had one or no concerns (P = 0.27 by gender), and 17% of mothers and 9% of fathers had &gt;13 concerns (P = 0.12 by gender). There were fewer maternal concerns if they did not live with the father (P = 0.01), slightly fewer if the delivery was vaginal vs. cesarean (P = 0.07), and no differences by forceps/vacuum use or episiotomy/vaginal tear. The top concerns at 4 months postpartum were quite similar by gender and included when to resume intercourse, birth control, and the sexual impact of physical recovery from delivery. At 12 months, mothers and fathers both frequently reported a sexuality impact from the mother's body image concerns and desire discrepancy. One year postpartum, there were three sexuality topics with fairly high prevalence (more than one-third parents had this concern) that persisted (no self-reported resolution among at least one-third of parents): child-rearing differences with spouse, greater desire by the man than the woman, and the mother's body image. Conclusions: New mothers and fathers both have postpartum sexuality concerns/questions, many of which can be addressed by healthcare providers.

        <ab>Data were examined from two independent questionnaire-based longitudinal studies, 'KUB' in Sweden (N = 3113) and 'Greater Expectations?' (N = 1439) in England, which had similar aims and methodology. Our joint data sets offered us the opportunity to look for similarities and differences between the samples that might contribute to women's experiences of childbirth and mode of birth, as well as psychosocial sequelae. Analyses were restricted to those giving birth for the first time. We offer this as a 'worked example' of the limitations of post hoc comparison and as a demonstration of what can, none the less, be learnt. Analysis revealed many commonalities as well as a number of striking differences. The most robust finding was that Swedish primiparae were significantly more likely to have an unassisted vaginal birth. The data also suggest that they used more positive terms to describe themselves in labour, but these differences between the two samples were not reflected in the evaluation of childbirth overall. Regression analyses showed that the variables associated with an unassisted birth and with childbirth satisfaction were very similar in the two samples.

        <ab>Despite poor sensitivity and specificity, office blood pressure (BP) determinations are still the 'gold standard' for diagnosing gestational hypertension. This prospective blind study evaluates the prognostic value of office values as compared with ambulatory monitoring in pregnancy. We analyzed 2175 BP series systematically sampled from 355 non-preeclamptic pregnant women for 48 h every 4 wks from the first hospital visit until delivery. Women were divided for comparative purposes into three groups: 'detected' gestational hypertension, defined on the basis of casual clinical BP&gt; 140/90 mmHg after 20 wks of gestation and hyperbaric index (area of BP excess above the upper limit of a time-specified tolerance interval adjusted for the circadian pattern of the reference population) consistently above the threshold for diagnosing hypertension in pregnancy; 'undetected' gestational hypertension, women with office BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg but hyperbaric index consistently above the threshold for diagnosis; and normotension, women with both office values and hyperbaric index below the respective thresholds for diagnosis. Small and insignificant differences in the 24h mean BP between 'detected' and 'undetected' gestational hypertension is observed in all trimesters, in contrast with highly significant differences between these two groups and normotensive pregnancies. Normotensive women are characterized by highly significant lesser incidence by 60% in preterm delivery, 70% in intrauterine growth retardation, and 50% in delivery by cesarean section (p &lt; 0.001) compared with women with 'detected' and 'undetected' gestational hypertension (p &gt; 0.715). In pregnancy, the hyperbaric index is markedly superior to office BP measurements for diagnosis of what should be truly considered gestational hypertension, and for prediction of the outcome of pregnancy.

        <ab>Determined if a family physician's overall approach to maternity care, as measured by average use of epidural analgesia, was associated with maternal and fetal outcomes. Retrospective analysis was conducted of the births of 3 cohorts of 1992 nulliparous, low-risk women attended by 96 family physicians within an 18-mo period in the department of family practice at the largest maternity hospital in Canada. Cohorts were based on the physicians' mean use of epidural analgesia for the women. Family physicians were separated into cohorts based on their mean use of epidural analgesia at rates of: low, 0-30% (15 physicians, 263 births); medium, 31-50% (55 physicians, 1323 births); and high, 51-100% (26 physicians, 406 births). After adjustment for maternal age and race, patients of low versus high epidural users were admitted at a later state of cervical dilation, received less electronic fetal monitoring and oxytocin augmentation, sustained fewer malpositions, had fewer cesarean sections, less obstetric consultation, and fewer newborn special care admissions. In this setting, high use of epidural analgesia is a marker for a style of practice characterized by malpositions leading to dysfunctional labors and higher intervention rates leading, in turn, to excess maternal/newborn morbidity.

        <ab>Objective: To identify factors affecting exclusive breastfeeding in maternity hospital care and during the first six months after birth. Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys form the basis of this study: the first, conducted in 1995 on maternity wards (n = 11 422 newborns) and the second, conducted in 1997 in primary care centers (n = 10 156 infants under six months). Results: The most meaningful factors in hospital care were: cesarean section, breastfeeding initiation after 2 h, lack of skin to skin contact, use of pacifiers, separation longer than 1h/24 h and health problems of infants. After hospital discharge the most significant factors were: use of pacifiers, mother's reluctance to exclusive breastfeeding longer then four months, low level of mother and father education. Conclusions: Most of identified factors can be modified so our results can help to introduce more effective target intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Examined absolute and proportional gestational weight gain and prepregnancy body mass index as predictors of primary cesarean delivery. Data were derived from a prospective study of pregnancy outcome risk factors in 2,301 women who had singleton deliveries by primary cesarean (N = 312) or vaginal delivery (N = 1,989) and for whom height, prepregnancy weight, and weight gain were available. Women were divided into 4 body mass index groups (underweight, low average, high average, and obese) and further subdivided into 8 groups according to median proportional or absolute weight gain. Risk of cesarean delivery increased with increasing body mass index and gestational weight gain greater than the median for one's body mass index. Proportional weight gain was more predictive of cesarean delivery than absolute weight gain. Underweight women gaining more than 27.8% of their prepregnancy weight had a 2-fold adjusted relative risk of cesarean delivery. It is concluded that proportional weight gain is in important predictor of cesarean delivery for underweight women; high body mass index is also predictive of increased risk.

        <ab>Examined the relationship between method of pain management during labor and birth outcomes. A retrospective comparative chart review of 233 primiparous deliveries was conducted and group assignment was based on method of pain control (nonnarcotic, narcotic, or epidural). Epidural analgesia or anesthesia was associated with increased rates of instrumental and cesarean delivery. Augmentation of labor using a synthetic oxytocin was reported in more charts than expected, and the length of the 2nd stage of  labor was longer in those who received epidural analgesia or anesthesia. Apgar scores for those who received early epidural analgesia or anesthesia were lower than for those who received late or no epidural analgesia or anesthesia, although Apgar scores were satisfactory across all groups. Between-groups differences were unrelated to time of epidural placement or maternal temperature. Findings are relevant for maternal child nurses who serve as a resource for families wishing to make informed decisions about pain management in labor.

        <ab>Examined the impact of an unanticipated primary cesarean section on the mother, on the infant, and on their interaction during the perinatal period and at 1 mo following delivery. 34 mother–infant pairs served as Ss: 14 mothers who delivered by nonelective, nonemergency cesarean section and 20 mothers who delivered vaginally (controls). All Ss had attended a series of prepared childbirth classes. Maternal questionnaire (Neuroticism Scale Questionnaire) and infant observational (Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale) data were collected on Day 2 and Day 30. Mother–infant interactions in teaching and play sessions were assessed on Day 30. The cesarean group had a higher number of obstetrical complications, an increased incidence of maternal depression, and a more difficult convalescence. Previous experience with children emerged as an important mediating variable in the analysis of maternal affective status. No infant behavioral differences were detected as a function of mode of delivery. Interventions that can be utilized to minimize the negative emotional consequences for women who deliver by cesarean section are discussed.

        <ab>Background: To investigate determinants of development of postpartum depression among women in Yerevan, Armenia. Method: A case–control study of all reproductive age (18–45) women having 1–3 months old children registered in 7 Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities, in Yerevan. We used Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and a structured questionnaire to assess possible postpartum depression status of mothers and exposure status through telephone interviews. Results: The study had a 96.7% response rate for 63 cases and 272 controls. The prevalence of possible postpartum depression was 14.4%. The risk of possible postpartum depression associated with age less than 25 years at childbirth was increased only among women who delivered their child through C-section (OR = 7.8; 95% CI: 1.5–40.7). Meanwhile, this risk was much lower among women who delivered through vaginal delivery (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.4–1.8). Limitations: EPDS had not been translated and validated in Armenia. Study population included only women having 1–3 months old children. Conclusion: The study suggested that the effect of younger age at last childbirth on the risk of possible postpartum depression development was higher for women who gave birth through C-section compared to those with vaginal delivery. Despite the stressful and crisis conditions existing in Armenia over the past 2 decades the prevalence of possible postpartum depression does not differ much from that in other societies.

        <ab>Reports an error in 'Symptoms of eating disorders and feeding practices in obese mothers' by Vincenzo Zanardo, Gianluca Straface, Barbara Benevento, Irene Gambina, Francesco Cavallin and Daniele Trevisanuto (Early Human Development, 2014[Feb], Vol 90[2], 93-96). In the original article, the affiliation of Francesco Cavallin was incorrectly given. The corrected affiliation of the author is present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-03695-005[/rid]). Background: The potential that obesity in pregnancy has to affect symptoms associated with eating disorders and breastfeeding is unclear. Aim: This study analyzed symptoms of eating disorders and breastfeeding practices in obese mothers. Study design: Prospective, case–control study. Subjects: Participants included 25 obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m²) and 25 normal-weight puerperae, matched for parity and delivery route. Outcome measures: The participants completed the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2), investigating cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms of eating disorders before they were discharged from the maternity hospital and later participated in telephone interviews concerning breastfeeding practices which were classified according to WHO definitions. Results: Although none of the scores fell in the pathological range, the obese mothers had more and more pronounced symptoms of eating disorders in all EDI-2 subscales with respect to normal-weight mothers. They had, in particular, significantly higher scores in body dissatisfaction (p &lt; .0001), ineffectiveness (p = .004), interoceptive awareness (p = .005), and maturity fear (p = .007). Finally, while breastfeeding practices were similar in the two groups, the obese mothers were more likely to maintain full breastfeeding at 6 months (20 vs 8%) and their tendency to postpone weaning was found to be significant (p &lt; .04). Conclusions: While the obese mothers studied have more pronounced symptoms of eating disorders with respect to their normal-weight counterparts, they tended to maintain breastfeeding longer, postponing weaning.

        <ab>Three studies investigated the changing patterns and effects of caffeine use of 286 women participating in a prenatal prospective study using prospective information gathered through the course of pregnancy, perinatal measurements, and retrospective data collected postnatally. Data were collected on maternal use of tea, coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, chocolate bars and drinks, and caffeinated medication. The volume and analyzed caffeine concentration of 53 samples of coffee and tea, prepared by Ss as they usually consumed it, were used to examine the predictive potential of the Ss' subjective description of the beverages. Results show that self-reports of volume and beverage strength were valid predictors; however, the method of coffee preparation had little predictive power. An algorithm developed for estimating caffeine intake retrospectively over time revealed that during pregnancy, most Ss continued to consume caffeine but usually at lower intake levels. After pregnancy, caffeine consumption tended to persist at reduced levels for several months and then returned to prepregnancy patterns. Maternal caffeine intake of more than 300 mg/day during pregnancy was associated with lowered birth weight and smaller head circumference of the infant after accounting for maternal nicotine use. No relationship was apparent between maternal caffeine use and the incidence of caesarian sections, breech births, miscarriages, or premature births.

        <ab>Objectives: Global estimates of maternal and perinatal mortality have remained unchanged over the past 20 years, and strategies are being sought to decrease the occurrence of maternal and perinatal death. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between inter-pregnancy interval and the occurrence of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Methods Design and Settings: Cross-sectional study of the obstetrical and perinatal records in an intra-hospital obstetrics database between 1986 and 2000 at a tertiary maternity hospital in Brazil. Participants: A total of 14,930 records of parous women who delivered singleton infants. Main outcome measures: Crude and adjusted odds ratio estimates of gestational outcome according to inter-pregnancy intervals. Results: during the period of the study, 34.6% of records referred to women with an inter-pregnancy interval &lt;18 months. After the adjustment performed for 11 confounding factors and assuming an inter-pregnancy interval of 18-23 months as reference, short intervals (&lt;6 months) were observed to be associated with a greater risk of low birth weight (odds ratio: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.18-2.55), and preterm birth (1.56; 1.01-2.46). On the other hand, long intervals were significantly associated with fewer C-sections (0.69; 0.56-0.82), and a greater risk of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) (1.57; 1.20-2.06) and low birth weight (1.46; 1.03-2.06). Conclusions: Short inter-pregnancy intervals are associated with a higher risk of low birth weight and preterm birth, while long intervals are associated with a higher risk of PROM, low birth weight and a lower risk of C-section.

        <ab>Objective: To examine the association between decision to delivery interval and maternal and baby outcomes. Design: National cross sectional survey. Setting: Maternity units in England and Wales. Subjects: reviewed 17,780 singleton births (99% of all births) delivered by emergency caesarean section in England and Wales between 1 May 2000 and 31 July 2000. Main outcome measures: Association between decision to delivery interval and baby outcomes (Apgar scores of &lt;7 and &lt;4 at five minutes and stillbirth) and maternal outcomes (requirement for special care additional to routine care after caesarean section and where care was provided). Results: Compared with babies delivered within 15 minutes, there was no difference in maternal or baby outcome for decision to delivery interval between 16 and 75 minutes. After 75 minutes, however, there was a significantly higher odds of a five minute Apgar score of &lt;7 (odds ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.4), and 50% increase in odds of special care additional to routine care for mothers. Conclusion: A decision to delivery interval of 30 minutes is not an absolute threshold for influencing baby outcome. Decision to delivery intervals of more than 75 minutes are associated with poorer maternal and baby outcomes and should be avoided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Reply by the current author the comments made by George Giannakopoulos (see record [rid]2015-44938-009[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2015-27713-006[/rid]). Giannakopoulos raises a valid point that there is uncertainty regarding how cesarean delivery should be incorporated into an analysis of the association between antidepressant medication use late in pregnancy and the risk of PPHN. If cesarean delivery is on the causal pathway, then adjusting for it would be inappropriate. We note, however, that conditioning on cesarean delivery in this scenario would not necessarily result in a null-biased estimate of the total causal effect. Although conditioning may remove part of the exposure effect, it can also induce an association between the exposure and the outcome if there are unmeasured confounders for the association between cesarean delivery and PPHN. Cesarean delivery may function as a confounder by sharing a common cause with antidepressant medication use. However, our analyses were restricted to a cohort of women with a depression diagnosis, so we adjusted for associated factors in our analyses.

        <ab>Comments on an article by Wax et al (see record [rid]2005-10212-007[/rid]). According to the authors, 80 percent of Maine obstetricians surveyed favor a randomized controlled trial of elective primary cesarean versus vaginal birth. Leaving aside the ethical issues of assigning healthy women to undergo major surgery, if these authors believe that the evidence justifies such a trial, they are mistaken. To illustrate this point, the current article presents a hypothetical sample 'Informed Consent' document consistent with the observational research. It would be interesting to know how many obstetricians who defend a woman's right to choose elective primary cesarean also honor her right to choose a vaginal birth after cesarean, a vaginal breech birth, or a home birth.

        <ab>Comments on the article by M. F. MacDorman et al (see record [rid]2006-11200-002[/rid]) that attempts to address the risks of the increasing cesarean delivery rate, and the potential risks of an increased rate of cesarean delivery by maternal request, in a retrospective review of a United States linked birth-infant death database. The abstract of the article reports mortality risks of 1.77 versus 0.62 per 1,000 for cesarean delivery versus vaginal delivery, which is probably an overestimate.

        <ab>Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Caroline de Costa et al. (see record [rid]2008-11939-019[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2007-17960-005[/rid]). The authors' point is that many babies are separated from their mothers after birth following elective procedures when we would not normally associate this separation within the low-risk cohort. In fact, it appears that our study paints an accurate and rather conservative picture of the state of affairs for term babies born following elective procedures in Australia. The commentators found not only higher rates of admission across each gestational age group, but also reported the death of two infants after elective cesarean section. In light of these new findings, we do not believe our paper is unduly alarming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Explored the mother–child relationship in 16 20–30 yr old mothers delivered by emergency caesarian section (Group 1) and compared them with 16 age-matched controls who had normal vaginal deliveries (Group 2). Group 1 had a period of amnesia after the birth so that their recollected first contact with their babies was later than that of Group 2; and at 1 mo, Group 1 had much less eye-to-eye contact with their babies than Group 2. There were differences in attitudes and behavior between the 2 groups at 1 mo and at 1 yr. Group 1 had more doubts about their capacity to care for their babies, were more depressed with symptoms, and felt their babies did not become a person until later. There were no differences between the 2 groups of children in general behavior and development, although the babies of Group 1 Ss were larger; this difference persisted for 1 yr. Group 1 found adjusting to the birth of their first baby and parenthood more difficult than Group 2. (29 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>Reports an error in 'A study of postpartum depression and maternal risk factors in Qatar' by F. Tuna Burgut, Abdulbari Bener, Suheila Ghuloum and Javaid Sheikh (Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, 2013[Jun], Vol 34[2], 90-97). In the original article, the authors omitted the following reference: Bener A, Burgut FT, Ghuloum S, Sheikh J. A study of postpartum depression in a fast developing country: prevalence and related factors. Int J Psychiat Med 2012;43:325–337. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-19649-006[/rid]). Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p = 0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.

        <ab>Studied longitudinally the experience of hospital inpatient stays at childbirth of 96 first-time parents during the transition to parenthood. For women, the prospect of birth was a major worry during pregnancy. Negative expectations proved in general to be justified by events, with many women reporting predominantly bad memories of the experience. Satisfaction with the hospital inpatient stay was also considered. A major source of dissatisfaction was inadequate help with breastfeeding. Middle-class mothers were more dissatisfied with their hospital stay, as were women who had Caesarean births. Relationships were found between prenatal class attendences and the likelihood of a normal delivery and reported pain during childbirth. More than ⅔ of the fathers were present for the delivery, and about ½ were at the labor. Fathers' experiences at this time were more positive than that of their partners, but during the hospital stay, this role was much more marginal.

        <ab>Explored 111 infants' (aged 4–4.5 mo) perception of the temporal pattern of motion in 2 studies. Study 1 used a familiarization-novelty paradigm to demonstrate that 4-mo-old infants discriminate 2 repetitive temporal patterns. Study 2 used a preferential-looking paradigm longitudinally at 4 and 8 mo with all the possible pairs of 3 repetitive patterns representing 3 levels of complexity. Visual preference shifted from the medium-complexity pattern at 4 mo to the high-complexity pattern at 8 mo. Evidence was obtained at 4 mo that Ss discriminated between all 3 patterns of motion. Data indicate that Ss who were born in complicated deliveries (inductions, forceps, or Caesarean sections) did not, as a group, distinguish among the patterns at 4 mo.

        <ab>Reports an error in 'Predictors of preterm births and low birthweight in an inner-city hospital in sub-Saharan Africa' by Bolajoko O. Olusanya and Gabriel E. Ofovwe (Maternal and Child Health Journal, 2010[Nov], Vol 14[6], 978-986). There were errors in the original article and the corrections consequent on the use of 'row' rather than 'column' percentages in the formula Pe (OR — 1)/OR as stated under the statistical methods. Further corrections are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2010-22218-019[/rid]). Adverse birth outcomes remain significant contributors to perinatal mortality as well as developmental disabilities worldwide but limited evidence exists in sub-Saharan Africa based on a conceptual framework incorporating neighborhood context. This study therefore set out to determine the prevalence and risk factors for preterm births and low birthweight in an urban setting from this region. A cross-sectional study of all live births from May 2005 to December 2007 in an inner-city maternity hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. Factors predictive of preterm births and low birthweight were determined by unconditional multivariable logistic regression within a conceptual framework for adverse birth outcomes. Population attributable risk (PAR%) for each factor was also determined. Of the 4,314 newborns enrolled, 859 (19.9%) were preterm and 440 (10.2%) were low birthweight. One-third of mothers received no antenatal care while about 6% had HIV and another 6% had a history of hypertensive disorders. About 43% of the low birthweight infants were born full term. Maternal predictors of preterm delivery and/or low birthweight were marital status, occupation, residential accommodation with shared sanitation facilities, lack of antenatal care, absence of previous cesarean section, hypertensive disorders and antepartum hemorrhage. Gender and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were also predictive of low birthweight. IUGR (PAR = 48.74%) and lack of prior cesarean section (PAR = 41.99%) were the leading contributors to preterm birth and/or low birthweight. The burden of preterm and low birthweight deliveries in this setting is associated with modifiable individual and neighborhood-level risk factors that warrant community-oriented public health interventions.

        <ab>Conducted a longitudinal study of cognitive and motor development among infants born to 58 adolescent mothers (mean age at delivery 16.3 yrs) and a control group of 59 adult mothers (mean age at delivery 22.6 yrs). The experimental and control groups were matched on race (White/Black), parity, prenatal care, and socioeconomic status (SES). Data were obtained on antepartum, delivery, and postpartum performance of the Ss, along with data on infant status within each maternal group. Additionally, infants from each maternal group were followed longitudinally over the 1st yr of life. Measures of infant mental and motor development test performance on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) were obtained at 6 and 12 mo of age. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) was also used to obtain ratings of the infant home environment at 6 and 12 mo of age. However, birth weight, cesarean section, and labor and delivery complications were significantly related to race, with Black Ss experiencing less favorable outcomes on these variables. Infants born to adolescent mothers scored significantly lower on the Mental Development index of the BSID relative to controls. Black infants also performed significantly lower on this index compared to White infants. Home environments of infants born to adolescents were found to be significantly less nurturant than those of controls, and the HOME ratings for Black Ss were significantly lower than those for Whites.

        <ab>Examined birth conditions and resulting temperamental development after the 1st 5 yrs in 18 male and 19 female children. Data from a longitudinal study were used that had been obtained through periodic interviews with parents. Birth conditions included natural childbirth, forceps, breech, cesarean, and premature. Temperament variables included approach and withdrawal, adaptability, intensity of reaction, distractibility, and attention span and persistence. Results indicate a tendency for children born via natural childbirth to be perceived as exhibiting lesser degrees of the different temperamental variables, including less adaptability and less persistence.

        <ab>Satisfaction with social support was studied longitudinally in 113 17–40 yr old Israeli women following the outcome of both normal and medically complicated pregnancies (delivery by cesarean section, delivery of an infant weighing under 2 kg, or spontaneous abortion before the 3rd trimester). Ss were interviewed concerning the size of their social networks, the number of friends and family members in their networks, perceived intimacy with spouse, and perceived intimacy with at least 1 friend and 1 family member. Included in the interviews were measures of self-esteem, intimacy, social network structure, and satisfaction with support. Findings show that greater intimacy with spouse and with friends was related to greater satisfaction with support received during the crisis period. Intimate ties contributed to satisfaction with support independent of self-esteem, social network parameters, and type of pregnancy outcome. Social network parameters and pregnancy outcome were not related to satisfaction with support. Among Ss low in self-esteem, greater intimacy with family was related to lower satisfaction with support if the Ss lacked intimate ties with spouse or a friend. Clinical and social psychological theories regarding reaction to aid are discussed. (37 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)</ab>

        <ab>The childbirth preferences and attitudes of young women prior to pregnancy (N = 758) were explored in a cross-sectional survey. Sources of influential childbirth information and self-reported childbirth learning needs were described. Young women’s attitudes about childbirth, including the degree of confidence in coping with a vaginal birth, whether birth is considered a natural event, and expectations of labor pain were associated with their mode of birth preference. Conversations with friends and family were the most influential source of childbirth information. Gaps in knowledge about pregnancy and birth were identified. An improved understanding of women’s preferences and attitudinal profiles can inform the structure and content of educational strategies that aim to help the next generation of maternity care consumers participate in informed decision making.
